The analysis reveals 3 CRITICAL and 7 HIGH severity vulnerabilities that pose immediate security risks.\n\nKEY SECURITY CONCERNS:\n1. Command Injection: BashGod's parameter substitution mechanism allows direct shell injection\n2. Privilege Escalation: Multiple sudo-enabled commands lack proper parameter validation\n3. HTM Storage: Sensitive tensor data stored without encryption\n4. Authentication: API endpoints lack proper authentication mechanisms\n5. Input Validation: Security patterns can be bypassed through various encoding techniques\n\nIMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:\nThe current implementation presents unacceptable security risks for any production deployment. Critical vulnerabilities must be resolved before the system can be safely deployed in any environment with network access or elevated privileges.",
