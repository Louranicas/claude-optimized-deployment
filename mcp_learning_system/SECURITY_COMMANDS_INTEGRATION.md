# Security Monitoring Commands Integration Instructions

## Overview
This integration adds 115+ real security monitoring commands to the bash god MCP server.

## Integration Steps

1. **Import the commands in bash_god_mcp_server.py:**
   ```python
   from bash_god_security_commands import SECURITY_MONITORING_COMMANDS
   ```

2. **Add to the command library in the appropriate section:**
   ```python
   # In the command initialization section
   for cmd in SECURITY_MONITORING_COMMANDS:
       self.commands[cmd['id']] = cmd
   ```

3. **Update category counts:**
   The security_monitoring category now has 115+ commands across 6 subcategories:
   - network_security: 25 commands
   - system_security: 25 commands
   - vulnerability_assessment: 20 commands
   - incident_response: 20 commands
   - compliance_auditing: 15 commands
   - threat_intelligence: 10 commands

## Command Structure
Each command includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Human-readable name
- `description`: What the command does
- `command_template`: The actual command to execute
- `examples`: Usage examples
- `performance_hints`: Optimization tips
- `category`: Always "security_monitoring"
- `subcategory`: Specific security domain
- `tags`: Optional categorization tags

## Testing
Run the validation script to ensure all commands are properly formatted:
```bash
python3 validate_security_commands.py
```

## Security Considerations
- These are real security commands, not simulations
- Many require elevated privileges (sudo/root)
- Some commands can impact system performance
- Always test in a safe environment first
- Follow organizational security policies

## Production Deployment
1. Review all commands for your environment
2. Adjust paths and parameters as needed
3. Set up proper logging and monitoring
4. Configure rate limiting for sensitive operations
5. Implement access controls based on user roles
