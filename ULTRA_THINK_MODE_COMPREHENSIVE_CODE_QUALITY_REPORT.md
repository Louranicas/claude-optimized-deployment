## üìã Specific Refactoring Recommendations

### 1. Code Complexity Reduction

#### `code_quality_analysis.py` (Priority: CRITICAL)
```python
# Current: 144 complexity - UNACCEPTABLE
# Needs: Complete refactoring into multiple smaller modules
# Target: Break into 5-7 smaller files with complexity <20 each
```

#### `test_all_mcp_servers_parallel.py` (Priority: HIGH)
```python
# Current: 72 complexity
# Recommendation: Extract test utilities into separate modules
# Implement test factory patterns
```

### 2. Rust Error Handling Improvement

```rust
// Replace this pattern:
let result = risky_operation().unwrap();

// With proper error handling:
let result = risky_operation()
    .map_err(|e| CustomError::RiskyOperationFailed(e))?;
```

### 3. Python Best Practices

```python
# Replace bare except:
try:
    risky_operation()
except:  # ‚ùå BAD
    pass

# With specific exception handling:
try:
    risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:  # ‚úÖ GOOD
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    raise
```
