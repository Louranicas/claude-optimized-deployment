User Session:

Scenario: JIT Inc. needs to keep an eye on user session activity to spot any unusual behavior because insider attacks and account takeovers are becoming a bigger danger.
How It Assists: The network’s active user sessions are monitored and examined via the User Session dashboard. This entails keeping an eye on access trends, session lengths, and login times. With the use of this data, JIT Inc. will be able to spot anomalous session activity, such as access to critical resources, sessions at strange times, or sessions lasting unusually long, all of which could point to a compromised account or insider threat.

Implementation and Analysis

Continuous checking for Asset and Identity Management: JIT Inc. can keep accurate records of its assets and user identities by routinely checking the dashboards for asset and identity data. This ensures that any inconsistencies or abnormalities are promptly found and fixed.
Proactively Detecting Security events: JIT Inc. can potentially avert security events related to insider threats or compromised accounts by using the User Session dashboard to proactively detect and respond to odd user behaviors.
Security Policies and Compliance: JIT Inc. may improve its asset and identity management security policies with the use of these dashboards’ insights, ensuring that they adhere to legal and industry requirements.

The identity domain dashboards in Splunk ES are essential for JIT Inc. to manage and secure their identities and digital assets. By successfully utilizing these dashboards, JIT Inc. may ensure the integrity and security of their network and sensitive data by monitoring, analyzing, and responding to identity-related security issues.
Case Studies
Here are three case studies illustrating the successful use of Splunk in forensic investigations within the security domain. These examples showcase how Splunk can help organizations identify, analyze, and respond to cyber threats and incidents more effectively.
Case Study: Financial Services Company - Insider Threat Investigation

Problem: A financial services company suspected an insider threat after detecting unusual activity in its network. The company needed to identify the source of the suspicious activity, determine if any sensitive data had been compromised, and implement appropriate remediation measures.
Solution: The company used Splunk to conduct a forensic investigation, collecting and analyzing data from various sources, including system logs, network traffic, and user activity. Splunk’s advanced analytics capabilities allowed the company to identify patterns and anomalies, ultimately tracing the suspicious activity back to a rogue employee.
Results: The financial services company used the insights gained from the Splunk investigation to take appropriate action against the rogue employee and implement stronger security measures to prevent future insider threats. The company also improved its monitoring and detection capabilities by leveraging Splunk’s real-time analytics.

Case Study: E-commerce Company - Data Breach Investigation

Problem: An e-commerce company experienced a data breach resulting in the exposure of customer payment information. The company needed to identify the root cause of the breach, assess the extent of the damage, and implement appropriate remediation measures.
Solution: The e-commerce company engaged a forensic investigation team that leveraged Splunk to conduct a thorough analysis of its systems, network, and logs. The team used Splunk’s powerful search and data visualization capabilities to identify the source of the breach and track the attackers’ activities.
Results: The forensic investigation, aided by Splunk, helped the e-commerce company pinpoint the vulnerabilities exploited by the attackers, assess the scope of the breach, and remediate the issue. As a result, the company improved its security posture, implemented more robust monitoring and detection capabilities, and was able to provide a detailed report of the incident to relevant stakeholders.

Case Study: Healthcare Organization - Ransomware Attack Investigation

Problem: A healthcare organization fell victim to a ransomware attack, with critical systems and patient data being encrypted and held for ransom. The organization needed to identify the source of the attack, assess the extent of the damage, and restore its systems as quickly as possible.
Solution: The healthcare organization utilized Splunk to perform a forensic investigation, collecting and analyzing data from affected systems, network traffic, and security logs. Splunk’s advanced analytics helped the organization identify the ransomware’s infection vector, trace its propagation within the network, and understand its behavior.
Results: With the insights gained from the Splunk-based forensic investigation, the healthcare organization was able to effectively respond to the ransomware attack, mitigate its impact, and restore affected systems. The organization also used the information gathered to strengthen its security measures, improve monitoring and detection capabilities, and better prepare for future cyber threats.

Conclusion
The chapter on Forensic Investigation in Security Domains has come to a close. We have looked at the key elements of a forensic investigation and examined domains including Access, Endpoint, Network, and Identity. Each domain contributed a distinct viewpoint to the investigative process and was essential in identifying, evaluating, and reducing security vulnerabilities. The case studies demonstrated the complexity of cyber forensics and offered useful real-world applications of these principles.
We will expand on these ideas as we move into our next chapter, Splunk Integration with Other Security Tools, and examine how Splunk ES, a flexible security platform, can be improved by being integrated with other security tools to create a more complete and robust cybersecurity framework.
Points to Remember

To ascertain the reason of a security issue or to assist legal procedures, forensic investigations systematically gather, preserve, analyze, and present digital evidence.
Digital artifacts that can be used to recreate the sequence of events leading up to a security incident include logs, files, emails, network traffic, and other digital artifacts.
The chain of custody must be followed to protect the validity of digital evidence. It records how evidence is handled and preserved in order to guarantee its admissibility in court.
Forensic investigation and incident response go hand in hand. While forensic investigation focuses on determining the source and scope of the breach, incident response concentrates on containment and recovery.
The steps of a forensic inquiry normally go as follows: Establish the policies, methods, and tools needed for the inquiry as part of your preparation. (a) Identification: Identify and notify others of a possible security incident. (b) Gathering: Maintain the integrity of digital evidence while gathering and storing it. (c) Analysis: Look over the information gathered to ascertain the reason for the incident, its scope, and its effects. (d) Reporting: Summarize findings, offer suggestions, and update pertinent parties. (e) Corrective action: Take steps to stop similar occurrences in the future.
To assist with the investigative process, a number of forensic tools are available, including disk imaging tools, file recovery tools, network forensics tools, and malware analysis tools.
Dead forensics deal with gathering data from a system that has been shut down, whereas live forensics gather data from a system that is still in use. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the particulars of the research.
To precisely reconstruct the timeline of the occurrence and connect events across many systems, time synchronization is crucial in forensic investigations.
To make sure that their investigations abide by relevant laws and professional standards, forensic investigators should be knowledgeable on legal, ethical, and privacy rules.
For a forensic investigation to be effective, cooperation and communication between many teams and stakeholders, including security analysts, IT employees, legal counsel, and law enforcement, are crucial.
