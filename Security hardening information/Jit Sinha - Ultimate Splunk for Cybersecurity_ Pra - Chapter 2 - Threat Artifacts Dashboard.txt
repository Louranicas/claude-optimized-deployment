Threat Artifacts Dashboard:

Scenario: In order to determine the extent and possible consequences of a suspected phishing attack, JIT Inc. must examine the related artifacts.
How It Assists: The Hazardous Relics Dashboard enables JIT Inc. to investigate particular danger indicators found within the network in further detail. Analyzing URLs, file hashes, and IP addresses connected to the phishing campaign are all part of this process. Through the analysis of these artifacts, JIT Inc. may determine the source, mode, and possible targets of the attack within the company, resulting in more potent mitigation techniques.

Implementation and Analysis

Proactive Monitoring: To stay informed of new dangers, JIT Inc. keeps a close eye on both dashboards. This proactive strategy aids in the early identification and handling of possible security events.
Incident Investigation and Response: These dashboards provide JIT Inc. with extensive insights that facilitate in-depth investigations and the development of effective response plans in the case of an identified danger.
Improved Security Posture: JIT Inc. is able to improve its overall cybersecurity posture by streamlining firewall rules, optimizing security measures, and conducting regular analysis of threat activity and artifacts.

The Threat Activity and Threat Artifacts dashboards from Splunk ES are essential parts of JIT Inc.’s cybersecurity arsenal. These dashboards offer thorough insights into the threat landscape, making it easier to identify and neutralize cyberthreats in a timely manner. Through the utilization of these technologies, JIT Inc. improves its capacity to protect its digital assets and uphold operational integrity in the face of a constantly changing variety of cyber threats.
Protocol Intelligence
In order to identify potential threats, abnormalities, and to improve network security, protocol intelligence entails tracking, analyzing, and comprehending network protocols. Security teams can examine protocol-related occurrences and put preventative measures in place to strengthen their organization’s security posture by utilizing protocol intelligence.

Monitoring and analyzing network protocols: Splunk ES is used to gather, process, and store network traffic data for monitoring network protocols. This information offers perceptions into the performance, communication patterns, and general wellness of the network. Security analysts can find possible hazards, spot anomalies, and identify problem areas by evaluating this data.
Detecting protocol-based threats and anomalies: By comparing network traffic data with threat intelligence feeds, user activity, and other security-related data sources, Splunk ES can identify protocol-based threats and anomalies. This procedure aids in the detection of potential assaults like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), the spread of malware, or attempts at data espionage. Security teams can promptly respond to crises and minimize potential damage by identifying these dangers early.
Using Splunk ES to further examine protocol-related incidents: When a protocol-related issue is identified, Splunk ES provides a number of tools to do so. In order to comprehend the incident’s underlying causes, affected systems, and prospective attack vectors, security analysts can go deeper into the data using search queries, visualizations, and other analytics tools. Analysts can use these technologies to obtain the data they need to fix the problem and stop it from happening again.
Using protocol intelligence to boost network security: Organizations can improve their network security by using protocol intelligence to gain insights into network behavior, identify potential weak points, and swiftly identify assaults. Security teams can utilize this information to establish additional security controls, harden devices, and change network configurations as preventative measures. Additionally, protocol intelligence supports companies in upholding legal and regulatory compliance while protecting the privacy and security of their data.

Protocol Intelligence dashboards
This section will highlight the Protocol Centre and Traffic Size Analysis, along with specific dashboards for DNS, SSL, and Email activity and search. These dashboards offer granular visibility into different protocols and traffic patterns, aiding in the identification and analysis of potential security threats.
Protocol Center
The Protocol Center Dashboard gives a summary of network protocol data that is important for security, enabling analysts to keep an eye on and research network behavior across different protocols. The searches on the dashboard display the results based on the time selected using the dashboard time picker.

Important indices for the previous 48 hours, metrics that are pertinent to the dashboard sources are shown. At the dashboard’s top, key indicators serve as summaries of information. Protocol Activity, Long Lived Connections, Stream Connections, Encrypted Connections, and Total Bytes are some of the important metrics shown.
Connections By Protocol Shows the total number of protocol connections over time, organized by protocol. The connection distribution by protocol displays the most often used protocols in a given context, including HTTP/SSL and email protocols. An exploited protocol could display an unusually high number of connections for the service it offers.
Protocol Usage shows the total amount of protocol traffic, sorted by protocol over time and displayed in bytes. The bandwidth used by each protocol will be consistent when compared to the total network traffic. A protocol that has been exploited might show an out-of-proportion rise in traffic.

Top Sources for Connection The top 10 hosts in terms of the volume of protocol traffic sent and received over time are shown. A host that shows a lot of connection activity could be overloaded, having problems, or showing suspicious activities. Drilldown searches on the chosen source IP and reroutes the page to the Traffic Search panel.
Application For Well-Known Ports shows the total amount of protocol traffic over time, organized by ports smaller than
