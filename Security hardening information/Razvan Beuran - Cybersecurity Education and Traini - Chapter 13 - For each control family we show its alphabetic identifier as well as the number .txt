For instance, the Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity (SC-8) base control includes five control enhancements, as shown in Table 6.15, together with their identifiers and descriptions.Table 6.15Overview of the controls enhancements for the Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity base control in the Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations guidelineIdNameControl enhancement descriptionSC-8(1)Cryptographic ProtectionImplement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; and/or detect changes to information during transmissionSC-8(2)Pre- and Post-Transmission handlingmaintain the confidentiality and/or integrity of information during preparation for transmission and during receptionSC-8(3)Cryptographic Protection for message externalsImplement cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals unless otherwise protected by alternative physical controlsSC-8(4)Conceal or Randomize CommunicationsImplement cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize communication patterns unless otherwise protected by alternative physical controlsSC-8(5)Protected Distribution SystemImplement a protected distribution system to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; and/or detect changes to information during transmission

6.3.3 Defense Training ToolsDefense training relies on several tools and utilities for accomplishing the technical tasks related to the various defense actions that are required to safeguard a system. For instance, the Kali Linux distribution makes available several related meta installation packages that are organized based on the CSF functions discussed in Sect. 6.3.2.
