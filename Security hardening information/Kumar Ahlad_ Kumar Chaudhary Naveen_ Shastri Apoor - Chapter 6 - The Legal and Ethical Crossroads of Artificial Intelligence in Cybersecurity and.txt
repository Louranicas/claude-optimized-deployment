6.1 Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a noteworthy role in developing solutions for cybersecurity along with improving the security of areas like the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive networks, and critical infrastructure. The rate of change in the capabilities of AI is accelerating and is increasingly impacting every sector of society. As AI systems’ transformative impact is evident in everyday life, the potential for criminal use is rising. While harnessing AI to protect our valuable assets, such as sensitive personal information, digital and physical infrastructure we come across a multitude of discrepancies. Algorithmic bias culminates into discriminatory results if the data used in training the model is biased. Fairness-aware modeling and disparate impact analysis prove to be two substantial approaches in mitigating any algorithmic bias to facilitate fairness and equality.
Transparency is a foundational aspect of building trust in AI technologies. It provides a look into the operational processes of AI in its decision-making capabilities. While taking into consideration the importance of transparency with respect to the ethical and legal landscape, we encounter a conflict when organizations are hesitant toward providing proprietary details. Aligning the motive of protecting proprietary information whilst simultaneously ensuring transparency is a challenging task.
Furthermore, we come across concerns regarding data privacy. AI utilizes extensive data over which it is trained for better performance purposes. This data might include personal information which if exploited can account to extreme financial, reputational or security damages. On one side of the coin, AI can be utilized to enhance cybersecurity capabilities in cyber threat intelligence, malware analysis, and crime detection but on the flip side, the compliance to data protection regulations namely General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules under the IT Act is just as crucial. The use and control of AI in India have been open to debate, with reports such as the Responsible AI Report identifying principles for responsible development of AI. Instead of breeding in specific AI laws, the Indian government adopts governance using legislation made for privacy protection law, data omission statute, intellectual property right, and cybersecurity. This method is in line with the ICT policies and principles of “Digital India” initiative.
Ultimately, we arrive at the concept of liability. When pervasive threats strike, the primary question arising is, “Who needs to be held accountable for the actions taken by an AI?.” AI made decisions are highly controversial in connection with ethical boundaries and need to be reviewed with utmost precaution to maintain a responsible cyberspace. This chapter acknowledges the lack of a comprehensive ethical and legal framework and aids in policymaking to help resolution of existing enforcement gaps as well as provide legal solutions to the question of protecting data and privacy in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technology in the Cybersecurity domain.
This chapter emphasizes the ethical and legal issues of deploying AI in cybersecurity and then discusses the role of AI in maintaining critical infrastructure that could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. The authors then argue that AI is better than conventional cybersecurity solutions. This chapter suggests the need for an ethical framework and global regulations for issues created by such deployments like algorithmic bias and possibility of job threats to human employees because of AI. It dives into AI’s interaction with both the law and ethics, such as the Citizenship via Investment program, revealing the possible bias supporting its indirect use by revealing the false positives preventing the approval of citizenship, as well as the privacy implications and proposes possible fixes by instilling mechanisms such as data minimization and encryption. This chapter highlights the malicious utilization of AI and how sophisticated the attacks are and suggests that we need frameworks of cooperation among the different stakeholders. Another paper speaks of incorporating accountability and ethics into legal structures to form responsible AI governance. One of the papers on the IoT calls for a holistic legal framework. Also in this slot, a piece compares data-protection laws across the globe and notes that we need a new ethical framework for AI regulation, expressed through a holistic AI regulation.
The purpose of compiling this document is to analyze and add the ethical, legal, and regulatory implications posed by AI. Privacy concerns, inadequate International regulatory framework, algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and other multifaceted issues are the perspectives of the literature survey. It aims to harmonize the ethical and effective use of AI under a global regulatory framework.
The core concept of artificial intelligence digital forensics involves the utilization of AI algorithms to carry out automated analysis of cyber-physical and digital systems for legal reviews. With the aid of AI, forensic teams are able to accurately detect, classify, and comprehend patterns and irregularities within extensive data sets that encompass digital evidence. Through the integration of machine learning and predictive analysis, AI has the capability to provide indispensable insights that can greatly contribute to digital investigations and the combat against cybercrimes.


6.2 Literature Survey
The author S. Zeadally et al. explored various AI techniques such as deep learning, machine learning (ML), natural language processing and ML algorithms for developing solutions for cybersecurity. The research highlighted the very important concerns of privacy of the data that is collected by Internet-connected devices like smart watches, and smart home devices. A large amount of data is collected by these devices, which could be misused by the threat actors. Privacy protection of data being gathered and processed is one of the major concerns about artificial intelligence integration into cybersecurity. Much as these are important frameworks for this purpose, GDPR and IT Act’s provisions on data privacy. The legislation imposes stringent guidelines on data collection, processing, and retention to ensure that individuals’ right to privacy is respected. Nonetheless, Zeadally et al. observed that these legal frameworks are often outrun by the fast-pacing IoT and AI technologies resulting in enforcement gaps and accountability shortfalls. When deploying AI in cybersecurity ethical considerations including algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability must be considered. The focus then shifts toward the use of AI in protecting critical infrastructure of oil, gas, defense, electricity, and nuclear sectors that are crucial for social and national security. Conventional cybersecurity solutions are inadequate in keeping up with the complexities of modern infrastructure; this has led to the emergence of new solutions that use artificial intelligence techniques for the prediction of faults, classification of anomalies, dynamic access control, logic-based authorization, and self-healing mechanisms (Zeadally et al., 2020).
The authors Mansoori et al. urged the creation and adherence to an ethical framework for conducting AI and ML research in the cybersecurity realm, as well as established guidelines and frameworks for data privacy and protection. Algorithmic bias is pointed out as a problem that can lead to discriminatory procedures in cybersecurity systems. Dyson advocated for two possible corrective actions: fairness-aware modeling (so that the sample-space is less likely to be unwittingly biased), and disparate impact analysis. One of the concerns with AI and ML is ethics, whose automation capabilities may lead to job threat. Liability issues such as who is responsible for decisions taken autonomously by machines these are just some of the complicated legal and regulatory problems raised by the rapid development of AI and ML. The lack of a coherent global set of regulations for AI and ML technologies is viewed as a major problem. The text urged “multi-stakeholder work to develop universal standards and regulatory guidelines” to ensure the safety, reliability, and ethical soundness of AI technologies worldwide (Al-Mansoori et al., 2023).
The authors Joseph et al. investigated the intersection of AI with the law and ethics and the program called Citizenship via Investment (CBI), an issue prompting discussions of bias, profiling, and false positives where: when bias in an AI algorithm leads to discrimination but does not constitute a civil rights violation, correlation between the decision making of AI applications and discrimination is absent. For instance, the Dutch AI scandal identified approximately 26,000 households as frauding the government, resulting in good citizens being alleged when AI detection strategies were improperly applied. It grabbed attention to the dangerousness approach adopted by the European Union’s (EU), to finally emphasize the importance of clearly defining high-risk AI systems. The evaluation concludes that AI applications ought to take a very similar pragmatic danger-based tactic: be governed by clean criminal legislation and ethical tips (Joseph and Turksen, 2022).
This increasing literature emphasized the ethical concerns surrounding the potential of AI in healthcare. Four overarching ethical issues found in the literature are: (1) the need for informed consent in the use of patient data; (2) safety and transparency in AI systems; (3) the issues of algorithmic fairness and biases; and (4) the defense against a breach in data privacy. It politely glossed over the fact that the topic of whether AI systems are proper legal persons is currently a highly contested issue in legal theory and practice. According to literature, algorithmic transparency is troubled by limited possibilities. Among considerable ethical concerns argued in the literature is the difficulty of identifying liability in AI decision-making. AI systems are “opaque,” and not only do these present obstacles to thoughtful review but raises questions about responsibility (Nithesh et al., 2022).
The review identified two key ethical issues arising from the unprecedented quantities of personal information analyzed by machine learning and AI in cybersecurity: (1) The potential neglect or unconscious perpetuation of privacy, especially if the algorithms behind cybersecurity tools are trained on datasets with known forms of bias or demographically underrepresented groups; and (2) new forms of personal data being collected (e.g., behavioral biometrics) that people might not be aware about, and whose collection raises transparency and accountability issues. Following strict security protocols (e.g., long, complex passwords, and multi-factor authentication) on every access point can make a system safer, but your users may tire or be frustrated by the interference, which in turn will reduce productivity and user experience. One approach is data minimization, which places limits on the amount of personal data that can be collected and processed in support of a particular purpose. This is aligned with data protection regulations such as the European Union’s GDPR and its successor in the Californian market, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Encryption is another important security feature and an essential element of a layered defense against cyber threats by protecting sensitive data in both transmission and at rest. A pragmatic measure can be to appoint a data protection officer to monitor compliance with privacy (Allahrakha, 2023).
The literature’s major goal was to help us systematically think about the malicious use and abuse of AI. A key part of this literature review was the level of sophistication that exists in both AI-enabled and AI-aided attacks—from nefarious actors strategically gaming the output of algorithms to nation-states launching highly sophisticated attacks on systems. This section followed the call by exploring existing frameworks and possible avenues for improvement or development of policies that are likely to minimize risks and mitigate harms. Lastly, the review highlighted the need for greater cooperation among governments, industries, and civil society actors to increase overall preparedness and resilience to malicious use and abuse of AI (Blauth et al., 2022).
The authors Kamaruddin et al. have studied the legal ramifications of AI-based technologies in the country of Malaysia. They mentioned that the post-pandemic period was an onset for AI-based tools to be brought into action to safeguard private data and personal sensitive information alike. The use of AI technology relies on processing of personal data of EU citizens, thereby enforcing compliance to GDPR in order to fine-tune the legal framework surrounding AI. A combination of both GDPR and Malaysia’s Personal Data Protection Act becomes a holistic approach to ensure that the risk is minimized for organizations, not only for litigation and the accompanying penalties but also for organizational reputation, ensuring that stakeholders have trust in them. The authors called for a thorough review of existing legislative mechanisms following the lack of stronger suits and proposing comprehensive work that can aid in policymaking to resolve any enforcement gaps within the AI ecosystem (Kamaruddin et al., 2023).
The authors V. Poonia et al. explored the laws governing the role of AI in diverse landscapes through this chapter. While there are no such specific laws catering to AI exclusively, the author has established that the legal framework applicable aligns with the cybersecurity regulations namely GDPR and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules under the IT Act. The need for a strong legal infrastructure is highlighted while addressing issues such as transparency, algorithmic bias, and ethical dilemma to prevent any mistakes or unseen consequences. Within the field of AI governance, fulfillment is played out by incorporating accountability, transparency, and ethics into legal structures thereby promoting responsible development of AI (Poonia, 2022).
The next research paper presented the need for an integrated legal framework for the IoT using AI to enhance user experience in all spheres of daily life. This chapter addressed issues of statutes by exploring when statutory requirements should apply for lack of self-regulation or market solutions to address risks, and discussed issues of privacy in IoT devices and the need for statutory standardization of privacy requirements, considering that the US lacks certain necessary standards for privacy needs across industries. The literature review explored the issue of discrimination with the IoT, and concluded that legally protected interests should be narrowly construed. The restrictions on solicitation and use of sensitive personal information should be a part of this effort to curb potential harms and protect the rights of consumers. Additionally, the review explained that some interests relating to transparency in algorithmic decision-making should be balanced against the market interests and consumer fairness interests (Tschider, 2018).
The authors Alic explored the legislative issues of data protection and cybersecurity in AI across the European Union (EU), United States (US), and China. It discusses how individual regions approach cyber policy in relation to AI, and seeks to identify similarities and differences to establish an ethical, global framework to regulate AI. While the GDPR is praised as an example of the Euros considering that AI should serve humanity’s interests. It seems to be a response to the criticism that the bloc should invest more to stay competitive with innovators. This chapter outlined the effect of the USA Patriot Act on records control, and emphasized national protection and customer safety as pinnacle priorities. The review commended China for implementing strong educational measures in cybersecurity and adopting the Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China (CSL), it criticized China for not explicitly providing for a right to data protection as part of its law-making instruments (read: explicitly part of the CSL). It pointed out that there are difficulties in the legal and policy frameworks keeping up with AI innovation, that individual countries tend to emphasize national frameworks, and the need for global AI governance to be more thoroughly clarified (Alic, 2021).
The authors F. Casino et al. suggested that unraveling malicious activities can be quite challenging especially when dealing with the vulnerabilities in contracts. Identifying and preventing actions adds another layer of complexity. The field of forensics faces difficulties in handling datasets requiring advanced techniques for effective analysis. Retrieving evidence from devices within distributed file systems and databases proves to be a significant undertaking. Security concerns and anti-forensic methods further compound these challenges. With the rise of IoT, a new frontier emerges, bringing along a set of security challenges that necessitate standardized forensics procedures and real-time investigations due to enhanced security features. Addressing these intricacies requires collaboration and interdisciplinary research in forensics emphasizing the importance of approaches, for adaptable tool utilization (Casino et al., 2022).
The authors A. Jarrett et al. underlined that digital investigation encircles huge amounts of data and time constraints; hence the importance of AI and automation in digital forensics is crucial. They stressed on impacts and challenges that emerge with the involvement of Al in digital forensics, benefits of advanced technological solutions for digital forensics in coping with the evolving challenges of cybercrimes, challenges of applying the appropriate technology to digital forensics, importance of equilibrium between advanced technology and digital forensics for reaching efficient and accurate digital forensic outcomes (Jarrett et al., 2021).
The deepfake impersonation scam targeting the Hong Kong company acts as a pointer to the fast-growing menace from advanced AI technology. Scammers convinced an employee to allow a huge $25 million financial transfer with a very realistic digital avatar of the CFO. This is how deepfakes are giving new life to social engineering attacks against organizations. The incident can only be taken to full comprehension by drilling down to the technical details of deepfaked video creation, the company’s security measures and employee training, and the greater implications for society from this type of technology (Sankaran, 2024).
The case also throws up some important legal loopholes, since current laws may not be prepared to deal with crimes related to deepfakes. The admissibility of the evidence, jurisdiction, and definition of identity in this digital age are a few of the broad concerns. Most importantly, this case raises the need for international cooperation in prosecuting trans border cybercrimes. With the rapid evolution of the technology of deepfakes, the legal infrastructure will have to evolve to protect citizens and organizations from exploitation. (Incode Technologies, 2024).
Many new and great advancements have come out with the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence, but so have new challenges related to cybersecurity and forensics. A very relevant case study, one that will prove it, is the AI-driven voice cloning scam in Delhi-NCR, India. One such case was that of a resident of Noida. She received a distress call from a boy whom she thought was her son, asking for Rs. 60,000 in an urgent tone. Though so convincing, the voice was an artificially intelligent-aided cloned imitation. The case exemplifies exactly AI’s dual-use dilemma: while it can power innovation and convenience, it can equally well facilitate very sophisticated frauds (Zoya et al., 2022).
The application of AI in voice cloning for cybercrime purposes is a great leap into the modus operandi of the criminals. As per the data received from NCRB, there has been a manifold rise in the cases of cybercrime in the national capital, and all of them were online financial frauds. The sophistication of AI allows scammers to copy a person’s voice with high accuracy by using only a short audio sample. According to the Machine Learning Engineer at UC Berkeley, Romit Barua, the voice cloning technology uses advanced developments in audio signal processing and neural networks that manage to closely imitate unique voice characteristics. This technology, though useful in so many domains in its legitimate applications, proves to be detrimental when used for creating fraud (Zoya et al., 2024).
Morally, AI voice cloning without consent is a serious concern, especially considering how easily any person could become a victim of this type of scam, according to the results of a survey conducted by McAfee. This is further compounded by how often people post their voices online. Another ethical dimension to this concern is the emotional and psychological impact on the victim of being manipulated into states of fear and urgency. This case of AI voice cloning fraud shows that, from a legal perspective, there is a dire need for revised cybercrime laws and strong regulatory frameworks at the very earliest. In this context, awareness and education would also be required to share information regarding these new threats with the general public and to facilitate institutes in implementing basic safeguards like checking unexpected calls through another channel and creating family code words. (Zoya et al., 2022).
The potential for AI in cybersecurity is very huge, although certain areas are relatively unexplored. Some of the key emerging areas involve automated retrieval of risk indicators—unpatched systems and attempted security breaches—information that can be used to build an early warning system. A further highly challenging task is detecting zero-day attacks, since such threats are new and hence unknown, requiring full visibility across IT environments. Predictive intelligence can, therefore, automate several routine tasks in cybersecurity; however, with current techniques, high false-positive rates prevail and AI-based advanced techniques remain to be achieved in order to refine the predictions. In addition, advanced AI methods are required for multilingual threat intelligence to have an appropriate approach to non-English threats and AI-powered cyber defenses to automate security controls for better resilience of the organization (Kaur et al., 2023).
The success of AI methods in cybersecurity depends tremendously on the quality of the data representation. Most classical flattened feature vectors often miss essential linkages existing in the data. In the future, research should turn toward alternative representations, such as trees, graphs, and tensors, that better represent the phenomena in cybersecurity. Context awareness is also a very relevant issue: the inclusion of broader context information can allow dramatically better detection of suspicious activities. Further, incremental learning and recency mining are important in the development of adaptive security models that learn from changing user and adversary behaviors and help keep AI models relevant and effective over time (Kaur et al., 2023).
Sophisticated AI techniques are needed to harness the power of these different data sources for improved cybersecurity outcomes. Integration of multiple data source sets through multi-source data analysis can provide a holistic assessment. Transparency of AI-driven decisions and explainable AI form a critical mass for gaining the trust and acceptance of stakeholders. Augmented intelligence refers to a balanced approach toward decision-making in cybersecurity, where human expertise is combined with AI. Furthermore, AI application in cybersecurity requires the development of new infrastructures, such as real-time threat intelligence platforms and updated datasets. Current datasets are significantly outdated and require new and real-time datasets that can characterize the latest cyber threats (Kaur et al., 2023).

6.3 Problem Statement
To review the existing legal and ethical challenges of AI in the cybersecurity sector, necessitating a comprehensive, globally coordinated effort to address the multifaceted issues and highlighting frameworks that ensure responsible and ethical AI development and deployment in cybersecurity.
The rapid advancement of AI in cybersecurity has presented numerous legal and ethical challenges that necessitate a comprehensive, globally coordinated effort to address. One of the primary issues is the lack of a robust legal infrastructure capable of validating the actions of AI systems in this critical field. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into cybersecurity measures, the potential for misuse and unintended consequences grows, underscoring the urgent need for effective governance frameworks. Without such frameworks, the deployment of AI in cybersecurity can lead to significant risks, including violations of privacy, biases in threat detection, and accountability gaps when AI systems malfunction or are exploited by malicious actors.
Currently, the legal landscape governing AI in cybersecurity is fragmented and insufficient to address the complex ethical dilemmas that arise. There is a clear absence of uniform regulations and standards that can guide the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies across different jurisdictions. This lack of harmonization not only hampers international cooperation but also creates loopholes that can be exploited by cybercriminals. For instance, AI algorithms used in cybersecurity can inadvertently discriminate against certain groups or perpetuate existing biases, leading to unjust outcomes. Moreover, the opacity of AI decision-making processes makes it challenging to attribute responsibility when things go wrong, complicating legal recourse, and accountability.
To mitigate these challenges, it is imperative to establish comprehensive legal frameworks that ensure AI systems in cybersecurity are developed and deployed ethically and responsibly. Such frameworks should incorporate principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability, providing clear guidelines for AI developers, policymakers, and cybersecurity professionals. International cooperation is crucial in this endeavor, as cyber threats are inherently global and require a unified response. This chapter aims to explore the current gaps in legal infrastructure, propose potential solutions, and highlight existing frameworks that can serve as models for responsible AI governance in the cybersecurity sector.


6.4 Societal Impact and Human Rights in AI
AI can play a role in cybersecurity and digital forensics in ways that create a challenging blend of legal, ethical, and technical issues; those considerations have implications for how we develop AI and its incorporation into society. On the one hand, the ever-increasing use of AI in cybersecurity has the promise of improving cyber threat detection and response capabilities. However, this shift also faces important legal challenges, most importantly in terms of liability in autonomous cybersecurity systems. AI in cybersecurity legal frameworks is changing and the tension between the need for AI to improve security and the need for accountability within existing legal frameworks is important. Recent legal developments such as the EU’s GDPR are a step toward understanding and developing new legal frameworks for the ethical issues of AI in cybersecurity. DF, Privacy, and Graphics: Larks and Owls. AI-powered tools do a better job of analyzing digital evidence than humans. Issues of privacy and data protection will become central—problems associated with opaque, unaccountable algorithmic decision-making are likely to come to the fore as AI is woven deeper and deeper into forensic practice. The key to finding the right ethical balance lies in clear rules regarding how AIs must be used.
The integration of AI into the fields of cybersecurity and digital forensics will spill over into social contexts as well. Scholars caution against blurring the line between counterterrorism and human rights, since the use of AI for surveillance, threat assessments, and law enforcement has troubling implications for freedom and security. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) create ambiguity in AI development because they pit maintaining human rights against creating AI. This raises the important question of how to have a legal framework that is both sensitive and nimble enough to balance the needs of innovation alongside the unknowable consequences of AI in the future.


6.5 Ethical and Legal Considerations of AI in Cybersecurity
As the world moves into realms such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and governance, the applications of AI are astounding and transformative. And the future looks no less breath-taking. But as AI technologies are increasingly applied in areas that have an effect on the public interest or infringe people’s rights, ethical questions, and legal issues keep cropping up and will have to be addressed. What are the implications of using AI algorithms for personalized policing? How should the design, implementation, and use of AI fit into data-privacy frameworks and human rights norms? Can automated reasoning supplement or replace state regulation, and how will we deal with situations where the public relies on algorithmic and AI-based decisions? What guarantees can be given in areas where algorithms lack an explanation or are “black boxed”? The ethics surrounding data-collection and processing, algorithmic bias, the influence of AI on democratic norms and what constitutes transparent AI are only some of the issues that are addressed in a large literature on the ethics of AI. Figure 6.1 depicts various ethical and legal challenges of AI.



Long Description for Figure 6.1
Algorithmic Bias: Concerns regarding biased training datasets and fairness in AI systems. Job Threats: The risk of automation replacing human jobs. Malicious Use: The potential weaponization of AI for harmful purposes. Transparency: The need for clear and transparent decision-making in AI systems. Lack of Regulatory Framework: The absence of a global regulatory framework for AI development and deployment. The diagram connects these challenges around a central label, organizing them into a cohesive representation of the issues surrounding AI.

FIGURE 6.1 Ethical and legal challenges of AI.


6.5.1 Privacy Concerns in IoT and Personal Devices
Intense data collection by Internet-connected things poses severe risks to privacy. Threat actors could misuse this data. Traditional security methods, including encryption, prove inadequate in the face of evolving digital infrastructure.


6.5.2 Ethical Considerations in Cybersecurity and AI Implementation
All AI and ML research should be guided by an ethical framework, one that incorporates ideas such as informed consent, transparency, and conflict of interest. Algorithmic bias introduces discriminatory procedures, requiring fairness-aware modeling and disparate impact analysis.


6.5.3 Job Threat through Automation in AI
The core capability of the AI is “automation” which presents threats to cybersecurity professionals for the process of digitalization, reskilling, and upskilling. There are complex legal and regulatory challenges for liability responsibility for autonomous decisions through AI.


6.5.4 Legal and Ethical Issues Related to CBI Programs
The application of AI and the legal and ethical issues for CBI programs reveal the number of problems such as bias and profiling as well as false positives on discrimination hinders the inclusion of vulnerable groups, as it could be possible for AI applications used by states. Particularly, given the lack of distinct discrimination categories for visible as well as invisible minorities and migrants, states already lack precision in identifying such groups. The risk from AI application errors is further amplified by the infamous Dutch AI scandal and discrimination case.


6.5.5 Ethical Issues Relative to Implementation of AI in Healthcare
Ethical issues relative to the implementation of AI in health care include informed consent, algorithmic fairness, discrimination practices, as well as data-privacy breaches.


6.5.6 Using AI Application Technology to Shape the Future of Cybersecurity
Artificial intelligence is seen as the key technology to enhance the efficiency of cybersecurity work. Thus, norm setting ahead of time is vital, as the legal frameworks for AI remain ill-defined.


6.5.7 Strategic Trade-Offs for Cybersecurity and Privacy
Weighing cybersecurity against the right to privacy is a perennial issue as strategic trade-offs, for instance, data minimization combined with data encryption is imperative.


6.5.8 Building a Culture of Privacy for Cyber Resilience
It is vital to build a culture of privacy by undertaking privacy impact assessments and appointing data protection officers (DPOs) as well as cybersecurity officials.


6.5.9 Malicious Use and Abuse of AI in Criminal Activities
As AI technology may be abused to enhance criminal activities, new dimensions of threats require governance and global policy approaches to combat the misuse of AI. In this regard, governments, industries, and civil society need to strengthen their coordination to become more resilient to attacks launched by AI-enabled bot-based threats.


6.5.10 Compliance with GDPR in AI System in India
AI systems need to comply with the GDPR, which, besides being the legal requirement for maintaining the integrity of personal data, is also the right ethical approach to the development of AI. Transparency, for example, dictates that organizations dealing with personal data must inform data subjects about the purposes and means of processing through AI systems. Together with the principle of data minimization, which states that data processed should be no more than necessary, GDPR presents two ethical AI milestones. The right of individuals to access the data collected about themselves and, when necessary, to correct or delete related data—functions thoroughly embedded in AI ecosystems—is also safeguarded by European legislation.
In basic terms, GDPR compliance in AI entails the adoption of strong data protection measures (e.g., encryption and pseudo randomization), a clear consent to gather and use sensitive data for AI purposes, as well as algorithmic or AI-specific technical and organizational measures, all based on the GDPR requirements. AI development is successful because of technical resource pooling, organizational transparency, and sufficient protection of sensitive data gathered and misused for purely selfish ends. Consequently, having DPOs seems like a technical and organizational necessity given the growing hybridities of AI and its growing entanglements with ethics and law. With future techno-legal developments, GDPR-compliance mandates will become even more important, not just for the sake of holding AI accountable but also for trusting it, rendering it transparent and protecting privacy-related concerns.
As there is a massive use of AI in this country in government as well as private-sector operations, GDPR compliance presents some of the biggest challenges. However, clear merits of balancing legal, ethical, and privacy issues in AI technology practices are required in Malaysia. Reviewing the Existing Enforcement Mechanisms in the Legal Framework in Malaysia, an urgent and immediate need is to re-analyze existing enforcement mechanisms and address potential legal loopholes in addressing data protection and privacy.


6.5.11 Legal Framework for IoT Using AI
The potential risks and threats from IoT using AI technology, driven by the market, illustrate the absence of a legal framework for IoT security to protect people from autocratic attacks.
