Chapter: 1 - The initial approach is anomaly-based NIDS, which set up a baseline of typical network behavior, keep an eye out for anomalies, and sound an alarm when they find them. Hybrid NIDS are covered in the middle section. They integrate signature-based, anomaly-based, and specification-based techniques to offer thorough threat detection. NIDS that rely on signatures keep an eye on network activities, compare them to a database of recognized signatures, and sound an alarm if any matches are discovered [11]. The figure’s lower portion describes specification-based NIDS, which compare real behavior to predetermined criteria using network protocol and system behavior specifications to identify anomalies [12]. The chart highlights the overall efficacy of hybrid NIDS in augmenting threat detection through the integration of multiple detection methodologies.

Signature-based NIDS
IDS play a pivotal role in securing IoT ecosystems by identifying and responding to cyberattacks. Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (SIDS), a subtype relying on a database of known attack signatures, encounter distinctive challenges in the realm of IoT due to the resource limitations of IoT devices [5]. The overview of Signature-based NIDS is shown in Figure 5.
