Chapter: 1 - In this paradigm, the plant generates observable
outputs, received by the supervisor via an observation channel, and
each control command specified as a set of allowable events is generated
by the supervisor and fed to the plant via a command channel.
The plant will nondeterministically pick one event from the control
command and execute it. Unlike attacks in time-driven systems, attacks
under consideration in a DES aim to change the order of events in
specific system runs. There are two different streams of research on
cyberattacks and resilient control. The first stream is to treat each
attack as a fault that alters event orders in the system by either
removing existing events or inserting fictitious events. In this case,
research focuses firstly on how to decide the existence of an attack
in the system based on a finite number of observations, similar to
verifying diagnosability in fault diagnosis, and secondly on how to
ensure sufficient control abilities to stop the propagation of the attack
effect, e.g., by shutting down the entire system. Partial observation
and existence of uncontrollable events complicate the synthesis process.
The second stream is to develop a specific “smart” attack model that
ensures certain intuitive properties such as covertness and guaranteed
(strong or weak) damage infliction. Under such a smart attack model,

the research focuses on analyzing how the attack may affect the
closed-loop behavior, deciding whether the system is vulnerable to such
an attack, and finally computing a supervisor that is resilient to the
concerned attack. In this monograph, we will provide a detailed account
of existing state-of-the-art modeling and resiliency results associated
with smart attacks and point out challenges for future exploration.

cases and illustrate how they could be considered in a DES framework.

in this monograph and also provide future research topics that the

of existing DES cybersecurity research and some mathematical
preliminaries on DES supervisory control theory, which will be used
in the remainder of this monograph.
