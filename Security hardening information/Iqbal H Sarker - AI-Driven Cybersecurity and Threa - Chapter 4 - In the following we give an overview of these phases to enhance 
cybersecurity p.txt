2.5 Cybersecurity Life Cycle 35
2.5.1 Govern 
This govern function is essential in developing and managing the organization’s 
approach, strategy, and policy for managing cybersecurity risk. It serves as a cross-
cutting function, providing perceptions to achieve and prioritize the goals of the 
remaining ﬁve functions in the context of the organization’s mission and stakeholder expectations. For cybersecurity to be seamlessly included in the organization’s 
overall enterprise risk management strategy, governance activities are essential. Govern includes crucial elements like establishing the organizational context; developing a cybersecurity strategy; managing supply chain cybersecurity risks; 
outlining roles, responsibilities, and authorities; establishing policies, processes, and procedures; and ensuring efﬁcient oversight of the cybersecurity strategy. 
2.5.2 Identify 
This part typically involves understanding and cataloging an organization’s digital assets, e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, and people, 
as well as assessing the risks associated with them. Thus businesses become familiar with their cybersecurity environment during the identify step. Identifying vulnerabilities, categorizing data, identifying compliance requirements, and even-
tually establishing a foundational level of security are all included in this phase. Organizations can set priorities for areas for improvement and invest resources strategically by having an in-depth understanding of their cybersecurity landscape. 
2.5.3 Protect 
This protect phase of cybersecurity management, which builds on the fundamental knowledge gained during the identify phase, is typically dedicated to the proactive 
strengthening of an organization’s security posture. In this stage, businesses care-fully implement a variety of security measures to protect their valuable assets. Thus implementing security technologies like ﬁrewalls, encryption techniques, and access 
controls and the development of comprehensive security policies are all included in this phase. The main goal is to build a strong and resilient defense against potential threats, effectively mitigating the potential attack surface and reducing risks to a 
manageable level. The conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of information are all preserved through the use of protection mechanisms that are tactically designed against unauthorized access.

2.5.4 Detect 
In reality, security incidents can occur despite the preventive measures. Detect 
usually enables the quick identiﬁcation and investigation of anomalies indications of 
compromise and other potentially harmful cybersecurity events that might indicate 
the occurrence of cybersecurity attacks and incidents. Thus, a strong cybersecurity 
strategy must include the detect phase, which concentrates on the implementation 
of monitoring and detection technologies to ﬁnd and analyze possible cybersecurity 
attacks and compromises. Advanced technologies like intrusion detection systems 
(IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools are frequently 
used in these systems. These tools are essential for assisting businesses in quickly 
identifying any suspicious or malicious activities in real time. 
2.5.5 Respond 
The response phase becomes the focus of cybersecurity activities once a security 
incident is detected. This stage involves developing and executing an effective 
incident response strategy that speciﬁes the precise steps to be followed to swiftly 
resolve and mitigate current issues. An effective security incident response is 
essential because this contributes not only to mitigating the consequences but also to 
avoiding further damage. Overall, this function’s outcomes include communication, 
reporting, incident management, analysis, and mitigation. Therefore, a strong and 
rapid response is critically important to preserve security resilience and business 
continuity. 
2.5.6 Recover 
Following a security event, the recovery phase assumes primary responsibility and 
focuses on the process of returning affected systems and services to their typical, 
operational state. Data restoration, system patching, and post-incident analysis are 
all included in this phase. In addition to ensuring business continuity, the goal 
is to gain insightful information from the incident, identify lessons learned, and 
pinpoint opportunities for improvement. It is essential to adopt a proactive learning 
and improvement approach to enhancing future security measures and boosting an 
organization’s overall cybersecurity resilience. Overall, this phase emphasizes the 
prompt return to regular activities to mitigate the adverse impacts of cybersecurity 
incidents and to enable effective communication during the recovery period. 
Figure 2.4 illustrates the mutual dependence of all the procedures covered above 
as a wheel. Each of these tasks is intricately connected to the others, demonstrating 
how they are interdependent. These phases, when implemented in a continuous

cycle, provide a structured framework for organizations to assess and improve their 
cybersecurity posture, adapt to emerging threats, and protect their critical assets and 
data. 
2.6 Discussion and Lessons Learned 
We have explored the essentials of cybersecurity background knowledge in this chapter, focusing speciﬁcally on terminologies; attack frameworks, such as MITRE ATT&CK; the cyber kill chain; as well as cybersecurity life cycle. By exploring 
these topics comprehensively, we gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape 
of cybersecurity. This chapter established a solid foundation by exploring these fundamental cybersecurity terminologies, including cybersecurity and relevant 
emerging technologies associated with AI. For effective communication and col-
laboration among cybersecurity practitioners, this was critical. Deﬁning terms such as threat, vulnerability, risk, teaming, and relevant emerging technologies together 
laid the groundwork for effective communication in cybersecurity, which eventually 
provided a common knowledge and language within this context. Collaboration and information exchange across teams and organizations can be facilitated by a 
common language explored in this chapter. 
A discussion then shifted to attack frameworks such as cyber kill chain and 
MITRE 
ATT&CK, a robust knowledge base that identiﬁes the tactics and techniques 
used by cyber adversaries. A granular view of adversarial tactics and techniques is 
provided by MITRE’s ATT&CK framework. In our discussion, we also highlighted its role in threat intelligence, red teaming, and blue teaming, offering a solid 
foundation for enhancing cyber defense strategies. Cyber kill chains provide a 
roadmap for understanding and countering cyber threats with their seven stages, from reconnaissance to actions. A discussion of the kill chain highlighted the 
dynamic nature of cyber threats and the need for multilayered defenses. Our analysis 
highlighted the importance of disrupting attacks at various stages and implementing proactive measures to thwart adversaries before they accomplish their goals. A 
structured approach to managing and improving an organization’s cybersecurity 
posture was examined in the cybersecurity life cycle. The iterative nature of the process is highlighted in our discussion, emphasizing continuous monitoring, 
assessment, and adaptation to threats that change over time. 
A crucial lesson learned from the chapter is the imperative to integrate the 
acquired 
knowledge. Through the integration of terminologies, MITRE ATT&CK, 
the cyber kill chain, and the cybersecurity life cycle, we get a holistic view of 
cybersecurity. Combining terminologies, insights from ATT&CK, and the struc-tured approach of the kill chain and life cycle, cybersecurity professionals can create 
a comprehensive defense strategy. This combination allows for a more adaptive and 
agile response to threats as they evolve. By adopting the frameworks discussed, organizations can adopt a proactive defense approach. To reduce the likelihood 
of successful compromises, security teams can leverage MITRE ATT&CK and
