Search (Endpoint Domain):

Scenario: A specific security incident that was reported on an endpoint requires an investigation by JIT Inc.
How It Helps: JIT Inc. can perform in-depth investigations into particular endpoint-related issues thanks to the comprehensive search capabilities provided by the Search dashboard within the endpoint domain. This is necessary for forensic examination and comprehending the extent of an occurrence.

Implementation and Analysis

Continuous Monitoring and Alerting: To facilitate prompt detection and notification of possible threats, JIT Inc. uses these dashboards for continuous monitoring of endpoint security and health.
Forensics and incident investigation: Using these dashboards, JIT Inc. can conduct in-depth analysis in the case of a security incident, assisting with efficient forensic investigation and incident resolution.
Endpoint Security Compliance and Management: By using these dashboards for routine monitoring and analysis, JIT Inc. can make sure that its endpoints are safe and in compliance with both internal and external regulations.

The endpoint domain dashboards in Splunk ES are extremely helpful to JIT Inc. in ensuring strong endpoint security. Through the use of these technologies, JIT Inc. is able to protect its network from a variety of cyber threats by efficiently managing the health of their endpoints, keeping an eye out for threats, and responding quickly to endpoint-related security problems.
Network Domain
In this field, data regarding network traffic is gathered and analyzed from hardware like firewalls, routers, network-based intrusion detection systems, network vulnerability scanners, proxy servers, and hosts. The use of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), secure network topologies, and encryption protocols are examples of network security methods. Organizations can find anomalies, spot potential risks, and look into security issues by monitoring network traffic.
Protecting an organization’s network infrastructure and linked devices from attacks and vulnerabilities is the core goal of network domain security. Network security experts must act fast and adhere to the proper response processes when intrusion detection systems (IDS) discover suspicious activity.
Key components of ES in the access domain include:

Suspicious activity spotted by intrusion detection systems: Intrusion detection systems that pick up on questionable activities: If your IDS notices any suspicious or malicious activity, look into the matter right away. This can entail studying traffic patterns, looking at logs, or linking occurrences. Once you’ve established the threat’s nature, take the necessary precautions to reduce it, such as blocking the originating IP address, modifying firewall settings, or isolating the impacted systems.
Vulnerabilities: Check your network frequently for vulnerabilities and make sure your systems and software are patched with the most recent updates. The process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities ought to be ongoing. Implement a reliable patch management procedure to guarantee that vulnerabilities are fixed quickly, reducing the risk of exploitation.
Unusual ports being opened: Keep an eye out for unauthorized or unexpected port openings on your network devices since they may indicate a compromised system or an intrusion attempt. Firewalls should be set up to block unused ports and limit incoming and outgoing traffic to the bare minimum required for your company’s activities. To maintain security, evaluate and update firewall rules frequently.
Unusual DNS activity Keep an eye out for any odd behavior in the DNS traffic, such as a high volume of requests, unexpected domain lookups, or connections to known malicious sites. Put DNS security mechanisms in place, such as DNS filtering, DNSSEC, or DNS sinkholes, to stop attackers from abusing DNS. Perform an investigation into any odd DNS activity to see if it points to a more serious security problem, such as data exfiltration or command and control communication, or malware infection.
Port scanning: Attackers employ port scanning to find open ports and possibly risky services on network devices. To identify and stop attempts at port scanning, implement network intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS). Utilize network segmentation to further limit the reach of potential assaults and impose access restrictions on delicate systems.

In conclusion, a proactive and comprehensive strategy that incorporates ongoing monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response is needed for network domain security. Organizations may efficiently detect and respond to suspicious activity by having strong security controls and procedures, reducing the likelihood of security incidents and breaches.
Network Domain Areas
This section will outline the use of dashboards like Network Traffic Tracking, Network Intrusion Tracking, Vulnerability Tracking, Web Traffic Tracking, Network Changes Tracking, and the Port and Protocol Tracking. These dashboards facilitate in-depth network monitoring, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and tracking changes in network traffic and protocols to maintain robust network security.
Network Traffic
The Traffic Center dashboard offers information on the general patterns of network traffic, assisting in the detection of trends and potential security problems. It is possible to do more specific, ad hoc studies of network data using the Traffic Search dashboard. Both dashboards provide several options to help you narrow down the information shown and locate certain incidents or problems.



Figure 8.11: Traffic Center Dashboard
Traffic Center Dashboard:

Key Indicators: Provides an overview of relevant metrics for the past 48 hours to quickly assess the network traffic situation.
Traffic Over Time by Action: Shows network traffic based on firewall rule actions, with drilldowns leading to the Traffic Search dashboard for more detailed investigations.
Traffic Over Time By Protocol: Displays the number of events per day for a specified protocol, with drilldowns leading to the Traffic Search dashboard for more detailed investigations.
Top Sources: Highlights the top sources of total traffic volume, with a sparkline representing peak event matches. Drilldowns open the Traffic Search dashboard for further investigation.
Scanning Activity (Many Systems): Displays network activity from port or vulnerability scanners, helping to identify unauthorized instances of these scanners. Drilldowns lead to the Traffic Search dashboard for further investigation.

Traffic Search Dashboard:
Drilldown searches from the Traffic Center dashboard panels typically end up on the Traffic Search dashboard, which is made for ad-hoc network data searching.
Security teams may monitor network traffic patterns and immediately spot potential security vulnerabilities by using these dashboards and their corresponding filters, enabling a more effective response to attacks and incidents.
Network Intrusion
The dashboard for the intrusion center gives a thorough overview of network intrusion events gathered from intrusion detection and prevention systems (IPS) devices. The dashboard helps with IDS activity analysis and reporting, allowing you to see trends in the frequency and intensity of IDS occurrences.

To refine the displayed events, you can use the following filters:

IDS Type: Filter events based on a specific type of IDS.
IDS Category: Filter events matching vendor-defined categories.
Severity: Filter events based on their severity.
Business Unit: Filter events based on a group or department classification for the identity.
Category: Filter events based on the categories to which the host belongs.
Time Range: Select a time range for the displayed events.

The dashboard contains the following panels:

Key Indicators: Displays summary information and metrics relevant to the dashboard sources over the past 48 hours.
Attacks Over Time By Severity: Shows the top attacks over time, categorized by severity. Drilling down opens the Intrusion Search dashboard, searching on the selected severity and time range.
Top Attacks: Displays the top attacks by count and signature. Drilling down opens the Intrusion Search dashboard, searching on the selected signature.
Scanning Activity (Many Attacks): Shows source IPs with a pattern of attacks. Drilling down opens the Intrusion Search dashboard, searching on the selected source IP and time range.
