This incident underscores that even with robust internal security, vulnerabilities in partner systems can lead to significant data breaches.11

Supply Chain Cyber Risk
Cyber risk is an operational risk to information and technology assets, affecting confidentiality, availability, or integrity. It involves malicious electronic events causing business disruption and monetary loss. Cyber risks can affect both digital and physical assets and arise from internal or external vulnerabilities. These risks can be classified by their source (e.g., malicious actors, external organisations, non-malicious actors), areas of vulnerability (e.g., external partners’ weaknesses), or specific targets (e.g., information systems, electronic devices, unwitting individuals).
Understanding these terms is crucial for managing cyber risks in supply chains. Risks can arise from mismanagement of information networks, leading to data loss, intellectual property theft, or operational disruptions. This aspect of cyber risk is often confused with information risk, but they are not the same. Cyber risks cover a broader range of threats to both physical and digital assets. A cyber attacker is an individual or entity that perpetrates an attack. While cyber attackers are a common source of cyber risks, simple mismanagement of information and technologies can also pose risks. Cybersecurity refers to the technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect data, networks, and other assets from attacks, damage, or unauthorised access.
Supply chain cyber risks are an emerging threat that organisations are beginning to understand. A critical mistake is treating cyber risks like any other business risk. Traditional risk management focuses on discrete events, but cyber risks are constantly evolving. Thus, cyber risk management must be evolutionary, with continuous improvement of mitigation techniques.
A health analogy is apt: just as good hygiene minimises infection risk but doesn’t guarantee health, companies need both good structures and constant adaptation to new threats. Misunderstanding cyber risks makes identifying vulnerabilities and predicting targets difficult. Attackers may not have clear targets until they gain entry, complicating the assignment of responsibility for defence. Often, organisations delegate cybersecurity to IT or legal departments due to this lack of clarity and this causes further problems. Understanding and managing cyber risks in supply chains require continuous adaptation and strategic integration with key partners.
Cyber risks require systematic integration across stakeholders. Organisations often focus on obvious targets like customer data and intellectual property, but breaches have broader implications. Supply chain managers are largely unaware of third-party risks, which are significant. McAfee estimates cyber crime costs the global economy $445 billion annually. Cyber risk is increasingly one of the most significant business risks.12
Cyber risks can have cascading effects on supply chains, impacting reputation and financial performance. For example, Yahoo’s data breaches led Verizon to reduce Yahoo’s valuation by $350 million.13 Cyber incidents can also disrupt physical supply chains, shutting down suppliers and affecting operations. Third-party breaches are rising, with over 60% of breaches occurring through third parties.14
Most supply chain managers are unaware of third-party risks and remain company-centric in addressing them. The tendency to assign cybersecurity to IT or legal departments, often increases these vulnerabilities. Senior executives struggle with cybersecurity investment, often making siloed decisions. Joint investments in cybersecurity across the supply chain are rare.
Supply chain management lacks a systematic approach to cyber risk. Leading supply chain managers focus on collaboration with suppliers and partners to reduce risks. Although few organisations have figured out cyber supply chain security, best practices can be identified.
Engagement with industry leaders has helped identify best practices in supply chain cyber security. These practices are detailed in the following case study.
Best practices build on physical supply chain management concepts but adjust for cybersecurity risks: catalogue, map processes, clear strategy, critical systems, incident response planning, latest cyber defence systems, ongoing training and awareness, use AI and ML, unplug, treat cybersecurity like supply chain work, and active defence.
Understanding your supply chain and cataloguing your cyber inventory is the first step. Leading organisations map supply chain nodes and transitions, providing visibility into the people and processes relying on IT systems and existing risk protections. Cataloguing cyber inventory (hardware and software) is crucial for effective risk protection.
Next, create a clear cyber risk strategy addressing critical choices and directing work to improve cybersecurity. This includes identifying business-critical systems and building aggressive controls for them. A clear incident response plan is also essential.
Continuous improvement is key. Leading companies update systems with the latest defence mechanisms, collaborate cross-functionally to validate incoming equipment and systems, and ensure timely communication of risks and protections across the supply chain.
The people dimension is also vital. Ongoing training and awareness, including experiential training, are necessary. Leading organisations are intentional in digitising their supply chains, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures. These best practices help organisations manage cyber risks effectively, ensuring a secure and resilient supply chain.
New tools like AI and ML enhance capabilities but also increase cyber risk. Leading organisations assess which systems need connectivity and which can be “unplugged” without losing benefits. They use traditional supply chain management to ensure cybersecurity, treating it like any other supply chain capability. This includes using scorecards, action planning, leadership reviews, and problem-solving processes like Lean and Six Sigma. Continuous skill development and E2E strategic concepts (collaboration, integration, and synchronisation) are crucial.
The cyber risk environment is dynamic. Best practices include active defence tools like decoys and misdirection, though these have ethical and legal implications. Managers should research these thoroughly.
First principles for implementing best practices include understanding cyber risks in the supply chain. Managers often highlight a lack of understanding about cyber risks. They stress the importance of knowing the types and sources of cyber risk and using a quantitative approach to assess risks.
Cyber risks can be classified into cyber-espionage, DDoS attacks, crime ware, web app attacks, Insider misuse, miscellaneous errors, physical theft and loss, information skimmers, and point of sale intrusions.
Sources of cyber risks are less understood, but organisations can start by identifying these.
To understand supply chain cyber risks, we must assess attack vectors, tactics, and weaknesses.
Attack Vectors
Cyber risks come from strategic (targeted) or non-strategic (random) attackers. These can be state-sponsored, criminal, or general cyber attackers. Risks also come from non-malicious insiders who accidentally share sensitive data. For example, cloud computing introduces risks like data leaks and regulatory issues, not always from attackers.

Tactics
Examine how attackers breach systems or how data leaks occur. Often, weak links in supply chain partners (suppliers, distributors, retailers) are overlooked. Emerging technologies in manufacturing pose challenges due to unidentified design weaknesses. A holistic view of supply chain vulnerabilities, both technological and human, is essential. Technological risks include data manipulation and hacking, while human risks involve employee processes that enable attacks.

Weaknesses
Identify critical points in the supply chain that could be vulnerable. Both internal and external nodes in the global supply chain need scrutiny. Understanding the technological and human components helps in identifying how breaches occur.
Managing cyber risks in supply chains requires understanding the sources, methods, and critical points of vulnerability. This approach helps in developing effective strategies to mitigate these risks.
Cyber risks in supply chains can be categorised by what is at risk. Four main processes are especially vulnerable: managing information about demand, physical flow of goods, financial flows, and order management. Specific sub-processes like purchasing, supplier management, order management, inventory monitoring, manufacturing control, and financial payments are particularly at risk. Networks, computers, and devices used in these processes are susceptible to attacks like password sniffing, spoofing, denial of service, and hacking.
Physical assets in the supply chain can also be compromised. For example, attackers may target products with technology components. RFIDs in global supply chains are vulnerable to eavesdropping, unauthorised tracking, and tampering. The global nature of production adds complexity, with physical components often made in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and software development outsourced to countries like India and Ukraine. Mismanagement of these global suppliers can increase cyber risks.
Managers should categorise cyber risks to secure supply chains. New risks, such as those from e-marketplaces, include ensuring member legitimacy, data security, and accurate information. Emerging threats like document forgery, counterfeiting, and corporate identity theft are challenging to assess due to limited data. These risks can impact physical assets, cargo, and human resources.
Despite the difficulty in quantifying cyber risks, a systematic approach is essential. Managers must continuously adapt to evolving threats and integrate cybersecurity with key partners to protect supply chains effectively.
Effective risk management relies on assessing potential impacts. For cyber risks, this is crucial as they can have widespread effects. Most managers use a qualitative approach, like colour-coded scales, which is problematic for unique and complex risks. A quantitative approach is more accurate for assessing cyber risks.
Qualitative methods add ambiguity. Terms like “high risk” can mean different things to different people. For example, asking a group to estimate the likelihood of a “high risk” event can yield a wide range of answers, causing confusion. Similarly, “high impact” can mean anything from $10,000 to $10 billion in losses.
Assigning numbers to probabilities and expected losses, even in ranges, brings clarity. This quantitative approach can be managed using tools like Monte Carlo simulations in Excel. These simulations can quickly provide a range of expected losses, aligning with a company’s risk tolerance.
Once probabilities and losses are assigned, the process is straightforward. Different groups within the organisation can complete this in less than half a day. The output can then be compared to the company’s risk tolerance.
Understanding and managing cyber risks in supply chains require a strategic, quantitative approach. This ensures clarity and accuracy, helping organisations protect their operations and maintain resilience.
Critical business systems include proprietary information and devices crucial to business success. Risk management of critical business systems is crucial. Manage these systems aggressively and where necessary disconnect from the internet. Avoid IoT, cloud computing, AI, and ML where risk is too high. Use a small, skilled team over automated solutions. Mandate immediate software upgrades. Hold weekly cyber training. Implement multi-step password verification. Deploy advanced defence systems like trip wire detection and air gaps. Review cyber supply chain maps monthly. Understand and identify sources of cyber risk. Use a quantitative approach to assess risks.
Develop a cyber risk management strategy: A clear strategy is essential. Strategies may focus on strengthening security perimeters or building resilience to respond to breaches. Organisations must choose based on industry, product type, risk exposure, and tolerance.
Effective cyber risk management in supply chains requires continuous monitoring, aggressive management of critical systems, and a clear, adaptable strategy. This approach ensures supply chains remain secure and resilient.
Assume one device in the supply chain is always breached. Use a mix of preventive and resilience strategies. Cyber risk mitigation can follow existing frameworks like ISO 27001, ITIL, and NIST.
Cyber risk management frameworks: Numerous frameworks exist, including ASD, COBIT, HISO, NIST, CCPA, EU GDPR, ISO 27001, NZISM, CIS, HIPAA, ITIL, and PCI DSS.
Documentation and certifications are available online. Supply chain managers can use these frameworks to develop a holistic cybersecurity strategy. The NIST Framework is widely used for cyber risk management. It is a voluntary framework with standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks. Created to protect critical infrastructure and sectors vital to the economy and national security, it provides a common language for discussing cyber risk. This allows stakeholders to adapt the framework to their specific technologies, lifecycle phases, and sectors, ensuring everyone is aligned. The framework includes implementation tiers to benchmark an organisation’s prevention and reaction capabilities, promoting a risk-based, outcome-focused approach.
The NIST Framework details five foundational functions of cybersecurity risk management: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. Identify is crucial to establish an understanding of cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities. Protect is important to develop and implement safeguards to secure critical infrastructure services. Detect is vital to develop the ability to identify cybersecurity events. Respond implores us to take action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents. Recover encourages us to plan for resilience and restoration of impaired capabilities or services.
The NIST Framework is one of several models available for companies to build their cybersecurity strategy. Supply chain managers can adopt or adapt these frameworks as needed. However, developing a culture that supports the chosen risk mitigation strategy is crucial.
An organisation’s culture, influenced by norms of behaviour and attitudes, is key to achieving a low-risk cyber supply system. This culture must be developed across the entire supply system, crossing company boundaries. Norms and behaviours are shaped by people systems, including rewards, rituals, promotions, compensation, communication, problem-solving, celebration, and role modelling. A few key systems and activities strongly influence norms and behaviour. Some organisational cultures support strong cybersecurity capability, while others resist it. Resistant cultures have unique cultures for each functional group or supply partner, leading to distrust. Cultures promoting cybersecurity encourage seamless, collaborative, end-to-end integrated systems. Benchmark companies establish common cyber principles, values, and standards, ensuring all business functions and systems support full collaboration to achieve business goals.
Tahmasebi (2024) argues cyber resilience includes anticipatory defences, stakeholder synergy, and the cultivation of a pervasive security-centric culture. Continuous vigilance, persistent innovation, and the integration of security as a core element of corporate ethos are paramount in mitigating cyber risks. Harnessing predictive analytics, cultivating a collaborative environment for unified cyber resilience, and instilling a lasting security mindset within organisational practices help to foster cyber resilience.15
Security best practices include common standards, values, and principles across the supply system. Learning culture across boundaries is vital. Rewarding attention to detail and risk management best practices is important. Continuous improvement is needed of cultural systems. Overlapping functional and company rewards systems helps. It is important to celebrate total value improvement with supply partners. Cross-discipline, company, and functional collaboration is necessary.
An effective strategy and cultural change within and across organisations are crucial for combating supply chain cyber risks. Organisations and their key suppliers and customers should follow a consistent supply chain cyber risk management strategy, adhering to a framework. This requires a cultural change and a different mindset in managing such risks. Benchmark supply chain leaders focus on total involvement in mitigating cyber risks, recognising that all people and technologies in a cyber environment represent potential risks. A culture built around the idea that cybersecurity is a complex problem requiring the entire organisation’s effort is essential.
Integrating with key partners: Supply chain integration involves collaboration across various functions like IT, finance, and marketing, and with supply chain partners to achieve shared goals. Many companies still operate in isolation, assuming they can manage within their own walls. However, research shows that focusing only on individual processes harms overall supply chain performance, especially in cybersecurity.
Effective cybersecurity requires integration at three levels: functional, organisational, and end-to-end supply chain. This evolution in thinking helps companies better address cyber risks. Initially, companies may focus on a specific function, often IT, to manage cybersecurity. This approach is reinforced by organisational norms that channel IT-related concerns through the IT department. In some cases, the legal department handles cyber risks, viewing them as compliance issues.
These functional approaches often reflect a limited understanding of the full range of cyber risks and their impact on operations, financials, and brand perception. While starting with a functional focus can build a foundation of knowledge, it is insufficient for effective cybersecurity. A successful strategy requires a shift in mindset across the organisation.
Organisations must transition from a functional to an organisational focus, and finally to an end-to-end supply chain focus, retaining best practices at each stage. This comprehensive approach ensures that all parts of the supply chain are considered, leading to better overall performance and security.
By integrating with key partners and adopting a holistic approach, companies can better manage cyber risks and enhance supply chain security. This makes clear that this is not an IT or legal issue, but rather a serious business risk that needs to be tackled by multiple camps within and across organisations.
An expanded view of cyber risks includes multiple functions within the organisations becoming involved in formulating the strategy and dealing with the risk. Managers in organisations realise that cyber risks represent an organisation-wide concern that needs to be addressed with the participation of several units, not just the IT department. This more integrated approach could include creating a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who would be charged with coordinating cybersecurity with the CIO, COO, and other executives involved in supply chain management. It would also likely involve creating a systems security plan (SSP). An SSP details current measures for securing a company’s information systems and provides a critical starting point for improving those cybersecurity processes. While an improvement on the functional focus approach to cybersecurity, the organisational focus approach still lacks the involvement of other members of the supply chain. This leaves companies vulnerable, because the weakest link in their cybersecurity strategy may well be a third-party provider. Investment decisions related to cybersecurity are typically suboptimal without an end-to-end supply chain approach. Benchmark supply chain leaders focus on end-to-end integration to strengthen the weakest link in their supply chain and mitigate cyber risks.
End-to-end supply chain focus is key. Having a supply chain-wide view when addressing the scope of supply chain cyber risks is necessary to have an effective strategy. As with other E2E supply chain initiatives, E2E integration concerning cybersecurity rests on three core components: supply chain collaboration, end-to-end process management, and reciprocal flows of high-quality information to enable decision-making.
Supply chain collaboration is the process of working with strategic partners to identify, define, and pursue specific business opportunities that have the potential to increase overall supply chain value. In the context of supply chain cyber risk management, collaboration must start with a common understanding of the types and sources of cyber risk impacting the supply chain. Next, a quantitative assessment of probabilities and expected losses associated with relevant risks, and identification of the greatest opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed. Achieving this common understanding requires detailed mapping of the supply chain, from suppliers’ suppliers to end users. Having a supply chain-wide view when addressing the scope of supply chain cyber risks is necessary to have an effective strategy. Making informed cybersecurity decisions requires data analytics that provide real-time information for leadership and management.
End-to-end process management focuses on linking decision-making across the supply chain into a single, seamless process. Cyber risks are not just IT or legal issues but serious business risks needing a multi-departmental approach.
Decisions on E2E process management in supply chains involve evaluating trade-offs, especially in cybersecurity. Understanding threats and making informed investments are crucial. Data and information are key tools for combating cyber risks. Real-time data analytics enable proactive and predictive decision-making, focusing on relevant threats and adaptable for different users.
Leading companies use E2E strategies to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks. They segment data and define access protocols with partners, allowing quick system quarantine during breaches and better understanding of compromised areas. They also gather incident data to use advanced analytics for identifying vulnerabilities.
Integration can be internal or with partners, focusing on collaboration, E2E process management, and high-quality information flows. This supports achieving cybersecurity and creating value for stakeholders. Approaches focusing on specific functions or organisations often have awareness gaps. Few manage cyber risks systematically, though some require supplier certification. Leading organisations can differentiate by adopting comprehensive risk strategies.
Senior executives often make cybersecurity investment decisions in silos, ignoring other critical supply chain organisations. For example, a large retailer might invest heavily without considering the broader supply chain context.
This shortened chunk maintains the original structure and key points, focusing on the importance of data, best practices, and the need for E2E integration in cybersecurity. Retailers invest heavily to protect customer data due to the high cost of breaches. However, suppliers may not be as motivated, as breaches cost them less. Cyber attacks impact both the targeted firm and its supply chain. Effective cybersecurity requires collaboration within the supply chain. Without it, firms may not invest optimally.
Our analysis compared collaborative and non-collaborative cybersecurity investments and the effects of strategic versus non-strategic attackers. Lack of collaboration often leads to underinvestment with non-strategic attackers. With strategic attackers, it can cause either underinvestment or overinvestment, depending on the indirect damages.
A game theory approach, the attacker–defender model, helps determine optimal cybersecurity investments. Each firm in the supply chain is a defender, deciding how much to invest. The attacker, representing potential threats, observes these investments and targets firms accordingly. The model uses a 2x2 matrix to depict scenarios based on whether the attacker is strategic and whether defenders collaborate.
The matrix helps organisations determine optimal investment levels by considering different variables, such as sector-specific threats. This approach, commonly used in counterterrorism, has been applied to cybersecurity to enhance supply chain security.
Best practices in cyber supply chain security include high collaboration where there is better coordination and consideration of indirect costs and benefits, and greater collaboration is needed where there is likely underinvestment and risk transfer to less secure members.
By adopting these practices, organisations can improve their cybersecurity posture and protect their supply chains more effectively. A lack of collaboration in the supply chain creates gaps in awareness regarding the true costs and benefits of cybersecurity investments, skewing decisions on where and how to invest to manage cyber risks.

Non-Strategic Attacker
If attackers are non-strategic (random attacks) and firms do not collaborate, they will underinvest in cybersecurity. Non-collaborative firms consider only direct costs and benefits, ignoring significant indirect costs and benefits from their supply chain. This leads to misallocation of investments, especially when non-strategic attacks have a large potential impact on the supply chain. Over time, this underinvestment grows, increasing vulnerabilities. Adopting an end-to-end supply chain collaboration approach is critical to map out mutual benefits of a collaborative cybersecurity strategy.
The more interdependent non-collaborative firms are, the more they misallocate cybersecurity investments. This misallocation is worst when non-strategic attacks have the largest potential to affect the supply chain. Over time, lack of investment among non-collaborative firms increases vulnerabilities.

Strategic Attacker
If an attacker is strategic (focused on a particular network), non-collaborative firms increase cybersecurity investments. However, this increases risks for the supply chain by transferring risk from more secure to less secure members. Vulnerable suppliers or third-party providers become more aggressively targeted, increasing overall cyber risks.
The risk transfer problem is worse in loosely connected supply chains. Stronger firms invest to protect themselves, transferring risks to weaker firms. This can only be addressed through end-to-end supply chain collaboration.
Collaborative investment decisions: Dominant supply chain players should invest in consortiums to improve the cybersecurity of vulnerable third parties. The main challenge is defining and creating value for all partners. Managers must assess the risk to supply chain value from various cyber threats. Collaboration on cybersecurity investments can limit resource misallocation and negative consequences. Developing collaborative mechanisms for coordinating cybersecurity investments is critical for managing cyber threats.
Catalogue and identify all systems (hardware and software) that create cyber risk. Modify supply chain maps to document systems, cyber risks, people interaction, and existing protections. Develop a clear cyber risk strategy to guide efforts. Identify and aggressively manage business-critical systems. Create and follow an incident response plan. Treat cyber like supply chain work. Use supply chain tools and processes to address cyber risks. Apply end-to-end strategic concepts to manage supply chain cyber risk holistically. The latest cyber defence systems are vital. Continuously implement modern defence. By integrating practices, organisations can manage cyber risks and enhance supply chain security.
Validation: Engineering, IT, and procurement must validate incoming equipment and systems for cyber risk, covering the entire supply chain as most risks are external. Logistics, manufacturing, IT, procurement, and other supply chain disciplines must validate suppliers, external manufacturing, third-party logistics (3PLs), and other partner cyber systems interfacing with business systems.
Disconnect: Systems connected to the internet cannot be cyber-risk free. Unplug critical systems that can be managed without the internet. Industries like nuclear, information systems, and pharmaceuticals have used this practice for years on critical systems. This involves defining critical systems and using captive systems managed by dedicated experts to reduce cyber risk. As cyber risk grows, this practice is expanding to less technical industries.
Careful use AI and ML: Digitalisation of the supply chain creates new capabilities but also increases cyber risk with tools like AI and ML. These tools enhance supply chain efficiency by analysing large data sets but also expose the supply chain to higher cyber risks.
Security awareness: Annual cyber risk training is outdated. Training and awareness must be ongoing and experiential.
Acquisition integration: Validate acquisition systems before integration. This should be included in acquisition plans and resources.
Active defence: This is a tool to combat cyber risk, not hacking back. It has ethical and legal implications and should be thoroughly researched before use.
Digitalisation is transforming supply chains and increasing cyber risks. New cyber risks impact businesses through partner security weaknesses. To build robust cybersecurity in complex supply chains, internal and external stakeholders must collaborate. Managers need full involvement in understanding risks using a quantitative approach and developing strategies based on best practices. Organisations must integrate with key partners across the supply chain to manage cyber risks and decide on investments to protect it. Cyber risk in the supply chain is evolving. Supply chain leaders must incorporate cybersecurity strategies or face the consequences.
