Chapter: 5 - POWERSHELL TCP EXTRACTOR
Powershell TCP Extractor on Hak5 PayloadHub
This payload copies data to temp directory, compresses the data as a zip file, and uses powershell tcp 
socket to extract to a listener on remote machine.
The netcat listener IP address and port is configurable. This can be adapted to use an off-site machine as 
the receiver, or even the Bash Bunny itself. 
More Exfiltration Payloads for the Bash Bunny
These only illustrate a very few of the many techniques to an perform exfiltration attack with the Bash Bunny.

Getting Root on a Bash Bunny from the Serial Console
Throughout the history of personal computers, serial has been a mainstay for file transfer and console 
access. To this day it’s widely used, from headless servers to embedded microcontrollers. With the Bash 
Bunny, we’ve made it convenient as ever – without the need for a serial-to-USB converter.
With dedicated shell access from the arming mode, dropping to the Bash Bunny Linux terminal is simple 
over serial from any OS. When combined with advanced payloads, using the serial attack mode, there’s 
limitless potential for creativity with this often overlooked interface.

CONNECTING TO THE SERIAL CONSOLE FROM WINDOWS
Find the COM# from Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT) and look for USB Serial Device (COM#). 
Example: COM3
Alternatively, run the following powershell command to list ports:
[System.IO.Ports.SerialPort]::getportnames() 1
Enter COM# for serial line and 115200 for Speed. Click Open.

CONNECTING TO THE SERIAL CONSOLE FROM LINUX/MAC
1.Find the Bash Bunny device from the terminal
ls /dev/tty*" or "dmesg | grep tty 1
Usually on a Linux host, the Bash Bunny will register as either /dev/ttyUSB0 or 
/dev/ttyACM
