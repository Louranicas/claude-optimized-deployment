Chapter: 4 - The sun was shining brightly that morning, although there was a chance of showers in the late afternoon. In New Orleans, most businesses were closed so employees could vote. Kellogg and McEnery voted early and made appearances at different polling stations throughout the day.
The biggest national news story of the day came from Rochester, New York, where warrants were issued accusing Susan B. Anthony and fifteen other women of illegally trying to vote.
While in the city voting seemed to proceed well, Republican voters in many rural towns discovered the polls had been moved from scheduled locations. In Beulah, the ballot box was hidden in an abandoned fodder shed in a field several miles from town. Republican voters tracked Democrats through the woods to find it—and even when they got there many of them were not permitted to vote. Polls were located on islands in lakes, on bayous, anyplace difficult to reach. In one parish two ballot boxes were set up—all votes from newly registered voters were dropped in one box, votes from previously registered people went in the other. Only one box was opened and its votes counted.
In some areas preprinted counterfeit tickets were handed out to voters by friendly volunteers. These ballots looked exactly like legitimate ballots, bearing the correct party symbols and colors—but at least some information on them was false. Candidates were left off the ballot or their names were spelled incorrectly or listed in the wrong district or any other small change that would make a vote invalid. Voters took the ticket without bothering to check the details and deposited it in the ballot box.
Although by law people were prohibited from carrying weapons unless specifically authorized by the governor or his officials, there were numerous reports of violence and intimidation. In Livingston two Republicans who tried to vote early in the morning were shot, discouraging others from showing up. In St. Landry as many as five hundred men were “compelled to vote the Democratic ticket on pain of a repetition of the terrible massacre of 1868.” In numerous other places weapons were produced to remind Republicans how dangerous it might be for them to vote.
There was the usual ballot box stuffing. The most common method was to fold several ballots inside one legal ticket when voting. When the box was moved the ballots would separate.
None of this was unique. Both parties were aware of it, and neither of them objected. According to newly Democratic Governor Warmoth, “There never was a more peaceful, free or fair campaign and election held in the state of Louisiana. There were no riots nor disturbances of any kind anywhere in the State.”
Republican Senator Kellogg agreed, describing it as “the fullest and fairest election that ever occurred in the city, so far as immunity from violence or unjust interference was concerned.”
The polls were closed. The voting was finished. Election officials opened the boxes and started counting the votes. Tallies slowly trickled in from every district. And over the next few days and weeks, the magnitude of the fraud became clear.
It turned out both parties had laid plans to rig the election long before the first vote. Starting months earlier, Republican carpetbagger Congressman J. Hale Sypher had told election supervisors to register as many names as possible, no matter where the names came from, so that “the votes cast [in this election] should not exceed registration.” They were careful to make certain there were a sufficient number of registered voters to account for every vote counted.
Democrats had their own scheme: in the registration books a letter D was written next to numerous Black voters. It was later discovered that this was a secret instruction to Democratic supervisors, alerting them that a duplicate ballot had been issued to a white Democrat so when the Black man showed up at the poll he should not be allowed to vote.
It worked: in Cotile, for example, on election day almost two thousand legally registered Black voters were turned away from the poll.
When it came to counting votes, the result was in the hands of the ballot box holder. In theory it was simple: after the polls closed, the commissioners in each district unlocked the box and counted the ballots by hand. The results were recorded and submitted to the supervisor. In reality, it didn’t work that way: in district after district the returns were incomplete, inaccurate or just impossible to believe. Ballot boxes disappeared, or were stolen, but mostly were stuffed with fraudulent votes. One New Orleans resident appeared to have voted seventeen times. Thousands of men were deprived of the right to vote, while thousands of fraudulent ballots were deposited.
A state investigation weeks after the election concluded that in only three or four of the fifty-eight parishes in the state was the reported count based directly on the votes in the locked box—although even in those cases there was no evidence how those ballots got into the box. The Democratic supervisor of Madison Parish admitted he had taken the box with him to New Orleans. There were too many Republicans in the parish, he told investigators, so he had hidden in an apartment in the city where his friends protected him, destroyed the votes and replaced them with Democratic votes. In the town of Mooringsport, three hundred and ten registered Republicans voted, but when the box was opened there were only eighteen Republican votes. In Pointe Coupee, “460 Republican and 63 Democratic votes were cast. But after sleeping one night with the Democratic supervisor the Republican votes melted to 20.”
In some areas where ballot boxes were not sufficiently stuffed, they were taken from supervisors—who were supposed to retain possession—sometimes at gunpoint, and delivered unlocked hours later to headquarters. At least four hundred Republican votes were cast in Jefferson Parish, but the supervisor was not allowed to ride in a carriage transporting the box—and when it was opened there wasn’t a single vote for Grant or Kellogg. In some cases, boxes did not get to the proper place for several days, and no one knew where they had been in the interim.
“The Fifteenth Amendment means more than this,” the New Orleans Republican complained several days after the election. “A vote is of no use to a man unless it is honestly counted, and to give him the right to put it in a ballot box, and at the same time [give] another the right to withdraw it, or refuse to count it is to vex his ear with vain promise.”
According to the final count, Grant won the presidential election in Louisiana. But the results were so obviously corrupt that Congress wouldn’t allow the state’s delegates to participate in the electoral college vote.
Who won the gubernatorial election? It depended entirely on which ballots were accepted and counted. It was up to the Returning Board to determine whether Kellogg or McEnery would be the next governor.
And who controlled the Returning Board? Henry Warmoth.
He had given himself that power two years earlier and zealously protected it. He had the right to appoint a five-man Returning Board with complete authority to examine election returns and reject the results from any polling station, district or parish if—in their opinion—the vote had been influenced by violence or fraud. Warmoth understood how vital this law was if he was to continue controlling the political process and had beaten back several attempts to rescind it. The greatest threat had come only a month earlier and resulted in one of the most unusual events in American political history.
The reasonably good working relationship between Warmoth and Lieutenant Governor Pinchback had ended with the split of the Republican party. Whatever trust that once existed between them was gone.
The previous January the state legislature had passed modified registration and election bills curtailing the governor’s power to name his own Returning Board. Rather than vetoing it, Warmoth did nothing, knowing he had until his term ended in January 1873 to act on it. So the laws remained in limbo.
In October, the National Republican Committee invited Pinchback to speak in New York. The lieutenant governor had become one of the most respected Black politicians in the country, he’d gotten a lot of attention in the national media, and people wanted to see him in person. And Pinchback wanted to meet the party leaders. Who knew what opportunities lay ahead?
That trip attracted Warmoth’s curiosity. He invented his own reasons to go to New York and see for himself what was going on. His first day there he just happened to meet Pinchback walking on the avenue with a state senator and invited him to meet later that night at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Perhaps they might find a common ground, he suggested. Pinchback readily accepted.
But he didn’t show up. Warmoth assumed he had “fallen to the allurements of New York” and simply forgotten their meeting. The next morning, he asked the senator what had happened to the lieutenant governor. The man shrugged; he hadn’t seen him since the previous afternoon. It turned out no one had seen him. Pinchback seemingly had disappeared. A spokesman for Grant’s reelection committee hastily announced Pinchback was en route to Pittsburgh to deliver an address.
That was a lie. Warmoth got a message from a knowledgeable “friend” in the Custom House camp that something far more devious was in action. The chairman of the Custom House Republicans, US Marshal Stephen Packard, had initiated a plan to overthrow the governor while he was out of the state.
With Warmoth and Pinchback out of the state the speaker of the house would become the acting governor. Packard planned to convene the legislature, have the speaker sign the amended registration and election bills, which instantly would become law, direct the legislature to impeach the governor and other officials—especially the registrars of voters—and reorganize the Metropolitan Police force. Custom House members of the legislature had been informed of the plan and were ready to carry it out.
Pinchback had not been part of it at first. He didn’t even know about it. The speaker had agreed to it. But when he reneged at the last minute Packard contacted Pinchback, who was already in New York. Rather than meeting Warmoth as he had intended, Pinchback had secretly taken a train back to New Orleans.
A proclamation setting the whole plan in motion by convening the legislature had been printed and was awaiting Pinchback’s arrival in Amity City. It was to be telegraphed to New Orleans. It would take no more than fifteen minutes once the legislature was in session to run the bills through both houses. Several militias also were prepared to protect the coup’s participants and, if necessary, maintain the new government by force.
There also was some discussion about staging a riot, which would allow President Grant to declare martial law, guaranteeing he would carry the state in the upcoming election. It was not known how much, if any, advance notice Grant had about this attempt to overthrow the governor, but newspapers noted that his brother-in-law Casey was sent out of the state before the coup began.
Warmoth had only one hope: somehow, he had to get back to New Orleans before Pinchback got there. That seemed impossible. The lieutenant governor had a half-day head start.
But what Pinchback didn’t have were Warmoth’s contacts or his cunning. The race for control of Louisiana was on.
The chairman of the McEnery campaign committee was Major E. A. Burke, who conveniently also was the manager of the Illinois Central Railroad in New Orleans. Warmoth and Burke had a good working relationship. He sent Burke a long, detailed telegram laying out the situation. Do not let Pinchback get over the state border before me, he wired; do whatever you have to do to stop him. He then asked Burke to arrange a special car and engine to help him beat the lieutenant governor to the city.
Edward Austin Burke and Warmoth made a fine pair. Burke had arrived in New Orleans only a few years earlier, emerging from a somewhat shadowy background. He had served in the Confederate army, but there were questions about his rank; on occasion he claimed to have been a colonel. It was rumored he had added the e to his last name after arriving in New Orleans to confuse creditors he’d left in Texas. Once settled, he quickly became involved in Louisiana politics, New Orleans society and white supremacist militias. Like Warmoth, he was crafty. He weighed the consequences and picked his side: there would be great benefits for him if he saved Warmoth.
Burke ordered a locomotive and one car for the governor. He ordered all train traffic off hundreds of miles of Mississippi and Jackson track. But even at the amazing speed of forty miles an hour Warmoth wouldn’t be able to catch Pinchback. Somehow, Pinchback had to be slowed.
In desperation, the two men devised a clever plan. Burke found out what train Pinchback was on. That train had to stop briefly in Canton, Mississippi, for coal and water in the middle of the night. When the train arrived the stationmaster boarded and told the lieutenant governor there was an important dispatch waiting for him in the office. Whatever it was, it had to be handed to him in person. Pinchback left the train and went into the station. He was handed the message and without reading it, turned to rush back to the train.
The station door was locked. He couldn’t get out. No one seemed able to open it. In desperation, he climbed out the window onto the platform. Too late. The train had left without him.
He still was standing on the platform, forlorn and defeated, when Warmoth arrived the next morning. “I shall never forget the triumphant expression on his face,” Pinchback recalled. “He was standing on the front platform of his special train as it came lumbering into town. ‘Well, Governor,’ I said, ‘your lucky star is still in the ascendant.’”
“Hello, old fellow,” Warmoth greeted him, smiling broadly, “what are you doing here?” The governor then graciously asked the lieutenant governor to join him for the remainder of the trip. Pinchback accepted. It is not known what the men discussed on the ride home.
Warmoth had put together an incredible operation in only a few hours. Men were stationed all along the train route to telegraph reports of Pinchback’s progress. Had the ploy failed at that train station or if the lieutenant governor had taken a different route, an “impassible barrier” awaited him when he reached Mobile.
With Pinchback on board, the race home continued. The “meteoric flight of Governor Warmoth,” as it was reported, took only sixty-two hours to cover the seventeen hundred miles from New York to New Orleans, the fastest recorded railroad trip in history!
A master mechanic who examined the engine at the end of the journey found that the bands which held springs together had burst, and in another ten miles would have caused a “first class accident,” possibly resulting in serious injuries.
The Custom House coup had failed. Warmoth had kept control of the Returning Board. And in any other election that would have made all the difference.
Not this time, though; not in this election. The reported vote totals couldn’t be trusted and didn’t include the thousands of eligible voters who had been kept away from the polls. Both parties could make a strong argument that the other party had cheated; it was impossible to determine the actual winner.
The American electoral system hadn’t been designed to deal with this type of problem. It had been cobbled together out of tested parts from various countries, then tempered with compromise. There were elements from ancient Rome and Athens, from the methods used to select Holy Roman emperors and popes.
The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution had resulted in the largest number of people in American history being eligible to vote. Hundreds of thousands of new voters had been added to the rolls. The election of 1872 was a test of the resiliency of the system. No one had considered the possibility that the system could collapse.
When there had been unanticipated problems in the past, reasonable men had figured out how to deal with them. The presidential election of 1800 had resulted in an electoral tie and had taken six days and thirty-six votes in the House of Representatives before deals were struck and Thomas Jefferson became the president. To make sure that didn’t happen again, the Twelfth Amendment was passed to make the necessary changes in the system. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in 1824, the House finally elected John Quincy Adams—after Henry Clay, who finished fourth, gave his support to Adams in return for being named secretary of state. This election exposed the inherent dangers of having more than two competing parties in the electoral college system. There had been anecdotal stories of close or tied local elections being settled by the flip of a coin, picking a name out of a hat, bribery or even an agreement to share or rotate the office. But an acceptable solution always had been found.
Americans had gotten used to dealing with the complaints and claims that arose after every election. Louisianians expected this would be no different. One of the first lawsuits arising from this one was filed within days by Colonel Charles Lowell, postmaster of Jefferson Parish, who accused commissioners, supervisors “and all other parties on whom responsibility can be laid” of stealing his vote. At some point the poll box at the former Confederate fort of Camp Parapet had been changed, making it appear Lowell had voted against Grant, Kellogg...and himself. According to the returns, four hundred other registered Republicans in the precinct also had voted a straight Democratic ticket.
About this action, the Republican wrote, “There is serious discomfort for some people brewing.”
More than a week after the election, returns were still being delivered. In numerous cases they were far different than had been expected. Strong Republican parishes had gone for Greeley and McEnery, while marginally Democratic areas had delivered unexpectedly large majorities. It was reported, “Developments of illegal and fraudulent proceedings are being brought to light.” Republican officials remained confident, claiming they had carried the state by 30,000 votes. Democratic committee leaders were equally confident, setting their winning margin at 20,000 votes.
As the counting continued, people were relying on observers to ensure the totals were honest. It was hard to cheat with people watching. But in some cases, those observers were denied the right to watch the proceedings. A group of armed Black citizens had followed a ballot box from their polling station to the State House. Legally, they had every right to go inside to monitor the counting. But the sheriff refused to admit them, so they stood at the window outside watching the box. They stood throughout the day and night. Every few hours new, fresh watchers replaced them.
By the second week reporters also were routinely being denied access to the Mechanics Institute.
The mechanics of an election were obscure. Until Warmoth had made his fight to control it, most people were not aware there was such a body as a Returning Board. In many cases being a member of the Returning Board was considered an honorary commission. Theoretically, it had the ultimate power in an election, as the Board declared the winner; but in reality there wasn’t much to do other than confirm the reported numbers.
Two weeks after the election, the Returning Board met in Governor Warmoth’s office to examine the reported results and declare the winners. The governor had fought the legislature and set a railroad speed record to maintain control of the Board. But he had lost confidence in some of its members, so even before the Board officially convened he tried to replace them with people he believed were more loyal to him.
The consequences of that would become a life-and-death matter and eventually be settled with machine guns in the streets of New Orleans.

It was reported, “Developments of illegal and fraudulent proceedings are being brought to light.” Republican officials remained confident, claiming they had carried the state by 30,000 votes. Democratic committee leaders were equally confident, setting their winning margin at 20,000 votes.
As the counting continued, people were relying on observers to ensure the totals were honest. It was hard to cheat with people watching. But in some cases, those observers were denied the right to watch the proceedings. A group of armed Black citizens had followed a ballot box from their polling station to the State House. Legally, they had every right to go inside to monitor the counting. But the sheriff refused to admit them, so they stood at the window outside watching the box. They stood throughout the day and night. Every few hours new, fresh watchers replaced them.
By the second week reporters also were routinely being denied access to the Mechanics Institute.
The mechanics of an election were obscure. Until Warmoth had made his fight to control it, most people were not aware there was such a body as a Returning Board. In many cases being a member of the Returning Board was considered an honorary commission. Theoretically, it had the ultimate power in an election, as the Board declared the winner; but in reality there wasn’t much to do other than confirm the reported numbers.
Two weeks after the election, the Returning Board met in Governor Warmoth’s office to examine the reported results and declare the winners. The governor had fought the legislature and set a railroad speed record to maintain control of the Board. But he had lost confidence in some of its members, so even before the Board officially convened he tried to replace them with people he believed were more loyal to him.
The consequences of that would become a life-and-death matter and eventually be settled with machine guns in the streets of New Orleans.

As the counting proceeded with agonizing slowness and debate had begun over the makeup of the Returning Board, national problems diverted attention away from the State House. There were serious problems on the Mexican border: it was wide-open, and bandits and other immigrants were crossing it with impunity. Grant, who had been reelected, talked tough about sealing the border, but there was little he could actually do to close it or protect Americans. According to newspapers, reports “leaked” from government sources “in anticipation of official documents [claimed] that the President, in conference with Mexican border commissioners elicited the opinion that $100,000,000 would not more than cover the injury to American interests on the southeastern frontier...for which Mexico is directly or indirectly responsible...
“Nor less idle would it be to think of a complete military guard for the thousand or more miles of American frontier contiguous to wild stretches of Mexican territory... That public opinion in this country would sanction such a measure is by no means probable... It certainly would not pacify the border or give the desired encouragement to American commerce and industry.”
Complicating the situation, the story continued, was the weakness of the Mexican government, which was “liable to fly to pieces like the fabled jointed snakes.”
Ironically, only a few days later the Rapides Gazette for the first time raised the possibility that Louisiana’s government might collapse. There were no provisions in the state or the federal constitution that would help to deal with this situation. What happens to a state when it is impossible to determine the winner of its gubernatorial election? What happens when a sizable segment of the populace doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of a government? What happens when half of the voters refuse to accept the results of an election? Anarchy? Chaos? Government by force and fiat? The Gazette asked a question to which no one had an answer: “Can two separate governments be erected and the question of legitimacy decided by the recognition and support of one of them by the federal government?”
While it would be several decades before good losers began offering a public concession speech, many defeated politicians showed proper manners by congratulating the winner and offering no protest about the results. Not this time, though. Given the bitterness between the parties, a concession from either side seemed unlikely.
The only hope was that the Returning Board could make some sense out of the jumble of fraudulent votes and people kept away from the polls and arrive at a fair conclusion. Complicating matters, Republicans had submitted thousands of affidavits from people claiming they had been denied the right to vote and demanded those be counted as Republican votes, while Democrats contended many of those affidavits were fraudulent.
Somehow the Returning Board had to sort it all out. But the Board was a political creation, and its members had no expertise in electoral matters. They were politicians. They knew how to please voters, not count their votes.
Governor Warmoth cared little about the legal niceties. He had one objective: make sure his man, McEnery, became governor. He didn’t seem to care how. As soon as the Board assembled, the governor challenged its makeup. It was comprised of the governor, the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state and two state senators. But a law prohibited anyone running for elective office from serving on that board. Lieutenant Governor Pinchback had run for a Congressional seat, and State Senator General Thomas C. Anderson had run for reelection. Therefore, they were ineligible. But there was no legal guidance on how to replace them. The men chosen to fill those two seats would control the Board—and therefore the election. Warmoth claimed the power to select them.
As he later explained, “If the Kellogg–Grant party could have captured the Returning Board they hoped to be able to throw out enough Fusion votes, on one excuse or another, to change the result and give them victory.”
And if that happened any possibility of him being appointed to the Senate seat would disappear. So he had to make sure his men got those seats. Years later he claimed that Republicans offered that prize to him as a bribe if he dropped McEnery and supported Kellogg. They “dangled before my eyes the seat in the United States Senate which would be made vacant by the election of Senator Kellogg to the Governorship.” Naturally, he would claim, he was far too ethical to use “the power of the Returning Board...to wipe out the Greeley–McEnery majority.”
Instead, when the Board met he announced he was removing the acting secretary of state, war hero and US Marshal Francis J. Herron. He immediately appointed Colonel Jack Wharton, a loyal supporter, to that seat. Fortunately, Wharton happened to be waiting in a room nearby. He also named Colonel Frank Hatch and Durant da Ponte to the vacant seats left by Pinchback and Anderson. Both men were sworn in. That gave him total control of the Board.
Herron objected, claiming Warmoth had no right to replace him, and nominated General James Longstreet and Jacob Hawkins to fill the two open spots. The other remaining member of the Board, John Lynch, supported those nominations. Both men were sworn in. That gave Herron a majority of the five-member Board and total control of it.
Nonsense, Warmoth countered. Less than two months earlier, after a battle with the legislature, he had quietly replaced then secretary of state George Bovee with Herron. Bovee learned he had been replaced when he went to his office and found Herron—and four police officers—waiting there. The two men started brawling, and Bovee was arrested for assault and battery.
Warmoth pointed out that Herron had recognized the governor’s power to replace the secretary of state in that instance, and nothing had changed that in the previous few weeks. Now he was replacing him.
Herron responded that his appointment was legal, and he had the commission to prove it.
Not quite legal, Warmoth said. While working as a collector of taxes Herron had been accused of misappropriating $1,000, a charge that had to be resolved before he could legally become a state officer. In fact, Warmoth said, he’d loaned the man $1,400 to settle that charge before appointing him and had only recently discovered that no payment had been made. Therefore, Herron’s appointment as secretary of state was illegal. The position was vacant, allowing him to fill it with Jack Wharton.
Neither side would back down; suddenly, there were two Returning Boards.
Each side sued the other, hoping the court might be able to restore some semblance of order. Only six years earlier in Philadelphia, an enterprising man had created the first baseball scorecard, a tool that enabled observers to identify all the participants—among them Brooklyn’s first baseman, Bob “Death to Flying Things” Ferguson—and track the progress of the game. Unfortunately, there was no similar way to make sense of everything that was going on in Louisiana. Each day brought a new tactic, making the already-complex situation far more difficult to understand. It was like tying knots in knots. Events were moving so quickly that even the already-partisan newspapers couldn’t keep their readers informed. The only thing that everybody knew was obvious: nobody had the slightest idea who had won the election or, more important, which Board would determine who the next governor of Louisiana was going to be.
As this was going on, Henry Warmoth sat in the governor’s office, directing events with the skill of a seasoned railroad dispatcher, bringing lawsuits and defending against other lawsuits, trying to maintain control of the legislature, calling in favors and making promises, doing whatever was necessary for his own political survival. “The utterly unscrupulous political character of Warmoth,” wrote a New York Herald reporter, “has been shown in the fact that he flies from principle to principle and from party to party, animated by no other disposition than to retain his supremacy. At the present time he is playing the desperate game of fighting the courts of his own state, the courts of the United States, the administration at Washington and risking the possibility of a terrible riot in order to make one step further and descend from his reckless enjoyment of power to be a dignified Senator.”
Senator? Warmoth was ready for this battle. He had been seeding the system since taking office. Before he’d entered the governor’s office, the state constitution established seven district courts in New Orleans and its environs. The judges of those seven district courts were elected. The courts basically had equal powers and at times issued conflicting or contradictory rulings. The governor had little control over the judicial system. That had to change.
Warmoth couldn’t fill the benches with loyalists, so he came up with another idea. In 1870 he pushed the legislature to create a new and powerful eighth district court, one that was superior to the other seven in areas that concerned him. Within this court’s jurisdiction was the right “to entertain all proceedings...in which the right to any office...is in any way involved.”
The governor appointed his close friend Henry Dibble the first judge of the Eighth District Court.
Dibble was a fellow carpetbagger. After arriving in Louisiana, he had aligned himself with Warmoth, serving as a member of his 1868 campaign committee. He proved to be an important ally. An excellent lawyer, he successfully represented Warmoth in a series of cases that extended the governor’s control of the state’s fiscal policies. The association between the two men grew stronger as Dibble played key roles in both the administration and the reelection campaign.
It turned out, though, that Dibble had a fatal flaw, as far as Warmoth was concerned: he was honest.
For Warmoth, that meant he couldn’t be trusted.
The question of which Returning Board was legal went to Dibble’s Eighth District Court. Judge Dibble actually had been defeated in the recent election, but because no Board had been recognized to certify the returns, his replacement had not yet been allowed to replace him.
His courtroom was mobbed for the hearing. Spectators who didn’t get in “surged in great volume up and down the stairways and along the sidewalk to the post office corner.” The night before the hearing Warmoth apparently offered Dibble a lucrative position. The judge responded with a nasty note rejecting the offer.
After listening to the arguments, Dibble granted the Herron Board’s injunction against Warmoth, deciding “there was not another person besides the Governor in the state who did not believe Herron to be the Secretary of State... I hold that Herron is still secretary of state.” As there was no evidence that his successor, Wharton, had been sworn into office before the meeting began, Herron remained secretary, making the original Board the legal Board.
But Dibble went further in his decision, writing bitterly about his now former ally, “his acts have been so frequently designated as a brilliant coup d’etat, that I feel called upon to say that coup d’etat is not an American institution, it belongs to another country, where they have barricades, and where they meet to organize governments at midnight.”
On that same day, Kellogg made the impasse a federal case. He filed a suit against the Warmoth Board in Judge Edward H. Durell’s United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Judge Durell had been the Republican mayor of New Orleans during the Union occupation, and then had been appointed to the bench by Lincoln.
Warmoth’s lawyers challenged the right of the federal court to even hear the case. This is about states’ rights, they contended, and belongs in state court. Kellogg’s lawyers protested that this was really about the Fifteenth Amendment, telling Judge Durell that ten thousand Black men had been denied the right to vote. “The court should have jurisdiction for the preservation of peace and order...the constitutional guarantees and the enforcement acts passed under them require the court to take it.”
A great deal of legal bluster echoed through the courtroom, but the outcome seemed reasonably certain. Days earlier Kellogg, US Marshal Packard and Grant’s brother-in-law Casey had raced to Washington and met with the president and the attorney general. They warned that this was an attempt by Warmoth to destroy the Republican party in the state. While officially Grant stayed out of it, several private notes passed back and forth from Washington to New Orleans. Kellogg continued to plead with the president and attorney general to intervene, telling them, “This is a systematic and organized attempt...to outrage every principle of justice, to override all constitutional and legal restraints...” Fearing violence, he concluded by asking for federal troops to maintain order.
All the uncounted returns, meanwhile, sat stored in the State House. Both Kellogg and McEnery continued to insist they had won and would not be cheated out of their victory. The two men each held rallies where supporters cheered their victories and jeered their opponent. This fight isn’t for me, both candidates insisted, it’s for you. It’s you who is being cheated. Keeping supporters emotionally involved was vital.
That message was being heard. People felt it. They believed it. The differences between the two men were as wide as the gap between North and South. Louisianians’ future would be very different depending on who was declared the winner. The Republicans knew with certainty that Democrats had cheated in the election, and the Democrats knew with equal certainty that Republicans had cheated to win the election.
If men of Louisiana had once believed in the integrity of the electoral process, that was gone. The only thing that mattered was winning. Thus far it had been a battle of words, fought in courtrooms and in public speeches, but it was only a matter of time before it escalated into violence.
Minor issues that previously would have attracted little attention suddenly were magnified. A statue of Benjamin Franklin was to be erected in Lafayette Square. But to McEnery supporters Franklin was no longer a man who signed the Constitution and helped create the nation; he was simply a northerner. A carpetbagger. Unworthy of being honored in New Orleans.
Judge Dibble’s injunction had stopped Warmoth, at least temporarily, from claiming a victory. Whatever influence Warmoth once had over the judge clearly was gone. But he did not give up; all men had a price, he believed. So he tried again, sweetening his offer. He would remain governor for several more months and still had enormous resources. If Dibble stepped down immediately, he suggested, his future could be made considerably brighter. Dibble responded even more forcefully, replying, “It would be treason for me to act as you suggest.”
Warmoth had played this hand as long as he was able, but the decision of the court ended it. So while Kellogg’s supporters were celebrating their victory he played a brand-new card: voilà! The election bill passed months earlier by the legislature had sat unsigned on his desk. He took out his pen and signed it. One of the provisions of the bill abolished all previously existing Returning Boards, leaving it to the legislature to appoint a new one. By law, the Returning Board had to begin its work within ten days following the election. As the legislature was not in session, to comply with that timeline he was legally required to name the members of the new Board.
And so, he created a third Returning Board, which became known as the De Feriet Board, named after one of its members, G. De Feriet, a leading businessman.
At that moment there was a wonderful variety of available amusements in New Orleans. The St. Charles Theatre was offering The Merry Wives of Windsor, which displayed “Mr. DeBar’s rare talent as a comedian.” Three comedies, Les Domestiques, the farce Un Caprice and La Grève des Forgerons, were playing at the Opera House. And the Academy of Music was presenting the Irish comedy Shin Fance. But nothing was more entertaining—or less predictable—than the unfolding political and legal dramas taking place in the city.
Since Judge Dibble wouldn’t accept a bribe, Warmoth decided he too had to be replaced. To accomplish that, he later explained, he examined all the returns (even though they officially had not been opened), declared that Dibble had been defeated and signed an order removing him from the Eighth District Court. To replace him, he appointed judge-elect William A. Elmore. He did so, he said, to settle the confusion. If he didn’t act swiftly the “returns would be tied up six to twelve months, perhaps.”
At the same time, he also appointed the newly elected judges from the other seven courts.
The next morning, Thursday, November 21, it was reported that in the Second District Court Judge Duvigneaud had retired from the bench “with grace and politeness.” In the Third District “the same quiet manner prevailed.” In fact, the gavel was handed over peacefully in every courtroom—except in the Eighth District.
Word spread throughout the building, and people raced to the already-crowded courtroom to see the show. As soon as he assumed the bench, Judge Elmore had appointed a new sheriff, W. P. Harper, new deputy and new court clerk. Just as he finished swearing them in, Judge Dibble arrived, accompanied by the now “former” sheriff, C. S. Sauvinet.
It was a scene worthy of Molière. Judge Dibble ascended the bench, stood next to Judge Elmore and ordered the previous clerk to open the court. Then, according to observers, “Mr. Sauvinet began to cry it open but had not much got beyond ‘Oyez, oyez’ when [newly appointed] Deputy Sheriff Dick seized hold of him by his clothes and told him to stop.”
“Open the court!” Judge Dibble shouted to Sauvinet, who couldn’t do anything because Deputy Dick refused to let go of him.
Until that moment Judge Elmore had been silent. Looking directly at the new sheriff he pointed to Judge Dibble and ordered, “Come forward and arrest this man!” Deputy Dick released Sauvinet, climbed onto the bench and took hold of Judge Dibble.
More spectators pushed into the courtroom. The crowd outside the room continued to grow.
The two judges then turned on each other, threatening each other with legal actions. The decorum of the court disappeared. Finally, Judge Dibble stepped down, warning Judge Elmore that he was going directly to the State Supreme Court, where his position would be supported—and the first thing he was going to do was have Judge Elmore arrested and “committed to the Parish prison for contempt of court.”
Judge Elmore countered that he would have Judge Dibble arrested for disturbing the court.
Judge Dibble stormed out of the room, trailed by Sheriff Sauvinet, spectators clearing an aisle for the men as they left. Judge Elmore took a deep breath, gaveled the courtroom quiet and began the proceedings.
He was only minutes into the session when Judge Dibble and Sauvinet returned, pushing their way through the crowd. The State Supreme Court had issued a writ confirming Sheriff Sauvinet retained his office, Judge Dibble announced. Once again, he stepped onto the bench, then he ordered Sauvinet to adjourn the court until the situation could be unraveled.
Undeterred, Judge Elmore ordered Sheriff Harper to arrest Judge Dibble. Harper took hold of Judge Dibble and forcibly pushed and pulled him from the courtroom. Judge Dibble’s shouted threats could be heard as he was ejected. When the courtroom settled down again, Judge Elmore called a case involving an unpaid promissory note. The spectators, realizing that “the law had got back to its original drone, gradually thinned.” This day’s amusement was done. At least in this courtroom.
Similar dramas were taking place in other offices throughout the city. No one knew who was in charge. Inside City Hall, according to the Republican, “various administrators are expecting an attempt on their official positions.” That afternoon Sheriff Harper walked into Sheriff Sauvinet’s office with his new commission and told Sauvinet to leave. Sauvinet refused. If they wanted him out, he said, they would have to force him out. Before a fight erupted Algernon Badger, superintendent of Warmoth’s Metropolitan Police department, showed up and defused the situation. Sauvinet left peacefully.
The two secretaries of state had also argued over that office, but Herron held it.
So much was happening so quickly in so many different places that it was impossible to keep track of events. The two gubernatorial candidates were both claiming victory. Lawsuits and countersuits had been filed in state and federal courts. In the Eighth District, where several of those lawsuits would be heard, two judges were fighting over who belonged on the bench. Three Returning Boards had been formed, and all were claiming the right to count the votes. Two sheriffs and deputy sheriffs demanded their opponent surrender the office. Numerous clerks and secretaries had no idea who was in charge or if they even still had their jobs.
None of this seemed to concern Warmoth. He continued attacking. For each legal setback he found an answer. His fight to get Judge Elmore on the bench proved worthwhile. Elmore threw out the previous verdict, ruling that the new election law dissolved previous boards. He dismissed all the legal challenges. It was a victory for Warmoth. To consolidate his power, he called the newly elected legislature into a special session on December
