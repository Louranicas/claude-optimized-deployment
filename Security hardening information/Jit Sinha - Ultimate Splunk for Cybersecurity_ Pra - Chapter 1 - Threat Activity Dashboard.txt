Threat Activity Dashboard:

Situation: JIT Inc. has observed an increase in network traffic aimed at its servers that are visible to the outside world, which prompts concerns about possible cyberattackers using this traffic for reconnaissance.
How It Assists: JIT Inc. receives real-time insights about potential threats discovered throughout their network using the Threat Activity Dashboard. It gathers and presents feeds of threat intelligence, emphasizing dubious IP addresses, domain names, and other signs of compromise (IoCs). JIT Inc. can promptly detect trends suggestive of reconnaissance or other malevolent activity by keeping an eye on this dashboard, which allows them to take preventative measures.
