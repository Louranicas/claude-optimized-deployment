I dedicate this book to two women in my life who made 
this book possible. First is my mom, who emphasized a 
love of reading and education that gave me the capac-
ity to write. Second is my wife, who has been my biggest 
fan, encouraged me to write the book, and put up with 
the hours of me sitting at my desk writing it. And to my 
father, who taught me the qualities of a great business 
leader, father, and husband.
