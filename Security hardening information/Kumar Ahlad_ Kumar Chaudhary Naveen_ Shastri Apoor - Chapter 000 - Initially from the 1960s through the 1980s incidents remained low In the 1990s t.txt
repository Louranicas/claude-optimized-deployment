Initially, from the 1960s through the 1980s, incidents remained low. In the 1990s, there was a slight increase, followed by a more noticeable rise in the 2000s. The number of incidents escalated sharply in the 2010s and peaked in the 2020s, reaching around 50,000.

FIGURE 9.1 Increase in cybercrime since 1960s to 2020s.

The increase in cybercrime from the 1960s to the 2020s can be attributed to several key factors, each contributing to the rise in both the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks. The factors such as Proliferation of Technology, Advancements in Technology, Economic Incentives, Insufficient Security Measures, Globalization, Social Engineering and Human Factors, Pandemic-Driven Changes and Political and Economic Factors contributed to the growth of increase in cybercrime (Amaral et al., 2019).
The rapid expansion of the internet has exponentially increased the number of potential targets. From a few interconnected academic and military computers in the 1960s, the internet now connects billions of devices worldwide. The advent of affordable personal computers in the 1980s democratized access to technology, creating more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. The proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices in recent decades has expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals. Many of these devices have inadequate security measures, making them easy targets.
Cybercriminals now have access to advanced tools and techniques, including automated hacking tools, ransomware, and sophisticated phishing schemes. The rise of the dark web has facilitated the distribution of these tools and services. Additionally, AI and machine learning technologies have been leveraged to create more effective and harder-to-detect attacks, such as deepfake videos and adaptive phishing schemes.
The financial gains from cybercrime have driven its increase. Ransomware attacks, online fraud, and the sale of stolen data are lucrative ventures. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have made it easier to conduct transactions anonymously. Organized crime groups have recognized the profitability of cybercrime and have developed sophisticated operations to carry out large-scale attacks and fraud.
As technology has advanced, security measures have often lagged behind. Many individuals and organizations do not prioritize cybersecurity, leaving systems vulnerable to attack. The complexity and interconnectedness of modern systems make it difficult to secure them adequately. Vulnerabilities in one system can often be exploited to gain access to others.
The internet’s global nature allows cybercriminals to operate across borders, complicating law enforcement efforts. Jurisdictional challenges and differing legal frameworks make it difficult to pursue and prosecute cybercriminals internationally. Global trade and communication mean that more entities are online, increasing the number of potential targets for cybercriminals.
Cybercriminals have become adept at exploiting human psychology through social engineering techniques. Phishing attacks, for instance, prey on individuals’ trust and lack of awareness. Many users are not sufficiently aware of the risks and best practices in cybersecurity, making them easy targets for cybercriminals.
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to remote work, often without adequate security measures in place. This has provided new opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in home networks and remote access systems. The pandemic also increased overall online activity, including e-commerce and online services, creating more opportunities for cybercrime.
Nation-states engage in cyber espionage and cyberwarfare, targeting other countries’ infrastructure, government systems, and private sector assets. These activities have contributed to the overall increase in cybercrime incidents. In some regions, economic hardship drives individuals towards cybercrime as a means of financial gain.
The increase in cybercrime from the 1960s to the 2020s is a multifaceted issue driven by technological advancements, economic incentives, globalization, insufficient security measures, social engineering, pandemic-driven changes, and political factors. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach involving improved cybersecurity practices, international cooperation, public awareness campaigns, and robust legislative frameworks.


9.4 Reducing the Cyber Crime
It is essential to use a multi-pronged strategy in order to bring about a reduction in the amount of cybercrime. The implementation of this strategy ought to incorporate technological approaches, legal frameworks, educational activities, and international cooperation. By applying a few strategies, such as ensuring that software is frequently updated and patched, enforcing strong password restrictions, installing firewalls and antivirus software, and utilizing encryption to secure essential data, we could prevent ourselves from being victims of cybercrime.
It is important that both employers and members of the general public receive frequent training on the best practices for cybersecurity. Additionally, awareness campaigns should be conducted to educate people about the hazards of cybercrime and how they can protect themselves when using the internet.
It is imperative that comprehensive cybercrime laws be developed and maintained up-to-date, and that data protection mechanisms be put into place and enforced, in order to guarantee that personal information is handled in a responsible manner. Victims should be encouraged to report incidents in order to aid law enforcement in tracking down and combating cybercrime. Plans for responding to events should be made and maintained, clear ways should be established for reporting cybercrime, and victims should be encouraged to report incidents (Qiao et al., 2021).
In addition to demonstrating support for and involvement in international treaties and agreements that combat cybercrime, it is important to foster collaboration across international borders, as well as the exchange of knowledge and best practices among governments. Making investments in research on cybersecurity, collaborating with academic institutions to foster innovation, and offering training to individuals working in the field of cybersecurity are all important responsibilities.
It is important to foster the creation of industry standards and best practices for cybersecurity, as well as to encourage collaboration between government agencies and businesses in the private sector working together. In order to detect irregularities and possible dangers in real time, it is necessary to make use of AI and machine learning. It is also important to explore whether or not blockchain technology has the capacity to adequately secure data and transactions.
Frequent security audits and vulnerability assessments are essential in order to encourage ethical hackers to find and report security issues. This can be accomplished by conducting these activities. In addition to that, bug reward schemes ought to be implemented. Monitoring the activities of users through the use of behavior analytics and putting in place tight access control methods are both strongly recommended.
It is possible for individuals, organizations, and governments to achieve a more robust cybersecurity posture by implementing these strategies, which will result in a reduction in the frequency and severity of cybercrime. This will be accomplished by creating a more robust cybersecurity posture. Table 9.2 provides a comprehensive view.

9.5 Software Support to Avoid Cyber Crime
Currently, there is a plethora of programs accessible to assist in the prevention of cybercrime. Malicious software, such as spyware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms, are examples of harmful programs that antivirus software is specifically designed to protect computers from. Cybersecurity depends on information technology. Firewalls utilize pre-established security standards to oversee and control every data packet that passes across a company’s network. Firewalls efficiently impede unauthorized access by bad actors, such as hackers, by creating a physical barrier between reliable internal networks and the external world. Data packets are encrypted using virtual private networks (VPNs) before being transmitted over the internet. While accessing sensitive data remotely, they use security measures to encrypt it so that only authorized individuals can decipher it.
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are examples of security software that monitor data transfers across networks in order to detect and assess both typical and unusual threats. Security administrators are notified by IDSs anytime they identify what seems like an attempt at unauthorized access, in contrast to IPSs. The endpoint protection systems ensure the safety of all endpoint devices, including computers, laptops, cellphones, and more. Security measures include things like antivirus programs, firewalls, and IPSs. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems aim to prevent unauthorized access by monitoring, detecting, and restricting the flow of sensitive data from computers, storage devices, and networks (Gupta et al., 2021).
System for information and event management (SIEM) systematically searches many logs for indicators of intrusion, policy violations, and other potential threats. In times of crisis, they are second to none when it comes to gathering intelligence on potential threats and keeping a close eye on things. Technologies that encrypt data make it impossible for unauthorized individuals to access or intercept it. Their comprehensive protection extends to every step of the data lifecycle, including generation, transfer, and storage across several devices, channels, and files. Identity and access management (IAM) systems safeguard critical information by keeping tabs on user identities, roles, and permissions. The method they’ve developed for protecting against internal threats, identity fraud, and unauthorized access is second to none.
Web application firewalls (WAFs) constantly monitor and filter HTTP traffic to defend networks from typical cyber threats including DDoS, Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). By reducing the possibility of cybercrime, these software solutions can significantly improve cybersecurity when utilized and maintained effectively. A number of software solutions are described and analyzed in detail in Table 9.
