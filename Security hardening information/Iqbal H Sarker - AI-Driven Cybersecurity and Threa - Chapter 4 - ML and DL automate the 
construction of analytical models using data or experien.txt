1.4 AI Trust, Explainability, and Key Factors 
When it comes to accountability, transparency, and the capability to comprehend 
and trust AI-driven security systems, traditional AI and explainable AI (XAI) have 
diverse implications and applications in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity. Let’s compare 
these two strategies in terms of cybersecurity.
14 1 Introduction to AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence
1.4.1 Traditional AI in Cybersecurity 
The term “traditional AI” refers to the application of traditional artiﬁcial intelligence 
methods and models to security issues. The employment of well-proven algorithms 
and techniques that have been extensively employed in the ﬁeld for years character-
izes traditional AI methodologies. In the following, we highlight several key features 
associated with traditional AI: 
• Complex Models: Deep neural networks and other sophisticated machine learn-
ing models [ 1] are frequently used in traditional AI in cybersecurity to perform 
tasks like intrusion detection, malware classiﬁcation, and anomaly detection. 
These models can analyze vast amounts of data and perform well to identify 
complex data patterns. 
• Lack of Transparency: Lack of transparency is the main problem with tradi-
tional AI in cybersecurity. Interpreting complex models and comprehending the 
reasoning behind speciﬁc security decisions can be challenging. This lack of 
transparency can undermine responsibility and trust. 
• Effectiveness: When trained on massive datasets, traditional AI can be partic-
ularly effective at identifying and responding to cyber threats. However, the 
inability to explain the reasoning behind its decisions can be a signiﬁcant 
limitation. 
• Use Cases: Network security, endpoint security, and threat intelligence are some 
of the cybersecurity applications that frequently use traditional AI. Based on data 
trends, it can identify existing and emerging threats, but it can be challenging to 
explain its results. 
In summary, traditional AI is a useful tool for cybersecurity, especially for identi-
fying trends, analyzing massive datasets, and detecting known threats. However, its 
black box nature can present difﬁculties in terms of transparency and explainability. 
To overcome these issues, explainable AI (XAI) is becoming more and more 
important in the cybersecurity industry. 
1.4.2 Explainable AI (XAI) in Cybersecurity 
Explainable AI (XAI) in cybersecurity aims to make AI-made security decisions 
and actions transparent and understandable to humans. To address the “black box” 
issue usually associated with sophisticated artiﬁcial intelligence models, XAI aims 
to increase the transparency and accountability of the decision-making process. In 
the following, we highlight several key features associated with explainable AI: 
• Interpretable Models: XAI in cybersecurity strongly emphasizes on interpretable 
machine learning models and methods or other relevant techniques rather than 
black box modeling. These interpretable models are created to generate outcomes 
that are easier to explain and comprehend.
1.4 AI Trust, Explainability, and Key Factors 15
• Transparency: Enhancing accountability and transparency is the main objective 
of XAI in cybersecurity. It aims to give rational justiﬁcations for security 
decisions made by AI systems so that security experts can trust these decisions and validate them. 
• Trust and Accountability: The trust issue with AI-driven cybersecurity is addressed by XAI. Thus, XAI helps security teams make better decisions by explaining alerts about risk so they can comprehend the reasoning behind AI-
generated recommendations. 
• Use Cases: In critical cybersecurity applications where understanding and supporting decisions are crucial, XAI is especially beneﬁcial. Examples include 
describing the justiﬁcation for tagging a network behavior as suspicious, provid-ing explanations about why a speciﬁc ﬁle is regarded as malicious, or outlining the reasoning for denying a security access request. 
In summary, explainable AI (XAI) is essential for improving accountability, 
trust, and transparency in cybersecurity. XAI assists security teams in better 
comprehending, validating, and acting upon the insights produced by AI systems. 
Thus, it can enhance the overall security posture of organizations as well as maintain regulatory compliance. 
1.4.3 Recommendation: AI vs XAI 
As discussed earlier, both traditional AI and explainable AI (XAI) each have their place in cybersecurity. Traditional AI is proﬁcient in detecting complex 
threats, while XAI focuses on transparency and interpretability. The choice between traditional AI and XAI depends on the speciﬁc cybersecurity needs and priorities of an organization. In the following, we highlight a few key points: 
• Trade-Off Between Complexity and Interpretability: Traditional AI could be effective at detecting sophisticated and new threats; however, XAI emphasizes 
interpretability over overwhelming complexity. The organization’s particular cybersecurity requirements and priorities will determine which of the two options is preferable. 
• Regulatory Compliance: In some industries and businesses, regulations mandate the use of AI systems that can provide explanations for their decisions. Thus, XAI might be more appropriate to help relevant organizations comply with legal 
obligations, especially in the aspect of cybersecurity. 
• Hybrid Approaches: Some cybersecurity systems use hybrid approaches, which bring together the power of traditional AI for threat identiﬁcation and XAI for 
decision explanation. In this way, they will beneﬁt from the advantages of each strategy. 
Overall, the choice should be made based on the distinct security requirements, 
legal requirements, and the signiﬁcance of comprehending and explaining AI-driven security judgments inside an organization’s cybersecurity strategy.

1.5 An Overview of This Book 
The book focuses mainly on AI-based cybersecurity solutions or how valuable 
insights can be extracted from cybersecurity data through examples, as well as how 
these insights could be utilized to design intelligent cybersecurity applications. It 
is important to note that AI-based strategies differ from traditional ones in terms 
of adaptation and intelligence. As such, we have provided below the basic outline of the book that covers a background analysis, multi-aspects of AI-based solutions, 
and research challenges with potential future directions. 
In this chapter, the intentions and purpose of this book are clariﬁed by intro-
ducing deﬁnitions, concepts, and principles of AI-driven cybersecurity and threat 
intelligence toward intelligent applications.
