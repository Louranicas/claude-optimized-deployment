Chapter: 1 - Reconnaissance: This phase serves as the initial phase in which the hacker gathers essential information about the organization, including system configurations, login details, and network structure. This reconnaissance is vital for planning attacks and encompasses:Identifying naming conventionsDetermining services running on the networkLocating servers managing workloads within the networkDocumenting IP addressesAcquiring usernames and login credentials of network usersEstablishing the physical location of the target machine
Scanning: During the scanning phase, the hacker seeks expedient pathways to access the network and gather intelligence. This phase entails three methods: pre-attack, port scanning/sniffing, and information extraction. Each method exposes distinct vulnerabilities that the hacker can exploit to capitalize on the system’s weaknesses. The pre-attack phase involves scanning the network for specific information based on reconnaissance findings. In the port scanning or sniffing phase, various tools, such as dialers, port scanners, and vulnerability scanners, are utilized to scan the network and gather data. The information extraction phase entails collecting details about ports, live machines, and operating systems to prepare for an attack.

Gaining access: During this stage, the hacker manipulates the information obtained in the previous phase to infiltrate sensitive data. With this data and access to the network, they launch attacks on additional targets. At this point, the attackers hold a degree of control over other devices. Techniques such as brute-force attacks may be employed to breach the system. This phase revolves around exploiting known vulnerabilities within the target system, whether it is a network or a computer system. Methods for gaining access vary depending on the hacker’s area of expertise, ranging from password cracking to exploiting weakly encrypted network segments.
Maintaining access: When infiltrating an organization’s network, hackers typically have specific goals or strategies in mind. Ethical hackers not only gain access to the system, but also retain access to the system or network until their objectives are met. This often involves using Trojans, backdoors, or rootkits to maintain access. During this phase, ethical hackers may also launch additional attacks to cause further damage to the organization.
Clearing tracks: This final step represents the culmination of the entire ethical hacking process. Successful completion of this phase means the ethical hacker has infiltrated a system or network, causing maximum potential damage, and has exited without leaving any trace behind. Throughout this phase, clearing tracks is most important to avoid detection during both entry and exit from the network or server. The security systems in place should remain oblivious to the attacker’s presence, indicating a thoroughly successful simulated cyber attack. To achieve this, ethical hackers undertake various measures to conceal and eradicate their presence entirely, including:Deleting all system logs.Corrupting existing logs to render them unusable.Altering values within logs or registries to obfuscate any incriminating evidence.Erasing all folders created during the ethical hacking process.Uninstalling any applications utilized during the attack.Removing all traces of activity performed within the system or network by the ethical hacker.

By executing these steps, the ethical hacker ensures that their intrusion remains undetected, thereby fulfilling the objective of a successful simulated cyber attack.
Hacktivism
Hacktivism, originating from the fusion of Hack and Activism, is the practice of hacking or infiltrating computer systems with political or social objectives in mind. It involves the utilization of digital tools and cybercrime techniques to execute attacks motivated by religious, political, or moral ideals. These motivations may be perceived as either ethical or unethical, depending on one’s perspective.
Hacktivism typically targets government or corporate entities, although it may extend to any notable institution, including religious groups, drug dealers, terrorists, and others. An individual who participates in hacktivism, engaging in actions such as defacing a website or disclosing an organization’s information, is commonly referred to as a hacktivist. Hacktivism attacks are often conducted by groups of individuals united in their objectives, as shown in Figure 2.
