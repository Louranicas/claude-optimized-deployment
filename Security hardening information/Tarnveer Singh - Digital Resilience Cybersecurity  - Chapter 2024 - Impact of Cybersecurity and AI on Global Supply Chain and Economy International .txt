A Comprehensive Strategy
Cyber threats pose a significant risk to businesses, particularly those with complex supply chains. As organisations increasingly rely on digital technologies to streamline operations and enhance efficiency, the potential for cyber attacks has escalated. Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain, leading to data breaches, operational disruptions, financial losses, and reputational damage.
Cyber threats can manifest in various forms, including malware, phishing attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). These threats can target any aspect of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing, distribution, and customer delivery. A single breach in the supply chain can have far-reaching consequences, affecting multiple stakeholders and potentially disrupting entire operations.
The impact of cyber threats on supply chain security cannot be overstated. A successful attack can result in the theft of sensitive data, such as intellectual property, trade secrets, or customer information. It can also disrupt production lines, delay shipments, and undermine customer trust. In some cases, cyber attacks can even lead to physical harm or environmental damage, particularly in industries that rely on critical infrastructure.
We have discussed how the importance of operational resilience in securing your supply chain is immeasurable. Operational resilience is a crucial component of supply chain security, enabling organisations to withstand and recover from disruptions, including cyber attacks. By fostering operational resilience, companies can minimise the impact of cyber threats and ensure business continuity, even in the face of adverse events.
Achieving operational resilience requires a holistic approach that encompasses people, processes, and technologies. It involves identifying critical assets and processes, implementing robust risk management strategies, and establishing contingency plans to maintain essential operations during and after a cyber incident.
Organisations with strong operational resilience are better equipped to respond swiftly and effectively to cyber threats, minimising downtime and reducing the potential for long-term consequences. They can quickly adapt to changing circumstances, leveraging redundancies and alternative suppliers or distribution channels to maintain supply chain operations.
Digital resilience is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various aspects of cybersecurity, risk management, and business continuity. It involves implementing a comprehensive strategy to protect digital assets, detect and respond to cyber threats, and recover from incidents while maintaining critical operations.
Ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of sensitive data through backup and recovery strategies, data governance policies, and secure data handling practices. Digital resilience relies on aspects including implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against cyber threats, such as firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and access controls.
Maintaining the resilience of critical infrastructure, including networks, servers, and cloud environments, through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery planning. Developing and deploying resilient applications that can withstand cyber attacks, recover from failures, and maintain functionality during incidents.
Establishing resilient business processes that can adapt to disruptions, incorporating risk management practices, and leveraging automation and digitisation to enhance efficiency and agility. By addressing these components holistically, organisations can build a comprehensive digital resilience strategy that safeguards their supply chain operations from cyber threats and ensures business continuity.
Assessing and managing cyber risks in the supply chain is a critical step in building digital resilience. This process involves identifying potential vulnerabilities, evaluating the likelihood and impact of cyber threats, and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies.
We discussed how to effectively assess and manage cyber risks: organisations should consider developing a comprehensive understanding of the entire supply chain, including all stakeholders, processes, and dependencies. This mapping exercise helps identify potential entry points for cyber threats and areas of heightened risk.
Conduct regular risk assessments to identify and prioritise cyber risks within the supply chain. This assessment should consider factors such as the criticality of assets, the likelihood of threats, and the potential impact on operations. Implement a robust vendor risk management programme to assess and monitor the cybersecurity posture of third-party suppliers and partners. This includes evaluating their security practices, conducting audits, and establishing contractual obligations for cybersecurity compliance.
Develop comprehensive incident response and recovery plans to address cyber incidents within the supply chain. These plans should outline roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and step-by-step procedures for containment, eradication, and recovery. Regularly monitor and assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies, and continuously improve security measures based on evolving cyber threats and industry best practices.
By proactively assessing and managing cyber risks, organisations can identify potential vulnerabilities, implement appropriate safeguards, and enhance the overall resilience of their supply chain operations.
We considered best practices for building digital resilience in your organisation. Building digital resilience requires a comprehensive approach that involves people, processes, and technologies.
Foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness and vigilance throughout the organisation. Provide regular training and education to employees, emphasising the importance of secure practices and their role in protecting digital assets.
Implement robust cybersecurity measures by deploying a multi-layered cybersecurity strategy that includes firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and encryption technologies. Regularly update and patch systems to address known vulnerabilities.
Develop detailed incident response and recovery plans that outline steps to detect, contain, and recover from cyber incidents. Regularly test and update these plans to ensure their effectiveness. Explore the use of cloud computing and automation technologies to enhance resilience and agility. Cloud services can provide scalability, redundancy, and disaster recovery capabilities, while automation can streamline processes and reduce human error.
Establish robust access controls and identity management practices to ensure that only authorised individuals have access to critical systems and data. Implement multi-factor authentication and regularly review and update access privileges. Perform periodic risk assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities, evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures, and prioritise areas for improvement.
Collaborate with industry partners, government agencies, and cybersecurity experts to share threat intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned. Participate in information-sharing platforms and initiatives to stay informed about emerging threats and mitigation strategies.
Regularly review and update your digital resilience strategy to align with evolving cyber threats, technological advancements, and industry best practices. Embrace a culture of continuous improvement and adaptation to maintain a strong cybersecurity posture.
By implementing these best practices, organisations can enhance their digital resilience, better protect their supply chain operations, and ensure business continuity in the face of cyber threats.

Case Studies
To illustrate the importance and effectiveness of digital resilience strategies, let’s consider two final case studies of organisations that successfully implemented robust measures to secure their supply chain operations against cyber threats.
Case Study 1: Global Pharmaceutical Company: Pfizer1
Pfizer, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recognised the critical importance of supply chain security in ensuring the safe and timely delivery of life-saving medications to patients worldwide. To enhance digital resilience, the company implemented cross-institutional collaboration. Collaboration between CISOs across the pharma industry enabled an agreed supply chain security framework.

We discussed how cybersecurity awareness and training plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of supply chain operations. Human error and lack of awareness can often be the weakest link in an organisation’s cybersecurity defences, making it essential to cultivate a culture of security vigilance among employees.
Effective cybersecurity awareness and training programmes should be targeted. Educate employees about the various types of cyber threats, such as phishing attacks, malware, and social engineering tactics, and how they can impact supply chain operations.
Provide guidance on secure practices, including strong password management, identifying and reporting suspicious emails or activities, and handling sensitive data securely. Train employees on the appropriate steps to take in the event of a suspected or confirmed cyber incident, including reporting protocols and escalation procedures.
Tailor training programmes to address the specific cybersecurity risks and responsibilities associated with different roles within the supply chain, such as procurement, logistics, and manufacturing. Implement ongoing awareness campaigns and refresher training sessions to reinforce cybersecurity best practices and ensure that employees remain vigilant against evolving threats.
Conduct simulated phishing exercises, tabletop exercises, and other interactive scenarios to test employees’ ability to identify and respond to cyber threats in a controlled environment. By fostering a strong cybersecurity culture through comprehensive awareness and training programmes, organisations can empower their employees to become active participants in securing the supply chain against cyber threats.

Collaboration
We considered how collaborating with partners and suppliers to strengthen digital resilience is vital. Building digital resilience in the supply chain requires coordination among all stakeholders, including partners and suppliers. By working together and sharing information, organisations can collectively enhance their cybersecurity posture and better protect the entire supply chain ecosystem.
Effective collaboration with partners and suppliers is necessary. Establish clear cybersecurity requirements and standards that partners and suppliers must adhere to. These standards should cover areas such as data protection, incident response, access controls, and regular security assessments. Participate in industry-wide information-sharing platforms and initiatives to exchange threat intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned. This collaborative approach helps identify and mitigate emerging cyber threats more effectively. Conduct joint risk assessments and audits with partners and suppliers to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement within the shared supply chain ecosystem. Develop coordinated incident response plans and communication protocols to ensure a swift and effective response in the event of a cyber incident affecting multiple stakeholders within the supply chain. Collaborate on developing and delivering cybersecurity awareness and training programmes tailored to the specific needs and risks of the supply chain ecosystem. Foster an environment of continuous improvement and innovation by exploring new technologies, processes, and strategies to enhance digital resilience within the supply chain.
By fostering collaboration and leveraging the collective expertise and resources of partners and suppliers, organisations can create a more resilient and secure supply chain ecosystem, better equipped to withstand and recover from cyber threats.

Emerging Trends
As digital technologies continue to evolve and cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, the importance of digital resilience in supply chain management will only grow. Organisations must stay ahead of the curve by anticipating and adapting to emerging trends and challenges.
The future of digital resilience will be based on the adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These will reshape supply chain operations. These technologies can enhance visibility, automation, and security, but they also introduce new vulnerabilities that must be addressed through robust digital resilience strategies.
As the demand for cybersecurity professionals continues to rise, organisations will need to invest in developing and retaining skilled talent to support their digital resilience efforts within the supply chain.
Evolving regulations and industry standards related to cybersecurity, data privacy, and supply chain transparency will drive the need for enhanced digital resilience measures and compliance frameworks. The increasing digitisation and automation of supply chain processes will necessitate stronger cybersecurity measures and resilient systems to protect against potential disruptions and cyber threats.
Collaborative efforts and information sharing among industry partners, government agencies, and cybersecurity experts will become even more critical in addressing the global nature of cyber threats and maintaining supply chain resilience. As cyber threats evolve, organisations must embrace a mindset of continuous adaptation and innovation, regularly reviewing and updating their digital resilience strategies to stay ahead of emerging risks.

Appendices
Appendix A – Example SCM Policy (SMEs)
Purpose
This policy describes the minimum requirements for managing information risks resulting from the utilisation of a supplier’s services and/or products.
All new supplier relationships must comply with these requirements by [Insert Date].
All existing supplier relationships must comply with these requirements by [Insert Date].

Scope
All supplier relationships (including IT and non-IT relationships) are in scope for this policy and its supporting documentation.
Due to the unique requirements of contracting with government and regulatory agencies, exceptions may be made to the scope of this policy.

Definitions

Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) products: Packaged solutions which are adapted to satisfy the needs of the organisation making the purchase, rather than the commissioning of custom-made solutions.
Contractual Documents: Legally binding and appropriately signed legal documents between Organisation and the Supplier. They can take multiple forms such as Master Service Agreements, Amendment, Addendum, Task Order, Statement of Work, etc.
Cybersecurity: The protection of information and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Executive Sponsor: Organisational leader with the accountability for the business risks that originate from the utilisation of a Supplier’s services and/or products and is able to influence and obtain organisational resources to address those risks.
Relationship Owner: Organisation employee who is accountable for the relationship with the Supplier. Relationship Owners can delegate their responsibilities but not their accountability. A Relationship Owner:Is the primary Organisation point of contact for the Supplier.
Consults with the Global Sourcing and Procurement function and collaborates with other relationship owners, where a Supplier has multiple engagements with Organisation, to provide comprehensive oversite to the relationship.
Understands and stays updated about the services and/or products provided by the Supplier.
Collaborates with appropriate IT functions to manage Supplier information risks.

Supplier Information Risk Management: Risk Management practices employed to identify, manage, and mitigate the level of information risk resulting from the utilisation of a Supplier’s services and/or products.
Supplier Relationship: Any engagement with a Supplier responsible for handling Company information, paid or unpaid, resulting from a legally binding contract. One or more contracts can constitute a single supplier relationship.


Requirements
This policy follows the Supplier relationship through four different phases. These phases include: Pre-contracting Due Diligence, Contracting, Supplier Governance and Ongoing Monitoring, Expiration/termination of Supplier Contract and Relationship. These phases account for the overall life cycle of a supplier relationship.
Since this policy is taking the life cycle approach to managing Supplier risks, the role of Relationship Owner becomes critically important to manage Supplier risks. This role’s responsibilities are discussed in the following sections and are spread across all the phases of the relationship.

Pre-contracting Due Diligence

Prior to signing off on a contract, the following requirements must be met. Government or regulatory agencies are exempt from this requirement when the type of engagement does not permit it.

The Supplier must demonstrate a current, valid, and appropriate certification of cybersecurity posture.
If the Supplier does not demonstrate a current, valid, and appropriate certification, a risk assessment must be performed.
Relationship Owners must plan for and complete the remediation of identified gaps uncovered by the risk assessment in a satisfactory timeframe after signing off on the contract, or as agreed by the executive sponsor.


Supplier Contracting

Relationship Owners must ensure the following security requirements are met or as needed defined in contracts or service agreements:

Suppliers must hold and maintain current, relevant, and appropriate certifications and/or attestations when the services and/or products provided need to comply with laws or regulations requiring such certifications (e.g., PCI-DSS).
Ensure contracts incorporate a right to audit the Supplier or the right to obtain evidence of an independent audit (e.g., Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 type SOC2, or International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402).
Where relevant (e.g., externally hosted systems or applications, SaaS, Cloud, etc.), ensure the contract incorporates a right to perform or request evidence of vulnerability scans of Supplier information systems that host or process company information.
Changes in Supplier personnel with access to Organisation information including changes in role must be communicated to affected Relationship Owners as soon as possible.
When Suppliers providing services to Organisation engage with additional suppliers (e.g., 4th or 5th party suppliers/aggregators, subcontractors, etc.), the information risk management terms and conditions of our contract are applicable to their lower-tier agreements as well.
Supplier access to internal systems and data must require use of credentials that meet minimum criteria established by Organisation and Relationship Owners must ensure access by authorised supplier personnel only.



Supplier Governance and Ongoing Monitoring

Managers of Relationship Owners must ensure new Relationship Owners are assigned when there is a change in the Relationship Owner for a given Supplier.
When a Supplier has multiple relationships with the organisation, all associated Relationship Owners must participate in the governance of the Supplier.
When modifications are made to an existing Supplier relationship that result in changes to our Organisation’s information systems or changes in the access to Organisation information, the Supplier risk assessment must be refreshed.
Relationship Owners must ensure that the Supplier’s access to Organisation information assets is appropriately updated when personnel change notifications are received from the Supplier. Access changes must be implemented in line with the Organisation’s own information security policy.
Ensure information exchanges occur over connections that are secure, authorised, maintained, and terminated when the engagement ends or the scope of the Supplier relationship changes.

7.1 The Organisation must conduct an annual review of established information exchange connections between the Organisation and Suppliers and take appropriate action.

Expiration/termination of Supplier Contracts and Relationship
Suppliers may have one or more contracts with the Organisation. In a single-contract relationship, the expiration or termination of the contract results in the termination of the entire relationship with the Supplier. In multiple-contract relationships where additional contracts are still in effect, the expiration or termination of a single contract does not necessarily result in the expiration or termination of the entire relationship. In those cases, follow the requirements outlined in the contract that has expired or is being terminated.

Where information is not stored on Organisation-managed infrastructure, Relationship Owners must ensure that Organisation information is returned securely to Organisation at the end of the relationship or upon expiration or termination of the relationship, unless agreed upon in the original contract. This includes both electronic and non-electronic information.
When the Supplier hosts or processes Organisation information using its own information systems, Relationship Owners must ensure that after the required information has been returned to Organisation, the Supplier securely erases or destroys Organisation information from its information systems including backup and archival media and provides evidence that the information was securely erased or destroyed, unless agreed upon in the original contract.
Access by Supplier personnel to Organisation information and information systems must be removed as part of the expiration or termination of Supplier relationships. Any physical connections (e.g., site-to-site VPN) and system-to-system integrations must also be disconnected as part of the expiration or termination of the relationship.
Where applicable, Relationship Owners must also ensure that the Organisation’s information assets (e.g., laptops or mobile devices etc.) are securely returned to the Organisation at the end of the relationship without erasing the contents, unless agreed upon in the original contract. The proper disposition of Organisation’s software licences must also be addressed as part of this process.
