Chapter: 1874 - It had all the trappings of justice. It was held in the magnificent second-floor courtroom in the Custom House. The majestic courtroom, with its thirty-six-foot-high ceilings, mahogany railings and darkly paneled walls, was overflowing with spectators. The majority of them were Black residents of New Orleans. They filled the courtroom and the corridors, hoping their presence would help to ensure their rights were protected.
Coincidently, the day the trial began, the Picayune reported that the fight to determine the winner of two Louisiana Congressional seats—eighteen months after the election—continued in a different courtroom. Lawyers were requesting access to the ballots, which presumably were being safeguarded in Washington. The people who held those ballots refused to produce them unless it was guaranteed that Kellogg’s people wouldn’t seize them—and Kellogg remained silent.
Judge William B. Woods presided over the Colfax trial. It was a good fit. Woods, a Union general who had fought at Vicksburg, had settled in Alabama after the war to raise cotton and practice law. Grant had appointed him to the federal bench. He was well acquainted with challenges to the Fourteenth Amendment. In a controversial ruling three years earlier, he had upheld the Enforcement Act, which in certain situations permitted the federal government to impose penalties on individuals who violated that Amendment’s protections of life, liberty, property and “equal protection of the laws.” He also had ruled in the lower court decision in the Slaughterhouse Cases that the state had violated that Amendment, a decision that the Supreme Court had overturned on appeal.
Six years after this trial, President Hayes would name him to the Supreme Court.
The trial began with the selection of a jury pool, from which the twelve-man jury would be picked. That is rarely contentious, but nothing about this trial was normal. Setting the stage for what was to come, the prosecution and defense argued over the method used to choose the pool. In a trial in which race was going to play a fundamental role, the racial makeup of the jury might well determine the outcome. It took Judge Woods two days to sort that out. It took another two days of questioning to finally seat a jury.
The jury consisted of nine white and three Black men. Five of the white men were Democrats. If the case was to be decided on racial grounds it would be almost impossible to get a unanimous verdict. The jury was sequestered in the Custom House for the duration of the trial, prohibited from speaking with other people or reading newspapers.
The trial was a logistical nightmare. More than two hundred and fifty witnesses were called by both sides: most of them transported by steamboat from Grant Parish to New Orleans, put up in hotels and rooming houses and then returned home. They also had to be protected: being involved in this trial was dangerous. Seventy armed militiamen were assigned to protect trial participants. Prosecutor James Beckwith received numerous warnings and death threats. Witnesses were confronted on the streets; one witness was beaten and stabbed.
But still they came to New Orleans, raised their right hands and told of the horrors they had seen. It was a courageous act; most of these people were freed slaves, many of them had never been to New Orleans. Few, if any, had ever testified in a trial, especially in front of hundreds of Black and white spectators. And every one of them knew of the threats.
William Ward testified that he was at home when “a man visited my house late at night and said, ‘Do you not know you will be hung tomorrow? Hadnot has been mustering men for several days and says he will hang you all,’ naming sixteen of us. We held a consultation and Sheriff Shaw was advised to summon a posse...
“...I at that time counted forty men, armed, going toward Jesse McKinney’s house; I heard a gun fire and someone said Jesse was murdered...” That killing had caused frightened people to come into the town for protection, Ward explained. Those people “had no design to attack anyone, or be aggressive. I came to New Orleans to get Governor Kellogg to send troops to Colfax.”
Alabama Mitchell, who hobbled to the stand because his right leg had been ripped apart by shot, remembered being in the courthouse when it was set on fire. “We then hung out a paper flag and a shirt sleeve and cried out ‘Surrender.’ The white men told us to come out, we should not be hurt. Some ten or twelve had come out headed by Tillman, when the white men fired at them. I ran back and hid under the floor.” After being captured, the mob took several prisoners “in a field and commenced shooting at us. They called us out, by name, two at a time...the prisoners jumped up and ran for the woods... I ran on until I could run no longer, and then crawled into the woods: there I waited two days and night...”
Day after day the testimony continued. The killers were identified by name: Cruikshank. Penn. Irwin. Hadnot. Lemoine. Hickman. Marsh. Lewis. And more, many more.
Levi Nelson’s halting testimony was especially dramatic. He identified several of the defendants, saying, “They kept up the fight all day... Shack White held up a white leaf and asked them not to kill him; Irwin shot him down.” After escaping from the burning courthouse, “I asked if I might go; he cursed me, saying he did not come 400 miles to kill n——— for nothing...they took me and another man out to shoot us; one bullet struck me in my neck, stunning and dropping me. The other man was killed. They shot him five times... One man inside the courthouse was shot and disemboweled and he was burned up alive...”
His final words echoed through the large courtroom. “I was a voter.”
During several hours of cross-examination, the defense tried to poke holes in his story, suggesting that several brothers who were there looked alike and he might easily confuse them, asking Nelson specific questions about time and distance. In response, Nelson gave an even more detailed description of his experience that day. “The man who was taken out to be killed with me was Mac Brown; he and I were side-by-side; the man who shot us stood about fifteen feet from us; he said he was going to shoot us through our heads. When he fired we both fell. I on my face; laid there until daylight... Mac Brown yelled after he fell. The man shot him five times.”
The cross-examination failed. According to the Republican, “Had witness been in free command of language it may be that the counsel would have been confused. It was evident that Levi knew exactly what he was saying, although he had a halting way of expressing himself.”
Meekin Jones swore he had only gone to Colfax “because I could not work contented. I saw men in arms... I considered that I was unsafe when they were threatening to kill us; felt safer in Colfax than in my field because if we were together we could defend ourselves...”
Benjamin Brim, who had lost an eye when he was shot, said that he had surrendered and was sent back into the courthouse to bring out the men hiding there. They all came with him, he said, except “one under the floor said he would as soon be burned as shot down. The man who had me said he was not going to shoot me, I stepped again and my captor cocked his pistol, I turned around to look at him and the bullet struck my nose close to my eyes. I fell and laid there sometime... I was shot afterward as I lay on the ground; the bullet entered my back and passed out my side... I was on the ground, my nose full of blood, and as I blew it out they heard me and shot me again, saying, ‘That will do him.’”
Brim eventually crawled into a ditch and watched men and women searching the bodies for valuables then ransacking the Smithfield homes.
Over the course of a week, witness by witness, Beckwith revealed the entire horrific details of the massacre. Men and women marched to the witness stand and told incredible stories of murder and survival. Some of the details were heartbreaking. A woman named Anna Elzie told the court that several Black women had crept back to the town and watched silently from the bushes. Elzie was only a few yards away from her husband, and she heard him pleading for his life and watched him being shot at close range. There was nothing she could do to help him, she remembered. Crying out would have resulted in her own death.
Other women told their stories. Armed men had asked Charlotte Johnson “if I saw any men not dead.” She found her cousin’s body “in a sitting position under a pecan tree.”
The testimony was so shocking that on several days the Fusionist Picayune did not even report on the trial, although they did run a front-page story accusing the governor of granting executive clemency—a pardon—to people convicted of “heinous crimes.” The suggestion was made that money was exchanged.
The defense strategy was set out by its first witness, W. L. Richardson, who testified that the defenders at Colfax “were fully organized, had captains, sergeants and all that, and were drilled in front of the courthouse.” So rather than them being a ragtag group with limited weapons, he gave the impression this was a small militia, fully capable of fighting and ready to resist law enforcement.
The second defense witness was the town doctor, Dr. Conway, who swore that the intentions of the posse were peaceful. “Six delegates were selected to go to Colfax and try to settle the trouble; they were ordered to go unarmed and make no demonstration.” He added that Judge Rutland had sworn out an affidavit against the men who had ransacked his home. Five deputy constables were sworn in, but they were prevented from entering the town. “I saw many armed white men in Montgomery.” He finished, “They said they were armed to prevent an invasion by the n——s.”
These were dangerous men, W. B. Shakelford said, they were criminals. “Rutland’s house was pillaged; I saw trunks broken open in his yard and papers and feathers scattered all around.”
Several witnesses reinforced the claim that the men at Colfax were well organized, trained and armed. They had officers and ranks. They had two or three homemade pieces of artillery. They were determined to hold the courthouse. Sheriff Shaw, testifying for the defense, said, “They were regularly drilled... They had two cannons made of pipes: the men practiced with these. Pickets were posted...”
A man named James Terry claimed he heard several men “say that they intended, if they whipped the whites, to kill them and their children. They made several other bloodthirsty threats.”
Dangerous, threatening men: James Patton raised the hidden fears of the Santo Domingo revolution, telling the jury that Black men “were forming on every plantation; they came up to the store cursing and swearing at the white people and declaring that the country belonged to them and they would rule it.”
Several witnesses provided alibis for men who had been positively identified by prosecution witnesses. Charles Smith swore, “On Easter Sunday I was present with Gibbons and Lemoine the whole day. We were engaged in hog killing and breaking eggs. Neither of them could possibly have been at Colfax.”
Lemoine and Austin Gibbons supposedly were seen “several times that day. They were at [a town] thirteen miles from Colfax. They had been staying there for over a week.”
Arista Simms, a Black servant working for Tom Hickman, testified Hickman “did not leave the house on Easter Sunday because his wife was afraid to stay at home alone. When Mr. Hickman heard of the fight I heard him say it was a shame to kill so many...” Although minutes later a different witness testified to having seen Hickman at another man’s home.
Miss Laura Lewis swore, “My father did not leave home on Easter Sunday.”
The Picayune, which dutifully reported the details of the defense case, reminded readers that the battle had taken place “to decide a contested election...and to install as the duly elected sheriff a man who in open court declares that he was not elected,” and that the defenders at Colfax had a “fierce and unappeasable thirst for war and bloodshed...”
Whatever sympathies the jurors held, the prosecution and the defense had provided sufficient testimony to justify their perspectives. It was up to the jury to decide what evidence could be believed.
For three weeks the mixed-race jury had lived without any reports of strife in the Custom House. The jurors had been allowed out only once, under guard, to watch the annual Fireman’s Parade. They had heard more than a hundred witnesses and listened to the impassioned pleas of the lawyers to rise above race to reach a just verdict. Judge Woods had reminded them in his charge that the question to be answered was whether the defendants had deprived the victims of their constitutional rights.
The jury deliberated for almost three days. Its verdict was only somewhat surprising. One man, Alfred Lewis, had been acquitted outright. The jury could not reach a verdict for the other defendants, although it was later revealed that a majority had voted for acquittal.
Judge Woods declared a mistrial. He stated that the retrial would begin as quickly as possible but then infuriated the prisoners’ supporters by refusing to grant bail. Hundreds of businesses and as many as a thousand people signed a petition to the judge, but he would not budge. If he let them loose, he feared, they would fade into the countryside and never be seen again.
The defense’s propaganda campaign and fundraising efforts resumed, as did attempts to intimidate witnesses.
The retrial was filed under a different name, a name destined to become part of judicial history, US v. Cruikshank. Under a quirk in the law, the defense requested that a second judge join Judge Woods on the bench—and the man they requested was Supreme Court Justice Joseph Bradley.
It was not an unusual request. The Judiciary Act of 1789 had established three regional Circuit Courts and assigned Supreme Court justices to literally “ride the circuit” on horseback, hearing cases in those jurisdictions. Initially there were no Circuit Court justices. The Judiciary Act of 1869 called for a judge to be appointed to each circuit who would have the same legal powers as the Supreme Court justice overseeing it, as well as adding a ninth justice to the eight-man Supreme Court. The ninth man was Joseph Bradley.
Judge Bradley was a brilliant, widely respected jurist who had specialized in patent and railroad law. He was known for amassing a 16,000-volume library, his ability to read Hebrew and hieroglyphics, and his mastery of the law. The defense might have been heartened by his ruling in an 1845 New Jersey case defending slavery, his publicly stated opinions opposing abolition and his vote to overturn the state’s slaughterhouse law. He accepted the invitation to hear this case, fully aware of potential constitutional issues, and was on the bench as the second trial began on May 18.
As with the first trial, the two sides sparred over the composition of the jury pool. This jury again included nine white men, but two of the remaining three members identified themselves as mulatto, causing the Republican to state there was only one Black man on the jury.
As soon as the jury was selected Marr asked for a ruling on his motion to quash several indictments “as it related to proceedings which might flow out of the trial, for determination in the Supreme Court.” Justice Bradley, rather than rejecting that request, simply said the trial would proceed. Any determination on that motion would be made after the trial, and only if the defendants were found guilty.
The second trial proceeded much as the first. Victims and eyewitnesses described the shootings and executions that resulted in hundreds of dead and wounded. The defense contended the men in Colfax refused an offer of a peaceful resolution and started the fight. Each of the major newspapers in the city reported events in the manner most likely to satisfy and, at times, inflame their readers’ loyalties. For example, on its front page the Republican wrote, “Gilbert Noble, an aged man, is a new witness for the United States. He was badly wounded at the massacre and his wounds received over a year ago are still apparent. In fact one on his head is still suppurating. In his evidence he gave details of the fight, fully confirming the horrible statements made by the others who were nearly murdered at Colfax.”
The Picayune, on its eighth and last page, reported, “Gilbert Noble, a very old and very black Negro as called first on the stand and testified: I live several miles from Colfax. There was a great deal of excitement around. I thought it best to go to Colfax and fight for my country. I was there the day of the fight. I fought in the breastworks and afterwards retired into the courthouse. When that was set on fire I rushed out. The white men fired on me. I was wounded in several places. (Here the witness exhibited his wounds.)”
Not surprisingly, the appearances of defense witnesses were treated with equal bias. The Picayune reported that Elzine Dubois testified that she had seen Lemoine and Gibbons all Easter Sunday at L’Artigo.
But according to the Republican, Dubois “attempted to prove the alibi for Lemoine and Gibbons; she does not attend ‘American’ churches but occasionally does the ‘French’ church; when asked the difference between the two she could not tell.”
The Picayune wrote that M. Lerno, who was aboard a riverboat, saw frequent drilling at Colfax and the day before the fight had carried Eli Flowers, a leader of the defenders who was leaving the town because, he told Lerno, “they were afraid of the n——s, that if they knew they had run away from Colfax they would kill them.”
The same man, who somehow became N. Delerno in the Republican, “saw Ward drilling...men in Colfax,” and testified Flowers told him, “things were too hot for him in Colfax.”
By the end of the trial the newspapers had presented such slanted reports that supporters of both sides were confident of victory.
But as a reminder to its readers how little the situation had changed in the year and a half since the election, while the jury was busy deliberating, a front-page Picayune headline welcomed “Governor McEnery” upon his return from Washington. He was greeted by several hundred cheering friends and supporters who blocked the streets. In a blatantly racist speech, he urged his followers to organize and “fight for the white people now.”
It took the jury a full day to reach its verdicts. Apparently Judge Woods passed much of the day in his chambers playing the popular card game setback euchre with Governor Kellogg.
Given the composition of the jury—and the personal danger they faced—there was a widespread belief the accused would be acquitted—if the jury was able to reach a verdict. The fact that it arrived at a verdict in a day seemed to be good news for the defense. As the courtroom filled on the night of June 10, the prisoners were described as “looking in very bad condition. The heat and the unhealthiness of their cells in the Parish Prison, the nervous suffering during the long trial...seemed to have broken them down entirely.”
The courtroom had filled quickly, many of the spectators prepared to celebrate the expected acquittal. “Gentlemen,” Judge Woods asked, “have you agreed upon a verdict?”
The courtroom was absolutely silent. The foreman, McKee, responded that it had, but apparently he was too overcome with emotion or nervousness to read it, so he passed it to another juror.
William Cruikshank, William Irwin and John P. Hadnot were found “guilty of combining and conspiring on the first sixteen counts and we recommend them to the mercy of the court.”
The courtroom exploded with shock. Furious spectators began screaming; it was an “injustice,” “a folly.” But the evidence supported the verdict: the prisoners had conspired and banded together to prevent the peaceable assembly...to prevent their voting, bearing arms, and generally taking away the victims’ rights.
No one was found guilty of any murder, however.
The other defendants were acquitted—but Beckwith announced he intended to proceed to try those men for killing William Williams at Colfax. The three convicted men faced $1,000 in fines and as long as ten years in prison. The other men were released on $10,000 bond.
Lost in the excitement was an announcement from Judge Woods that he had wired news of the decision to Judge Bradley. Bradley had left the city before the verdict was announced, but at the beginning of the trial, he had committed to considering a defense motion to dismiss several of the indictments as unconstitutional should any defendants be convicted. Now he would have to come through with that promise.
In the meantime, supporters of the convicted prisoners were irate. Several newspapers printed the names of the jurors. The Picayune found it “remarkable that [the three men] should be convicted of offenses which, according to all accounts, they did not commit.” The Bulletin suggested the prisoners had been “hunted down like wild beasts” and dragged down to the city, and as a reward for this “infamous outrage” Beckwith probably would be handed a judgeship and Judge Woods might be elevated to the Supreme Court.
On a blistering hot day two weeks later Judge Bradley returned to New Orleans to render his opinion. Sitting next to Judge Woods he explained patiently why none of the sixteen counts in the indictment were valid. The third count declared a conspiracy was formed to take lives without due process—well, “All murderers do this. Has the United States jurisdiction of all murderers?” The fourth, fifth and eighth were “too vague and general.” When he was done he concluded that, just as Marr had objected, “the indictment is fatally defective.”
The federal government had no jurisdiction in this case, he concluded. All the convictions were dropped.
With his carefully chosen words Judge Bradley stuck a dagger into the heart of Reconstruction. In a few minutes, the entire balance of power between the federal government and the state government was fundamentally changed. He returned to the states an enormous amount of power to interpret the application of constitutional rights. Essentially, he concluded, the federal government could not enact or prosecute laws dealing with crimes generally considered to be within the states’ rights, among them murder, robbery and assault. The immediate impact of his ruling was to free the final three prisoners, but the greater effect was to change American history for a century.
Judge Woods respectfully disagreed with that decision. He wrote his own opinion explaining his reasoning. The two judges resolved to certify their disagreement, which meant it would go to the full Supreme Court for a final determination. That would take several years, but until then Bradley’s decision had become the law.
Despite its stated simplicity the decision was a complex weave of precedent, opinion and interpretation that federal and local courts would have to unravel, but none of that mattered to supporters of the defendants. The celebrations began immediately. More than one hundred of New Orleans’s wealthiest and most prominent citizens gleefully offered to post bail for the prisoners.
Governor Kellogg recognized the racial implications of the decision; it was his belief that it established “the principle that hereafter no white man could be punished for killing a Negro.”
That belief was tested within days. The freed prisoners steamed to Colfax, where they were greeted by a large, cheering crowd which included, according to an observer, several of the unindicted men who had participated in the killing spree. A day of raucous celebration became a night of violent retribution. A group of emboldened riders, rumored to include the three Hadnot brothers, rampaged through the Black living quarters, tearing up crops and gardens, firing pistols in celebration —and warning.
At one point they encountered a Black man named Frank Foster on a road. Alone, in the dark, confronted by a group of white men who possibly had been drinking all day, Foster tried to run. His bullet-riddled body was found the next day, a dagger in his throat.
People also discovered the body of an elderly Black man named Jim Cox in the doorway of his cabin. He had been shot, and his throat was slashed. A tough new sheriff, with the support of army troops, detained two men for the murders, but when they were brought in front of Judge Register, not a single man dared speak out against them.
They knew they no longer were protected by the law.
Whatever chances that there might be at least some racial harmony in Louisiana ended with Bradley’s actions. Throughout Reconstruction there had been at least a smattering of Black Democrat and white Republican voters; there had even been men of both races on the opposing sides at Colfax. After the massacre the color line was strictly enforced.
There had been ongoing conversations for a long time about forming a new political party to fight the civil rights laws and the abuses of northern carpetbaggers, a party to represent the Southern white race. “Their career [as carpetbaggers] is ended,” warned the Shreveport Times, “and if they care for their infamous necks they had better stop their work right now... If a single hostile gun is fired between the whites and blacks, every carpet-bagger and scalawag that can be caught will in twelve hours be hanging from a limb.”
The conviction of the three Colfax killers might have been the spark that ignited the movement. But rather than a traditional political party, it became a militia-like organization consisting of elements of the Democratic party and the Knights of the White Camelia.
The White League had been founded in the spring. Its organizers, in addition to John McEnery, included Colfax defense lawyers Robert Marr and E. John Ellis. Meeting in Opelousas in late April, its officers stated flatly that all efforts at conciliation had failed, and they therefore resolved “that we recognize the necessity of union among ourselves upon one white man for each office, and we earnestly invite all white men, without regard for former party affiliation to unite with us under the banner of the White League, which alone can rescue us from dissention and defeat.”
Threats of violence were not incorporated in this charter, but no one doubted the intent. The League immediately either founded or gained control of several newspapers to spread the message. While there had been multiple white militias formed, all variations of the Klan, this was the first effort to create a regional organization with both a rural and urban presence. For many people, the Confederacy was rising again.
Newspapers spread threats and propaganda from the League. In late June the Picayune reignited fears of a Black uprising, warning on its front page, and without citing any evidence, that there was “a determination on the part of the colored people now in our city to seize the occasion of the coming Fourth of July for a grand coup on the white people to enforce their ‘civil rights’ if need be at the point of a bayonet.” The paper claimed that the mostly Black Metropolitan policemen marching in the holiday parade were planning to go into bars and restaurants and demand drinks and food. If refused they intended to break everything. If there was resistance, they were “to at once fire and kill the proprietor and as many whites as possible...” and eventually “kill all the men and keep all the women.”
They even revealed the secret signs and passwords of this organization. Members would greet each other by using their thumb to exert pressure on the other person’s thumb. They would announce themselves by rapping three times, then pausing, and rapping one more time. The answer would be the same. The danger signal was the shout “Ho! Ho!” to be acknowledged with “Hey! Hey!” And the password was “Lost oh found.”
The Republican dismissed the threat under the ironic headline “A Black League.” The story was a “canard instilled in the brain of impressionable young men... The idea that a riot could possibly occur...no one, not even the conductors of the Picayune, would entertain for a moment... It would perhaps fire the hearts of White Leaguers...” In other words, it was nonsense.
But it was effective. The threat of a coming race war proved to be a compelling recruiting tool. The White League concept spread rapidly. Large picnics were held in rural parts of the state, where white people could come together and share their dreams of a Southern revival. Men joined by the thousands. By the summer there were more than fourteen thousand members in the countryside and at least fifteen hundred in New Orleans.
In the city the League was run by Frederick Nash Ogden, who a year earlier had led the failed attempt to take over the Mechanics Institute. Members formed “clubs” and drilled regularly in private ballrooms. Former Democratic organizations became White League clubs.
Christopher Nash, whose exploits at Colfax and ability to avoid capture had made him a legendary figure, was among the leaders in the countryside. Many months after the massacre Nash still contended that he was “endeavoring to preserve peace at Colfax” by serving a warrant and, having been fired upon, “summoned a posse comitatus of citizens, both white and c——d and with these [125 in number] succeeded on Easter Sunday in dispersing the 250 rioters and preserving peace... I deemed it was necessary to preserve peace at all hazards, and therefore, I resorted to the measures taken.”
Incredibly, Democrats still supported the electoral system as the best way to choose leaders. It was not the system that they blamed but rather the people who had manipulated it. Certainly, there was a racial element to the violence; a large number of white people believed Reconstruction had gone too far. Living separately but equally was one thing—like it or not they tolerated it—but being cheated out of policymaking leadership positions was something entirely different. That no longer was acceptable.
It was their belief that they were righting an illegal wrong. The year 1874 was an election year. The Fusionists, Democrats, White Leaguers—whatever they chose to call themselves—were determined they would not be cheated again. “The white men intend to carry the State election this Fall,” wrote the Natchitoches Vindicator. “This intention is deliberate and unalterable from the fact their very existence depends on it...”
If they could not win at the polls, they would take power by force.
Fittingly, it started in Natchitoches.

It had all the trappings of justice. It was held in the magnificent second-floor courtroom in the Custom House.

They filled the courtroom and the corridors, hoping their presence would help to ensure their rights were protected.
Coincidently, the day the trial began, the Picayune reported that the fight to determine the winner of two Louisiana Congressional seats—eighteen months after the election—continued in a different courtroom. Lawyers were requesting access to the ballots, which presumably were being safeguarded in Washington. The people who held those ballots refused to produce them unless it was guaranteed that Kellogg’s people wouldn’t seize them—and Kellogg remained silent.
Judge William B. Woods presided over the Colfax trial. It was a good fit. Woods, a Union general who had fought at Vicksburg, had settled in Alabama after the war to raise cotton and practice law. Grant had appointed him to the federal bench. He was well acquainted with challenges to the Fourteenth Amendment. In a controversial ruling three years earlier, he had upheld the Enforcement Act, which in certain situations permitted the federal government to impose penalties on individuals who violated that Amendment’s protections of life, liberty, property and “equal protection of the laws.” He also had ruled in the lower court decision in the Slaughterhouse Cases that the state had violated that Amendment, a decision that the Supreme Court had overturned on appeal.
Six years after this trial, President Hayes would name him to the Supreme Court.
The trial began with the selection of a jury pool, from which the twelve-man jury would be picked. That is rarely contentious, but nothing about this trial was normal. Setting the stage for what was to come, the prosecution and defense argued over the method used to choose the pool. In a trial in which race was going to play a fundamental role, the racial makeup of the jury might well determine the outcome. It took Judge Woods two days to sort that out. It took another two days of questioning to finally seat a jury.

The jury was sequestered in the Custom House for the duration of the trial, prohibited from speaking with other people or reading newspapers.
The trial was a logistical nightmare. More than two hundred and fifty witnesses were called by both sides: most of them transported by steamboat from Grant Parish to New Orleans, put up in hotels and rooming houses and then returned home. They also had to be protected: being involved in this trial was dangerous. Seventy armed militiamen were assigned to protect trial participants. Prosecutor James Beckwith received numerous warnings and death threats. Witnesses were confronted on the streets; one witness was beaten and stabbed.
But still they came to New Orleans, raised their right hands and told of the horrors they had seen. It was a courageous act; most of these people were freed slaves, many of them had never been to New Orleans. Few, if any, had ever testified in a trial, especially in front of hundreds of Black and white spectators. And every one of them knew of the threats.

Those people “had no design to attack anyone, or be aggressive. I came to New Orleans to get Governor Kellogg to send troops to Colfax.”
Alabama Mitchell, who hobbled to the stand because his right leg had been ripped apart by shot, remembered being in the courthouse when it was set on fire. “We then hung out a paper flag and a shirt sleeve and cried out ‘Surrender.’ The white men told us to come out, we should not be hurt. Some ten or twelve had come out headed by Tillman, when the white men fired at them. I ran back and hid under the floor.” After being captured, the mob took several prisoners “in a field and commenced shooting at us. They called us out, by name, two at a time...the prisoners jumped up and ran for the woods... I ran on until I could run no longer, and then crawled into the woods: there I waited two days and night...”
Day after day the testimony continued. The killers were identified by name: Cruikshank. Penn. Irwin. Hadnot. Lemoine. Hickman. Marsh. Lewis. And more, many more.
Levi Nelson’s halting testimony was especially dramatic. He identified several of the defendants, saying, “They kept up the fight all day... Shack White held up a white leaf and asked them not to kill him; Irwin shot him down.” After escaping from the burning courthouse, “I asked if I might go; he cursed me, saying he did not come 400 miles to kill n——— for nothing...they took me and another man out to shoot us; one bullet struck me in my neck, stunning and dropping me. The other man was killed. They shot him five times... One man inside the courthouse was shot and disemboweled and he was burned up alive...”
His final words echoed through the large courtroom. “I was a voter.”
During several hours of cross-examination, the defense tried to poke holes in his story, suggesting that several brothers who were there looked alike and he might easily confuse them, asking Nelson specific questions about time and distance. In response, Nelson gave an even more detailed description of his experience that day. “The man who was taken out to be killed with me was Mac Brown; he and I were side-by-side; the man who shot us stood about fifteen feet from us; he said he was going to shoot us through our heads. When he fired we both fell. I on my face; laid there until daylight... Mac Brown yelled after he fell. The man shot him five times.”
The cross-examination failed. According to the Republican, “Had witness been in free command of language it may be that the counsel would have been confused. It was evident that Levi knew exactly what he was saying, although he had a halting way of expressing himself.”
Meekin Jones swore he had only gone to Colfax “because I could not work contented. I saw men in arms... I considered that I was unsafe when they were threatening to kill us; felt safer in Colfax than in my field because if we were together we could defend ourselves...”
Benjamin Brim, who had lost an eye when he was shot, said that he had surrendered and was sent back into the courthouse to bring out the men hiding there. They all came with him, he said, except “one under the floor said he would as soon be burned as shot down. The man who had me said he was not going to shoot me, I stepped again and my captor cocked his pistol, I turned around to look at him and the bullet struck my nose close to my eyes. I fell and laid there sometime... I was shot afterward as I lay on the ground; the bullet entered my back and passed out my side... I was on the ground, my nose full of blood, and as I blew it out they heard me and shot me again, saying, ‘That will do him.’”
Brim eventually crawled into a ditch and watched men and women searching the bodies for valuables then ransacking the Smithfield homes.
Over the course of a week, witness by witness, Beckwith revealed the entire horrific details of the massacre. Men and women marched to the witness stand and told incredible stories of murder and survival. Some of the details were heartbreaking. A woman named Anna Elzie told the court that several Black women had crept back to the town and watched silently from the bushes. Elzie was only a few yards away from her husband, and she heard him pleading for his life and watched him being shot at close range. There was nothing she could do to help him, she remembered. Crying out would have resulted in her own death.
Other women told their stories. Armed men had asked Charlotte Johnson “if I saw any men not dead.” She found her cousin’s body “in a sitting position under a pecan tree.”
The testimony was so shocking that on several days the Fusionist Picayune did not even report on the trial, although they did run a front-page story accusing the governor of granting executive clemency—a pardon—to people convicted of “heinous crimes.” The suggestion was made that money was exchanged.
The defense strategy was set out by its first witness, W. L. Richardson, who testified that the defenders at Colfax “were fully organized, had captains, sergeants and all that, and were drilled in front of the courthouse.” So rather than them being a ragtag group with limited weapons, he gave the impression this was a small militia, fully capable of fighting and ready to resist law enforcement.
The second defense witness was the town doctor, Dr. Conway, who swore that the intentions of the posse were peaceful. “Six delegates were selected to go to Colfax and try to settle the trouble; they were ordered to go unarmed and make no demonstration.” He added that Judge Rutland had sworn out an affidavit against the men who had ransacked his home. Five deputy constables were sworn in, but they were prevented from entering the town. “I saw many armed white men in Montgomery.” He finished, “They said they were armed to prevent an invasion by the n——s.”
These were dangerous men, W. B. Shakelford said, they were criminals. “Rutland’s house was pillaged; I saw trunks broken open in his yard and papers and feathers scattered all around.”
Several witnesses reinforced the claim that the men at Colfax were well organized, trained and armed. They had officers and ranks. They had two or three homemade pieces of artillery. They were determined to hold the courthouse. Sheriff Shaw, testifying for the defense, said, “They were regularly drilled... They had two cannons made of pipes: the men practiced with these. Pickets were posted...”
A man named James Terry claimed he heard several men “say that they intended, if they whipped the whites, to kill them and their children. They made several other bloodthirsty threats.”
Dangerous, threatening men: James Patton raised the hidden fears of the Santo Domingo revolution, telling the jury that Black men “were forming on every plantation; they came up to the store cursing and swearing at the white people and declaring that the country belonged to them and they would rule it.”
Several witnesses provided alibis for men who had been positively identified by prosecution witnesses. Charles Smith swore, “On Easter Sunday I was present with Gibbons and Lemoine the whole day. We were engaged in hog killing and breaking eggs. Neither of them could possibly have been at Colfax.”
Lemoine and Austin Gibbons supposedly were seen “several times that day. They were at [a town] thirteen miles from Colfax. They had been staying there for over a week.”
Arista Simms, a Black servant working for Tom Hickman, testified Hickman “did not leave the house on Easter Sunday because his wife was afraid to stay at home alone. When Mr. Hickman heard of the fight I heard him say it was a shame to kill so many...” Although minutes later a different witness testified to having seen Hickman at another man’s home.
Miss Laura Lewis swore, “My father did not leave home on Easter Sunday.”
The Picayune, which dutifully reported the details of the defense case, reminded readers that the battle had taken place “to decide a contested election...and to install as the duly elected sheriff a man who in open court declares that he was not elected,” and that the defenders at Colfax had a “fierce and unappeasable thirst for war and bloodshed...”
Whatever sympathies the jurors held, the prosecution and the defense had provided sufficient testimony to justify their perspectives. It was up to the jury to decide what evidence could be believed.
For three weeks the mixed-race jury had lived without any reports of strife in the Custom House. The jurors had been allowed out only once, under guard, to watch the annual Fireman’s Parade. They had heard more than a hundred witnesses and listened to the impassioned pleas of the lawyers to rise above race to reach a just verdict. Judge Woods had reminded them in his charge that the question to be answered was whether the defendants had deprived the victims of their constitutional rights.
The jury deliberated for almost three days. Its verdict was only somewhat surprising. One man, Alfred Lewis, had been acquitted outright. The jury could not reach a verdict for the other defendants, although it was later revealed that a majority had voted for acquittal.
Judge Woods declared a mistrial. He stated that the retrial would begin as quickly as possible but then infuriated the prisoners’ supporters by refusing to grant bail. Hundreds of businesses and as many as a thousand people signed a petition to the judge, but he would not budge. If he let them loose, he feared, they would fade into the countryside and never be seen again.
The defense’s propaganda campaign and fundraising efforts resumed, as did attempts to intimidate witnesses.
The retrial was filed under a different name, a name destined to become part of judicial history, US v. Cruikshank. Under a quirk in the law, the defense requested that a second judge join Judge Woods on the bench—and the man they requested was Supreme Court Justice Joseph Bradley.
It was not an unusual request. The Judiciary Act of 1789 had established three regional Circuit Courts and assigned Supreme Court justices to literally “ride the circuit” on horseback, hearing cases in those jurisdictions. Initially there were no Circuit Court justices. The Judiciary Act of 1869 called for a judge to be appointed to each circuit who would have the same legal powers as the Supreme Court justice overseeing it, as well as adding a ninth justice to the eight-man Supreme Court. The ninth man was Joseph Bradley.
Judge Bradley was a brilliant, widely respected jurist who had specialized in patent and railroad law. He was known for amassing a 16,000-volume library, his ability to read Hebrew and hieroglyphics, and his mastery of the law. The defense might have been heartened by his ruling in an 1845 New Jersey case defending slavery, his publicly stated opinions opposing abolition and his vote to overturn the state’s slaughterhouse law. He accepted the invitation to hear this case, fully aware of potential constitutional issues, and was on the bench as the second trial began on May 18.
As with the first trial, the two sides sparred over the composition of the jury pool. This jury again included nine white men, but two of the remaining three members identified themselves as mulatto, causing the Republican to state there was only one Black man on the jury.
As soon as the jury was selected Marr asked for a ruling on his motion to quash several indictments “as it related to proceedings which might flow out of the trial, for determination in the Supreme Court.” Justice Bradley, rather than rejecting that request, simply said the trial would proceed. Any determination on that motion would be made after the trial, and only if the defendants were found guilty.
The second trial proceeded much as the first. Victims and eyewitnesses described the shootings and executions that resulted in hundreds of dead and wounded. The defense contended the men in Colfax refused an offer of a peaceful resolution and started the fight. Each of the major newspapers in the city reported events in the manner most likely to satisfy and, at times, inflame their readers’ loyalties. For example, on its front page the Republican wrote, “Gilbert Noble, an aged man, is a new witness for the United States. He was badly wounded at the massacre and his wounds received over a year ago are still apparent. In fact one on his head is still suppurating. In his evidence he gave details of the fight, fully confirming the horrible statements made by the others who were nearly murdered at Colfax.”
The Picayune, on its eighth and last page, reported, “Gilbert Noble, a very old and very black Negro as called first on the stand and testified: I live several miles from Colfax. There was a great deal of excitement around. I thought it best to go to Colfax and fight for my country. I was there the day of the fight. I fought in the breastworks and afterwards retired into the courthouse. When that was set on fire I rushed out. The white men fired on me. I was wounded in several places. (Here the witness exhibited his wounds.)”
Not surprisingly, the appearances of defense witnesses were treated with equal bias. The Picayune reported that Elzine Dubois testified that she had seen Lemoine and Gibbons all Easter Sunday at L’Artigo.
But according to the Republican, Dubois “attempted to prove the alibi for Lemoine and Gibbons; she does not attend ‘American’ churches but occasionally does the ‘French’ church; when asked the difference between the two she could not tell.”
The Picayune wrote that M. Lerno, who was aboard a riverboat, saw frequent drilling at Colfax and the day before the fight had carried Eli Flowers, a leader of the defenders who was leaving the town because, he told Lerno, “they were afraid of the n——s, that if they knew they had run away from Colfax they would kill them.”
The same man, who somehow became N. Delerno in the Republican, “saw Ward drilling...men in Colfax,” and testified Flowers told him, “things were too hot for him in Colfax.”
By the end of the trial the newspapers had presented such slanted reports that supporters of both sides were confident of victory.
But as a reminder to its readers how little the situation had changed in the year and a half since the election, while the jury was busy deliberating, a front-page Picayune headline welcomed “Governor McEnery” upon his return from Washington. He was greeted by several hundred cheering friends and supporters who blocked the streets. In a blatantly racist speech, he urged his followers to organize and “fight for the white people now.”
It took the jury a full day to reach its verdicts. Apparently Judge Woods passed much of the day in his chambers playing the popular card game setback euchre with Governor Kellogg.
Given the composition of the jury—and the personal danger they faced—there was a widespread belief the accused would be acquitted—if the jury was able to reach a verdict. The fact that it arrived at a verdict in a day seemed to be good news for the defense. As the courtroom filled on the night of June 10, the prisoners were described as “looking in very bad condition. The heat and the unhealthiness of their cells in the Parish Prison, the nervous suffering during the long trial...seemed to have broken them down entirely.”
The courtroom had filled quickly, many of the spectators prepared to celebrate the expected acquittal. “Gentlemen,” Judge Woods asked, “have you agreed upon a verdict?”
The courtroom was absolutely silent. The foreman, McKee, responded that it had, but apparently he was too overcome with emotion or nervousness to read it, so he passed it to another juror.
William Cruikshank, William Irwin and John P. Hadnot were found “guilty of combining and conspiring on the first sixteen counts and we recommend them to the mercy of the court.”
The courtroom exploded with shock. Furious spectators began screaming; it was an “injustice,” “a folly.” But the evidence supported the verdict: the prisoners had conspired and banded together to prevent the peaceable assembly...to prevent their voting, bearing arms, and generally taking away the victims’ rights.
No one was found guilty of any murder, however.
The other defendants were acquitted—but Beckwith announced he intended to proceed to try those men for killing William Williams at Colfax. The three convicted men faced $1,000 in fines and as long as ten years in prison. The other men were released on $10,000 bond.
Lost in the excitement was an announcement from Judge Woods that he had wired news of the decision to Judge Bradley. Bradley had left the city before the verdict was announced, but at the beginning of the trial, he had committed to considering a defense motion to dismiss several of the indictments as unconstitutional should any defendants be convicted. Now he would have to come through with that promise.
In the meantime, supporters of the convicted prisoners were irate. Several newspapers printed the names of the jurors. The Picayune found it “remarkable that [the three men] should be convicted of offenses which, according to all accounts, they did not commit.” The Bulletin suggested the prisoners had been “hunted down like wild beasts” and dragged down to the city, and as a reward for this “infamous outrage” Beckwith probably would be handed a judgeship and Judge Woods might be elevated to the Supreme Court.
On a blistering hot day two weeks later Judge Bradley returned to New Orleans to render his opinion. Sitting next to Judge Woods he explained patiently why none of the sixteen counts in the indictment were valid. The third count declared a conspiracy was formed to take lives without due process—well, “All murderers do this. Has the United States jurisdiction of all murderers?” The fourth, fifth and eighth were “too vague and general.” When he was done he concluded that, just as Marr had objected, “the indictment is fatally defective.”
The federal government had no jurisdiction in this case, he concluded. All the convictions were dropped.
With his carefully chosen words Judge Bradley stuck a dagger into the heart of Reconstruction. In a few minutes, the entire balance of power between the federal government and the state government was fundamentally changed. He returned to the states an enormous amount of power to interpret the application of constitutional rights. Essentially, he concluded, the federal government could not enact or prosecute laws dealing with crimes generally considered to be within the states’ rights, among them murder, robbery and assault. The immediate impact of his ruling was to free the final three prisoners, but the greater effect was to change American history for a century.
Judge Woods respectfully disagreed with that decision. He wrote his own opinion explaining his reasoning. The two judges resolved to certify their disagreement, which meant it would go to the full Supreme Court for a final determination. That would take several years, but until then Bradley’s decision had become the law.
Despite its stated simplicity the decision was a complex weave of precedent, opinion and interpretation that federal and local courts would have to unravel, but none of that mattered to supporters of the defendants. The celebrations began immediately. More than one hundred of New Orleans’s wealthiest and most prominent citizens gleefully offered to post bail for the prisoners.
Governor Kellogg recognized the racial implications of the decision; it was his belief that it established “the principle that hereafter no white man could be punished for killing a Negro.”
That belief was tested within days. The freed prisoners steamed to Colfax, where they were greeted by a large, cheering crowd which included, according to an observer, several of the unindicted men who had participated in the killing spree. A day of raucous celebration became a night of violent retribution. A group of emboldened riders, rumored to include the three Hadnot brothers, rampaged through the Black living quarters, tearing up crops and gardens, firing pistols in celebration —and warning.
At one point they encountered a Black man named Frank Foster on a road. Alone, in the dark, confronted by a group of white men who possibly had been drinking all day, Foster tried to run. His bullet-riddled body was found the next day, a dagger in his throat.
People also discovered the body of an elderly Black man named Jim Cox in the doorway of his cabin. He had been shot, and his throat was slashed. A tough new sheriff, with the support of army troops, detained two men for the murders, but when they were brought in front of Judge Register, not a single man dared speak out against them.
They knew they no longer were protected by the law.
Whatever chances that there might be at least some racial harmony in Louisiana ended with Bradley’s actions. Throughout Reconstruction there had been at least a smattering of Black Democrat and white Republican voters; there had even been men of both races on the opposing sides at Colfax. After the massacre the color line was strictly enforced.
There had been ongoing conversations for a long time about forming a new political party to fight the civil rights laws and the abuses of northern carpetbaggers, a party to represent the Southern white race. “Their career [as carpetbaggers] is ended,” warned the Shreveport Times, “and if they care for their infamous necks they had better stop their work right now... If a single hostile gun is fired between the whites and blacks, every carpet-bagger and scalawag that can be caught will in twelve hours be hanging from a limb.”
The conviction of the three Colfax killers might have been the spark that ignited the movement. But rather than a traditional political party, it became a militia-like organization consisting of elements of the Democratic party and the Knights of the White Camelia.
The White League had been founded in the spring. Its organizers, in addition to John McEnery, included Colfax defense lawyers Robert Marr and E. John Ellis. Meeting in Opelousas in late April, its officers stated flatly that all efforts at conciliation had failed, and they therefore resolved “that we recognize the necessity of union among ourselves upon one white man for each office, and we earnestly invite all white men, without regard for former party affiliation to unite with us under the banner of the White League, which alone can rescue us from dissention and defeat.”
Threats of violence were not incorporated in this charter, but no one doubted the intent. The League immediately either founded or gained control of several newspapers to spread the message. While there had been multiple white militias formed, all variations of the Klan, this was the first effort to create a regional organization with both a rural and urban presence. For many people, the Confederacy was rising again.
Newspapers spread threats and propaganda from the League. In late June the Picayune reignited fears of a Black uprising, warning on its front page, and without citing any evidence, that there was “a determination on the part of the colored people now in our city to seize the occasion of the coming Fourth of July for a grand coup on the white people to enforce their ‘civil rights’ if need be at the point of a bayonet.” The paper claimed that the mostly Black Metropolitan policemen marching in the holiday parade were planning to go into bars and restaurants and demand drinks and food. If refused they intended to break everything. If there was resistance, they were “to at once fire and kill the proprietor and as many whites as possible...” and eventually “kill all the men and keep all the women.”
They even revealed the secret signs and passwords of this organization. Members would greet each other by using their thumb to exert pressure on the other person’s thumb. They would announce themselves by rapping three times, then pausing, and rapping one more time. The answer would be the same. The danger signal was the shout “Ho! Ho!” to be acknowledged with “Hey! Hey!” And the password was “Lost oh found.”
The Republican dismissed the threat under the ironic headline “A Black League.” The story was a “canard instilled in the brain of impressionable young men... The idea that a riot could possibly occur...no one, not even the conductors of the Picayune, would entertain for a moment... It would perhaps fire the hearts of White Leaguers...” In other words, it was nonsense.
But it was effective. The threat of a coming race war proved to be a compelling recruiting tool. The White League concept spread rapidly. Large picnics were held in rural parts of the state, where white people could come together and share their dreams of a Southern revival. Men joined by the thousands. By the summer there were more than fourteen thousand members in the countryside and at least fifteen hundred in New Orleans.
In the city the League was run by Frederick Nash Ogden, who a year earlier had led the failed attempt to take over the Mechanics Institute. Members formed “clubs” and drilled regularly in private ballrooms. Former Democratic organizations became White League clubs.
Christopher Nash, whose exploits at Colfax and ability to avoid capture had made him a legendary figure, was among the leaders in the countryside. Many months after the massacre Nash still contended that he was “endeavoring to preserve peace at Colfax” by serving a warrant and, having been fired upon, “summoned a posse comitatus of citizens, both white and c——d and with these [125 in number] succeeded on Easter Sunday in dispersing the 250 rioters and preserving peace... I deemed it was necessary to preserve peace at all hazards, and therefore, I resorted to the measures taken.”
Incredibly, Democrats still supported the electoral system as the best way to choose leaders. It was not the system that they blamed but rather the people who had manipulated it. Certainly, there was a racial element to the violence; a large number of white people believed Reconstruction had gone too far. Living separately but equally was one thing—like it or not they tolerated it—but being cheated out of policymaking leadership positions was something entirely different. That no longer was acceptable.
It was their belief that they were righting an illegal wrong. The year 1874 was an election year. The Fusionists, Democrats, White Leaguers—whatever they chose to call themselves—were determined they would not be cheated again. “The white men intend to carry the State election this Fall,” wrote the Natchitoches Vindicator. “This intention is deliberate and unalterable from the fact their very existence depends on it...”
If they could not win at the polls, they would take power by force.
Fittingly, it started in Natchitoches.









13
A scandal was spreading in New Orleans! A series of published letters revealed that President George Washington, with the assistance of Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, had overdrawn his $25,000 salary for several years. Washington, who had boldly told admirers he would accept no compensation other than reimbursement for expenses, in fact was thousands of dollars in arrears to the treasury. “He doubtless spent all he received,” it was reported, “for he had lived in almost regal pomp, riding in the streets of Philadelphia with four horses to his coach.”
The brewing scandal was a brief, amusing diversion from hard times. Governor Kellogg had reined in some of his predecessor Warmoth’s spending by imposing strict budget cuts, so services and school support already had been curtailed, while the worldwide Panic of ’73 made the economic situation far bleaker. The financial markets had been flooded with railroad bonds, and when they lost value, America’s leading bank Jay Cooke & Co. collapsed, triggering a national depression. Louisiana’s ports and cotton industry had been severely impacted, thousands of jobs disappeared, working men had their salaries cut, budgets were even further reduced. Politically, Kellogg had essentially forced a bill through the legislature giving him total power to appoint Registers of Election for the entire State—registrars who had the authority to determine who was eligible to vote, and to prevent others from voting.
To make matters worse, a yellow fever epidemic was raging through the rural Red River Valley.
People were angry and scared. They needed scapegoats.
The White League provided them. The League, which by then had become known as “the armed wing of the Democratic party,” had become increasingly active in the heat of the Louisiana summer. In mid-July four League members forced their way into the home of an immigrant named Manuel Manos, supposedly to investigate the claim that he had supplied smuggled guns to freedmen, and during the confrontation shot him to death.
About a week later in Natchitoches, Louisiana’s oldest settlement, a mob of at least seven hundred white men demanded the resignation of four Republican officials: a Black judge and a white judge, the white tax collector, and the parish attorney. They claimed they all were corrupt and that one of them had stolen “all the school money.” Judge Bouilt previously had sworn his arms would have to be cut off before he would agree to resign, but he quickly changed his mind when confronted by seven hundred determined people. Although there was no violence, a witness admitted that had Bouilt refused to sign “it would have been difficult to restrain the crowd.”
All four men immediately left the town, at least two of them traveling to the safety of New Orleans to plead with Governor Kellogg to reinstall them, even requesting he send Metropolitans to protect them. Kellogg declined.
News of the coup spread faster than the fever. “If these things can be done in Natchitoches they can be done elsewhere,” the Shreveport Times proposed. “There is scarcely a parish in the State where they cannot be done more easily...” The paper then added a far more dangerous suggestion: “There is no reason why Kellogg himself should not...be an outcast from a land he has turned into a desert.”
The message spread. Weeks later in St. Martinville, five hundred White Leaguers, led by Alcibiades DeBlanc and armed with double-barreled shotguns and rifles, forced all the parish officers to resign. Any reluctance those officials might have had disappeared one day earlier when vigilantes in nearby New Iberia lynched two Black men suspected of theft.
In Lincoln Parish, an official submitted his resignation after being informed, reported the Republican, that “an armed mob of desperate characters...lay in wait for him...with the purpose to assassinate and murder him...”
The rebellion spread. In town after town elected Republican officials and appointees—the majority of them white—were forced from office. In Bossier, Rapides, DeSoto and Caddo; in Avoyelles, Webster and Winn; in Catahoula, Richland and Grant; and in other towns and villages throughout the Red River Basin, governments were overthrown, officials fled for their lives and local white Democrats were installed in their place. Incredibly, until late August in most instances this had been accomplished by intimidation rather than actual violence. But that was about to change.
The town of Coushatta lay on the banks of the Red River, about fifty miles south of Shreveport. A majority of its residents were freedmen, but a good number of northerners had settled there after the war. The local government was led by a popular carpetbagger named Harvey Twitchell. Captain Twitchell, who had commanded Black soldiers during the war, had come to the valley as a Freedmen’s Bureau agent, married the daughter of a wealthy landowner and made his fortune. By 1871 he owned the largest plantation in the region. As a state legislator the Republican Twitchell had sponsored the creation of Red River Parish that same year. Several members of his family, including his brother, Homer, had been appointed to official positions by Governor Warmoth.
Under Twitchell’s leadership Coushatta had prospered. It had sawmills, gristmills, a cotton pickery, a machine shop and other local businesses. A courthouse and schoolhouse were built, and there were schools for both Black and white children. The levees had been strengthened. People got along. Coushatta was described as the closest thing to a settled New England town in the South. When Red River Parish was created, Coushatta was the obvious choice for its capital.
During a July 17 meeting in the Coushatta courthouse, Red River Parish White League members resolved to convince Twitchell and his supporters to voluntarily surrender their offices and leave town, although they did not immediately act on it. Twitchell responded by going to New Orleans to plead for federal troops. From the city he wrote a note to the Red River Parish sheriff, Frank Edgerton, advising him, “In case a demand is made for your resignation...be certain first that violence is to be used if you do not, and to save your life, resign.
“The Government will not allow a mob to govern the State.”
That wasn’t quite true. There was nothing Kellogg could do. In the first weeks of August, men presumed to be White Leaguers made a sustained and determined effort to prevent Black men from registering to vote. They used a variety of threats: if they registered they would lose their jobs or their land or no one would sell them supplies. They also offered bribes and promises. At the same time, they warned any man thinking about running for office as a Republican that he would be putting his life in danger.
It was just a matter of time before the threats became reality. “The incendiary teachings of the White League orators and newspapers have had their effect upon the country people,” the Republican wrote. “No matter what denials they may make now, it is too late, their followers have received their cue, are told that the Federal Government will not interfere and thus emboldened they will not stop short of human blood to accomplish their purposes.”
Like so many other horrors, these murders started with a simple argument. On August 25, White Leaguers James Williams and R. S. Jones were meeting with their Black neighbors Thomas Floyd and Dan Wynn in the village of Brownsville, about ten miles from Coushatta. Wynn apparently made it clear that he was not interested in supporting Democrats, insisting he owed his allegiance to the party of Lincoln, the party that had given him his freedom.
Not the party that had fought a war to keep him in chains.
The conversation escalated into threats. The White League later claimed that Floyd and Wynn had threatened Williams. Whatever happened, Williams quickly packed up his family and moved into Coushatta.
A night later, according to the local newspapers, four armed freedmen went to Williams’s home. Whatever their intent, the story spread that they had gone there to assassinate him. Those men searched the place, then left.
Neighbors watched them going through the house. They knew who they were; they knew their names; they knew where they lived.
Within hours the White League had organized a posse. It split into two groups, one going to Wynn’s house, the other headed to Floyd’s. They later claimed they planned to arrest them. There were several versions of what happened in the next few hours, but all of them ended the same way: one white man was shot and survived, while Floyd, Wynn and a third man who had been in Williams’s house, Tom Jones, had been shot and killed.
According to one widely published account, after Floyd was caught he pleaded, “Gentlemen, let me speak one word to my wife before you shoot me.”
To which they responded, “‘G-d d—n you, we have got no words for you to say.’ His own gun was then pressed to his head and his brains blown out by one of the white men.”
The story continued that Wynn saw Floyd being shot and fired at the intruders, wounding one of them. The vigilantes caught him and killed him.
Newspapers reported different versions of the event, but there was one fact no one could dispute: three Black men had been murdered.
Both sides raised their militias. White Leaguers were told that as many as a hundred armed Black men were gathering in Brownsville, and that they had declared they would not leave a white man, woman or child alive in the parish, or that they would kill the white men and take the women.
Several white men, led by Sheriff Edgerton, rode to Brownsville to investigate the murders and see for themselves what was happening.
They found Floyd’s body lying in a field. The sheriff attempted to calm the situation, promising Black residents the murderers would be punished and telling white men that he saw absolutely no evidence that a Black militia was gathering.
That didn’t stop newspapers from turning rumor into “facts.”
“Blacks had risen against whites and threatened extermination!”
“Coushatta is guarded by hundreds of white men, who call for help!”
“Conflict is inevitable!”
On the night of August 27, a dance party was held in Coushatta to celebrate the opening of a new brick storehouse owned by White League leader Thomas Abney. Just in case, though, all the men brought their weapons, and pickets were put out on all the roads approaching the town. As they danced into the night, there were whispers that a large number of Black men were gathering at Homer Twitchell’s place, preparing to attack the party. No one seemed troubled by the claim that this “Black uprising” was being led by a white man.
The dance ended peacefully about ten o’clock. Within minutes a scouting party set out to patrol the area. Johnny and Joe Dickson rode out to Homer Twitchell’s place. They said later they saw armed freedmen in the area. Minutes later the two brothers spotted a man walking on the road and called for him to stop. Instead, he ran into the fields. One of the Dickson boys took several shots at him.
About a half hour later, as the brothers were riding back to town, someone opened fire on them from a cotton field. Joe Dickson was hit five times, in his left arm, leg and side. His horse was also hit and took off. “In this utterly helpless condition,” it was reported, he made an extraordinary effort to save his life, somehow managing “to remain in the saddle until he grasped the reins in his right hand, and with the assistance of his teeth, checked, at length, the career of the mad brute.”
Dickson made it home in critical condition. The shooting had started.
Tom Abney spread the word: seven hundred freedmen were coming to town to kill men and rape their women.
Within hours a thousand white men raced to Coushatta, ready for the coming fight. They had come from all the surrounding parishes and from as far away as the Texas border towns. They brought their guns.
At just about the same time, people in Brownsville also were being warned: hundreds of armed white men were gathering in Coushatta. Planning on another Colfax.
In an effort to prevent bloodshed, or perhaps, as White Leaguers claimed, for their own safety, a twenty-five-member “Committee of Safety” arrested six white Republican town officials: Homer Twitchell, Sheriff Edgerton, the tax collector Dewees, parish attorney Howell, Supervisor of Registration Clark Holland and Justice of the Peace M. C. Willis. In addition, six or seven freedmen were taken into custody. All the men were held overnight in the Coushatta town jail.
With their leaders imprisoned, freedmen returned to their homes. The confrontation ended.
After a brief public show trial, during which not a bit of evidence was produced tying any of the men to an uprising, the six Republican town officials were offered a deal: in return for safe passage, resign and leave the state immediately, promising never to come back. Eventually, reluctantly, they signed the agreement. “We propose on our part to leave the State of Louisiana and surrender to the people the offices we hold, and here request an escort to protect us out of the State.”
Their only stipulation was that they would pick the men who would ride out with them. They planned to go to Shreveport, and from there into Texas.
