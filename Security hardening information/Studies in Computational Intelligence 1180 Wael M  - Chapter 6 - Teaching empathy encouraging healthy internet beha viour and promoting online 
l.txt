Chapter: 6 - Teaching empathy, encouraging healthy internet beha viour, and promoting online 
labelling [ 32]. 
Despite these efforts, preventing cyberbullying rem ains a challenge. Awareness 
programs and peer mentoring are essential, especial ly during adolescence when peer 
inﬂuence is strong. Programs should focus on precis e deﬁnitions of cyberbullying, 
ﬁrm policies, staff and parent training, and effect ive internet ﬁltering technologies 
to support students [ 30].

Studies indicate that social support can signiﬁcant ly help reduce the effects of 
cyberbullying. Unfortunately, many victims choose n ot to report these incidents and 
remain silent. This underscores the importance of d eveloping effective methods for 
detecting and ﬁltering harmful content on social me dia. Techniques such as Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)  are essential for identifying 
and addressing cyberbullying and supporting victims  [33]. Recent advances in Arabic 
sentiment analysis bring new opportunities for impr oving cyberbullying detection 
systems and furthering research in this critical ﬁe ld [34]. 
Since cyberbullying is fundamentally a classiﬁcatio n problem (determining 
whether an instance is offensive or non-offensive),  this study employs several super-
vised learning algorithms to enhance classiﬁcation accuracy and performance in 
detecting cyberbullying on social media, particular ly on Twitter. The classiﬁers used 
in this study are detailed in the following section . 
3 Methods 
In our methodology, we have developed a machine lea rning models to detect Arabic 
cyberbullying tweets, as shown in Fig. 1. The methodology involves the following 
steps: (1) data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3)  extraction of different scenarios, (4) 
feature extraction, (5) classiﬁcations, and (6) eva luation metrics.

3.1 Data Collection 
It is essential to build Natural Language Processin g (NLP) models to detect cyberbul-
lying and collect relevant data, primarily from pla tforms like Twitter, where cyber-
bullying occurs multiple times. The model’s robustn ess depends on the quality and 
variety of the data collected. Data is typically so urced from social media platforms 
like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, alth ough Twitter was the main focus 
here. 
The collected data consists of text content such as  comments, posts, and messages, 
which may contain offensive or abusive language. In  addition to the text, metadata 
such as user proﬁles, timestamps, and other metrics  (e.g., retweets, likes) gathered 
to provide extra context. For machine learning purp oses, the data labelling by using 
pre-labelled datasets. These labels often include c ategories like hate speech, personal 
attacks, or derogatory remarks. Before the data is input into the model, it needs to 
go through a process of cleaning and normalization,  as illustrated in Fig.
