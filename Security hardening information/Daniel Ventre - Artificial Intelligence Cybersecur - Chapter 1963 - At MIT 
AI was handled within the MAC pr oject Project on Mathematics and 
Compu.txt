Along with university teams, the RAND Corporation also played a 
central role in the emergence of AI in the United States. Willis H. Ware’s 
book, RAND and the Information Evolution  [ W A R  0 8 ] ,  i s  a n  i n v a l u a b l e  
resource for understanding the role the organization played in the 
development of AI in the United States as early as the 1960s. The book 
covers the period 1946–2008, which is  divided into two periods, one from 
1946 to 1983, during which research within the agency was organized into 
departments, before RAND reorganized itself around programmatic actions.  
In 1963, Ware recalls, of the 20 contri butions that comprise the first book 
on AI, published by Feigenbaum and Feldman, six were written by RAND 
researchers. The initial work of Allen Newell and Cliff Shaw, both RAND 
scholars, in collaboration with Herbert Simon (Carnegie Institute of 
Technology) laid several foundations fo r AI research on learning, proof of 
theories and knowledge representation, am ong other ideas. Ware also reminds 
us that AI work does not develop in isolation. Their researchers built on 
advances in computer science, including intensive uses of new computers 
such as JOHNNIAC, until the mid-1960s. AI research draws on advances in 
computer science and many other disciplines.  
The history of AI may seem America-centric. But we cannot forget that 
work in robotics and computer science , in an attempt to understand how the 
brain works, all converging on AI, mobilized researchers well beyond the 
North American sphere at the same time.  
In the United Kingdom, Grey Walter’s research, as early as the 1940s, 
became part of this international acade mic movement which was interested in 
the modeling of brain processes and th e definition of intelligence. Grey 
Walter designed the “turtles” in Bristol in  1947, considered to be the first 
autonomous electronic robots (Luce Langevin describes the 1950s as a 
period when an “electronic animal me nagerie” was built) [LAN 69]. These 
approaches were underpinned by the belie f in a strong resemblance between 
the brain and the machine: “Physiologi sts admit as a working hypothesis that 
the functioning of the brain is that of a machine” [ASH 51].

Today’s international competition between major powers is not unrelated 
to the history of research and early development from the 1950s to the 
1960s. China and Russia, in particular, did not wait until the 2000s or 2010s 
to invest in the field of AI research . Their present activity in this area is 
based on a model which, as in the c ase of the United States, is several 
decades old.
