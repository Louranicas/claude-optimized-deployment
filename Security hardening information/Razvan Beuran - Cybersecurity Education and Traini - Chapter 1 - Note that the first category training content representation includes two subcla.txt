Note that the first category, training content representation, includes two subclasses, training definition and sandbox definition. For clarity, we have shown in the table the information separated by class, having a total of four main elements. For each criterion class, criteria are further grouped based on their scope, and we show that information as well in the table, along with the number of criteria for each case.Table 13.1Overview of the capability assessment criteriaCriterion classCriterion groupCountTraining Definition (TD)Functional6Usability6Total12Sandbox Definition (SD)Functional7Usability6Total13Environment Management (EM)Functional5Performance3Usability5Total13 Activity Facilitation (AF)Pretraining setup6Training execution12Post-training assessment2Total20Total number of criteria58
13.2.2.1 Training Content RepresentationThe training content representation category of assessment criteria refers to those characteristics and features of cybersecurity training platforms that are related to the following two aspects:The manner in which the tasks that the participants must solve are represented, for which the term training definition (TD) is employed.The description of the network environment that must be used to solve the above tasks, for which the term sandbox definition (SD) is used.
We note at this point that the order in which the two classes, TD and SD, are presented in the capability assessment tool is the opposite from that we use here, with SD criteria being defined first in the tool. Nevertheless, the order of the classes is not important during the actual assessment procedure, and we prefer to introduce the training definition criteria first, as this matches the order in which the related concepts were discussed in this book.Training Definition Criteria There are 12 criteria in total in the training definition class, which are organized logically into two groups based on their scope:Functional capabilities: Criteria related to the functionality provided via training definitions, which includes supported training types, how to structure the training, supported types of questions and answers, etc. (TD-1 through TD-6).Usability capabilities: Criteria that refer to the usability of the training definitions, including the creation of the definitions, their representation and validation, the availability of documentation, etc. (TD-7 through TD-12).
Figure 13.1 depicts the full description of the assessment criteria TD-1 through TD-3 as an example. Note the clear explanations that are included to support the assessment process. We remark that for all the criteria in this example, two alternatives are provided for Level 1 capability, and supporting both alternatives is considered to denote a Level 2 capability."The image is a checklist detailing training definitions across three categories: types of training, structuring of tasks, and types of questions.
