8.5 Proposed Approach
The research methodology involved a detailed examination of the performance of IDS utilizing the mentioned ML algorithms. The execution of this methodology was conducted using the Jupyter Notebook software. The stages encompassed in this process are outlined as follows:

The preprocessing commenced with the NSL‐KDD dataset, which involved employing the Min–Max scaling technique. The normalization technique facilitates the scaling of data within a predefined range by utilizing the minimum and maximum values of each feature.
Subsequently, a chi‐square test was conducted on the pre‐processed data to perform feature selection. This step leads to the identification of the top 10 features from the original set of 41 features.
To assess performance, the study selected Random Forest, SVM, gradient boosting, kNN, and DBSCAN algorithms. The accuracy of each algorithm was evaluated initially using all available features and then with the top 10 selected features.

S. No
Feature
Description  


1
Service
Refers to the category of network service linked with the network connection 

2
Flag
The status of the network connection (e.g., SYN, ACK, RST) 

3
Logged_in
Indicates whether a user is presently authenticated and logged into the system 

4
serror_rate
Characterizes the proportion of connections experiencing SYN errors 

5
srv_serror_rate
Signifies the percentage of connections to the same service encountering SYN errors 

6
same_srv_rate
Illustrates the percentage of connections directed toward the identical service 

7
dst_host_srv_count
Quantifies the number of connections to the same service on the target host 

8
dst_host_same_srv_rate
Depicts the percentage of connections to the same service on the destination host 

9
dst_host_serror_rate
Communicates the percentage of connections to the destination host encountering SYN errors 

10
dst_host_srv_serror_rate
Characterizes the percentage of connections to the same service on the destination host that experience SYN errors   

In addition to accuracy, precision and recall values were also computed for the aforementioned algorithms. The resulting precision and recall metrics were then compared.

The analysis of these outcomes gave insights into the efficacy and appropriateness of various ML methods for bolstering intrusion detection capabilities.
Description of the selected features is summarized as follows in Table 8.
