Chapter: 6 - Support Vector Machine (SVM) : SVM is a widely used classiﬁcation model 
that ﬁnds the best boundary, or “hyperplane,” to se parate data points into 
different categories. In natural language processin g (NLP), SVMs are useful 
for text classiﬁcation tasks like spam detection, s entiment analysis, and docu-
ment categorization. They work well with high-dimen sional data, such as word 
vectors, and can be adapted for binary and multi-cl ass classiﬁcation. SVMs can 
also utilize various kernel functions to handle com plex data relationships [ 47].
