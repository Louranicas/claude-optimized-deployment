# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Andrey Sadovykh (editor), Dragos Truscan (editor), Wissam Mallou - CyberSecurity in a DevOps Environment_ From Requirements to Monitoring (2023, Springer) - libgen.li
Chapter: 3 - “Interactive Application Security Testing with Hybrid Fuzzing and Statistical 
Estimators” introduces an approach that automates the assessment of static analysis results using fuzzing to enable the analysis of large-scale projects. The 
approach allows one to explore code sections that are typically difﬁcult for traditional fuzzers to reach.
Preface ix
Part III: Protection at Operations 
Protection at operation involves implementing various techniques to enhance 
security and mitigate risks in real-time environments. Intrusion detection and anomaly detection are crucial components of protection at operations, aimed at 
identifying unauthorized or abnormal activities that may indicate security threats. These detection mechanisms utilize techniques such as complex event processing, which involves analyzing and correlating events in real time to identify patterns and 
detect potential threats. Additionally, the concept of explainability plays a vital role in protection at operation by providing insights into the decision-making process of detection algorithms, helping security professionals understand and interpret the 
results. The combination of intrusion detection, anomaly detection, complex event processing, and explainability contributes to a comprehensive approach to ensure robust protection in operational environments:
