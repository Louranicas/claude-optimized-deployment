will guide you through the application of Bash scripting in web application pentesting.
    

     As web applications are often key targets due to their accessibility and potential vulnerabilities, this chapter will focus on various techniques to identify, exploit, and document security weaknesses in web applications using Bash and
    


      related tools.

     Web Application Pentesting with Bash
    



     This chapter explores how to use Bash for web application pentesting.
    

     We’ll look at how Bash’s flexibility can help you find vulnerabilities, automate tasks, analyze responses, and manage web data.
    

     By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to use Bash to discover and exploit common web vulnerabilities, extract data efficiently, and integrate with other pentesting tools for a thorough
    


      web assessment.
     




     There are generally five use cases for testing web
    


      application security:
     





      Testing a single web application
     


       in depth
      




      Quickly testing (automated scanning) many web applications during a
     


       network pentest
      




      Creating scripts to fuzz
     


       for vulnerabilities
      




      Creating
     


       proof-of-concept
      


      (
     



        PoC
       




       ) exploits
      





       Continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment
      


      (
     



        CI/CD
       




       ) testing
      





     This chapter focuses on the second, third, and fourth use cases.
    

     If I were testing in the first use case, I would prefer browser proxies such as
    


      ZED Attack Proxy
     


     (
    


      https://www.zaproxy.org
     


     ), also known as
    


      ZAP
     


     , or Burp Suite (
    


      https://portswigger.net/burp
     


     ).
    

     These tools enable a tester to thoroughly explore an application.
    

     In the case of ZAP, it does allow you to run the tool in a Bash terminal without showing the
    


      graphical user interface
     


     (
    


      GUI
     


     ) to automate scanning.
    

     I’ll be showing how to use ZAP in the terminal later in
    


      this chapter.
     




     In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following
    


      main topics:
     





      Automating HTTP requests
     


       in Bash
      




      Analyzing web application security
     


       with Bash
      




      Learning advanced data
     


       manipulation techniques
      







     Technical requirements
    



     The first prerequisite is that you started reading from
