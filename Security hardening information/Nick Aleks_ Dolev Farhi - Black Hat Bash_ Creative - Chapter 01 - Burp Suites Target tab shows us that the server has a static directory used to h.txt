Burp Suite’s Target tab shows us that the server has a /static directory used to host permanent assets like the hero.png image, as shown in Figure 6-10. Targeting this static directory would be a good way to detect whether the server is vulnerable to directory traversal upload attacks.

NOTE

If you can’t see images under the /static directory, click the Filter bar below the Site Map tab, then click Show All.
In Burp Suite Repeater, we’ll include a relative path to the /static directory in the filename of the python-webshell-check.py file. Rename it to ../static/python-webshell-check.py, then send the request to the server. According to the response, the file should have been successfully uploaded. Browse to the /static/python-webshell-check.py URL to verify this.


Uploading Malicious Payloads
Now that we know we can exploit a directory traversal vulnerability, let’s stage a malicious app.py payload. We’ll use the @app.route() function to include a new web shell endpoint in p-web-
