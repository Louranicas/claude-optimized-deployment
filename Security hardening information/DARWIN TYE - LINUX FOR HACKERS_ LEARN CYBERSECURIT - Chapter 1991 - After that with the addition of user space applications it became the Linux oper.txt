Chapter: 1991 - After that, with the addition of user space applications, it became the Linux operating system.
Strictly speaking, Linux is just the operating system kernel itself. The term "Linux kernel" is usually used to express this. Linux is often used to refer to a complete operating system based on the Linux kernel, which includes GUI components and many other utilities.
The GNU General Public License (most commonly called as GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license agreement. Originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU project, the GPL gives the definition of free software for computer programs. Any product derived from GPL software must be released under the GPL license and the source code must be disclosed.
Linux is the most famous example of the development of free software and open source software. As long as they follow the GNU GPL, any individual and organization can freely use all the underlying source code of Linux, and can also freely modify and redistribute it. With the rapid development of the Linux operating system, various integrated open source software and utility tools on Linux have also been applied and popularized. Therefore, Linux has also become synonymous with open source software. Red Hat Linux is one of the famous Linux operating systems that commercialized its tools to be sold for enterprises looking out a database administration system.
The development of Linux in the server field
With the increasing influence of open source software worldwide, the Linux server operating systems has occupied more and more market shares in the server operating system market structure and has conventionally formed a situation of large-scale market applications, and has maintained a rapid Growth rates, especially in key national areas such as government, finance, agriculture, transportation, and telecommunications. In addition, considering the rapid growth of Linux and the support of relevant national policies in different countries, Linux server products are bound to impact the larger server market.
According to statistics from authoritative departments, Linux currently has a 75% market share in the server field. At the same time, the rapid rise of Linux in the server market has attracted great attention from the global IT industry and has become the backbone of the server operating system field with a strong momentum.
Development of Linux in the desktop field
In recent years, especially in the technological market, the development trend of Linux desktop operating system is very rapid. The Linux desktop operating system launched by local system software vendors such as the winning Red Flag Linux, Deepin Linux, etc., has been widely used in the government, enterprises, OEM and other fields.
In addition, SUSE and Ubuntu have also launched Linux-based desktop systems, especially Ubuntu Linux, which has accumulated a large number of community users. However, from the perspective of the overall functions and performance of the system, there is still a certain gap between the Linux desktop system and the Windows series, mainly in terms of system ease of use, system management, software and hardware compatibility, and software richness. macOS is also popular among designers, creative professional in films and people who write books. Linux has a purpose and serve it well. So, does the other operating systems. As a hacker it is mandatory to understand the importance of Linux as it maybe hard to crack any system using windows and Mac software.
In the next section, we will talk about the development of Linux in various fields using a set of examples. Follow along!
The development of Linux in the mobile embedded field
Linux's low cost, powerful customization features, and good portability have made Linux widely used in embedded systems. At present, Linux has been widely being used in mobile phones, tablet computers, routers, TVs, and electronic game consoles. The Android operating system widely used on mobile devices is created on top of the Linux kernel. At present, Android has become the world's most popular smartphone operating system crossing the much hyped iOS operating system. According to the latest statistics from authoritative departments in 2015, the global market share of Android operating system has reached 84.6%.
In addition, Cisco has also used customized Linux in network firewalls and routers, and AWS Cloud has also developed a Linux-based operating system which can be used on smart phones, tablets and Internet TVs. Common digital video recorders, Stage lighting control systems are gradually adopting customized versions of Linux to achieve, and all this is due to the power of Linux and open source. Linux is no where near to get extinct. It will spread readily across every corner in the world.
Development of Linux in the field of cloud computing/big data
The rapid development of the Internet industry has promoted the formation and rapid development of cloud computing and big data industries. As a platform based on open source software, Linux occupies the core advantage of cloud computing and big data.
According to the Linux Foundation's research, 86% of enterprises have used the Linux operating system to build cloud computing and big data platforms. At present, Linux has begun to replace UNIX as the most popular cloud computing and big data platform operating system.
In the next chapter, we will provide details about different Linux distros to help readers chose the operating system of their choice. Choosing a Linux distro is always an overwhelming challenge. To know what is best for you we suggest to experiment with different distros to find what you really like.
There are so many Linux distributions that no one can give an accurate figure, but one thing is certain, Linux is becoming more and more popular. Faced with so many Linux distributions, beginners who plan to switch from other systems to Linux systems may be confused. Even loyal Linux users do not have the time and energy to try them one by one. Therefore, before beginners learn Linux, they need to have a clear direction. It is very important to choose a Linux system that suits them. The following next chapter is a classified introduction of Linux distributions.

Chapter Two



Chosing a Linux Distro





The previous chapter
 has been a good introduction to the importance and philosophy of Linux as an operating system. There are many Linux distros at present and it can be an overwhelming task to select that one perfect distro. Even professionals struggle to maintain or use one Distro consistently. As far was we say, using a Linux distro that perfectly supports your preferences is best way. There may be popular ones but they will not please you until you know what you want.
Here are some common Linux distributions:

Red Hat Linux

Red Hat Linux is the earliest personal version of Linux released by Red Hat. Its 1.0 version was released on November 3,
