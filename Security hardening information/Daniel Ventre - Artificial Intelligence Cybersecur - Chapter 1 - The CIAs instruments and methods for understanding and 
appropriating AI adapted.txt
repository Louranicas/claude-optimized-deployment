Chapter: 1 - The CIA’s instruments and methods for understanding and 
appropriating AI adapted to its needs 
The observations formulated by the intelligence community, indeed both the 
defense and the intelligence communities, were strongly marked in the early 
1980s by a trend aimed at developing an d experimenting with smart computer 
systems for data processi ng [ECK 84]. Defense and intelligence officials 
observed an imbalance between, on the one hand, an ever-growing mass of data 
and, on the other hand, human resources that are or will inevitably be 
overwhelmed by the task. The AI perspective emerged as a source of possible 
solutions to what was a managerial challenge and not yet essentially a security 
issue. The option of reversing the tr end by reducing the volume of data 
collected, produced or provided to analysts was not considered. The only 
scenario is that of increasing data  volumes, accelerating data flows and 
overwhelming human capacity with a system of machines that needs to be 
compensated for: 
“A central objective of Artificial Intelligence is to enable 
computers to emulate the intellectual functions that humans 
employ in analyzing and interpreting data. For these reasons the 
Intelligence Community is inter ested in assessing the potential 
of artificial intelligence as a technological key to computer-
based smart systems for intelligence applications.” [ECK 84] 
The particular interest in AI in th e early 1980s was part of a special 
framework, a key moment in the history of the CIA, which partly recovered 
budgets it had lost over the previous decade. This renewal of means allowed 
the agency to envisage a new phase of growth, to recruit, to develop its 
activities, to widen its field of expertise and to increase its productivity and 
research activities: 
30     Artificial Intelligence,  Cybersecurity and Cyber Defense 
“The last four years have seen remarkable growth in the 
Intelligence Community’s budget […] it has enabled us to  
restore many of the capabilities that we lost in 1970s […]  
In the last four years, we in the CIA for the first time  
have developed and implemented a comprehensive research 
program covering a staggering number of countries and issues […] 
we have rebuilt our human intelligence capability […] On the 
technical side, investments in ne w technical systems are beginning 
to pay off.” [DDI 84] 
This modernization would increase data collection capacity, which would 
result in new analytical needs: 
“This means a tremendous increa se in the quality and precision 
of intelligence information we can collect. It also means that the 
volume of data will substantially increase. This suggests that we 
must begin to invest in processing systems to match our 
capability in collecting raw data  […] We have to avoid being 
overwhelmed by this volume of information from all sources, 
and that is where developments in computers, software, and 
other new technologies really must help us.” [DDI 84] 
Although the obstacle of financial res ources seems to have been removed, 
the implementation of new systems was no less complex. One of the main 
difficulties lay in defining objectives and the appropriate methods. The low 
level of competence of the decision-ma kers (managers within the agency) 
was also pointed out, with its consequences on the choices made: 
“A serious problem for both Amer ican industry and government 
is the computer illiterate senior  manager […] important decisions 
on computers and ADP equipment are made by managers who 
hardly know a mainframe from a Mack truck. What do we do? 
We turn to the computer specialists in our own organizations who 
think narrowly and protect their turf and for whom larger scale 
planning, networking, and experime nting is anathema. And so we 
sometimes develop inadequate syst ems that can’t talk to each 
other and meet only today’s needs.” [DDI 84] 
Other particularities must be taken into account, such as the agency’s 
structure and mode of operation, which are reflected in how technological 
systems are organized and which are sometimes referred to as “problems”: 
On the Origins of Artificial Intelligence     31 
“The major problems in the use of computers at CIA revolve 
around compartmentation and security. Unlike organizations of 
similar size in the private sector, we have to have a system that 
operates on a need-to-know basis,  and that may involve only a 
handful of people.” [DDI 84] 
Security imperatives create particular constraints, which the systems must 
integrate: “We must protect ourselves at the same time against ‘hackers’ 
from the outside, and the possibility of ‘moles’ from the inside” [DDI 84].  
The CIA, in the first half of the 1980s, structured its computer system 
into five independent systems: one system for analysts, one for operations, 
one for administration, one for personnel security and one for processing and 
analyzing technical intelligence data. Each system has its own software.  
In 1983, the CIA drew up an action plan, the CIA Strategic Plan  (1983–
1993) [FIT 83], which sets out the areas that would specifically be the 
subject of an intensive development policy: AI is one of these areas, 
alongside human resources, information handling, sp ace, crisis management, 
terrorism, secret communications, clandestine information gathering, arms 
control monitoring and protecting intelligence.  
It is in this context of renewal that the agency was interested in AI (at the 
crossroads of what was then the begi nning of the second wave of AI and the 
fifth generation of computers), in which its managers place significant 
hopes: 
“We will rely on AI in expert systems applications to enable us 
to detect indicator anomalies for warning, to synthesize 
combinations of data for analysis, to scan mail to pick out 
critical messages, or to pick out gaps in our knowledge. 
Applications of AI in processing huge quantities of raw data 
without having to translate raw data into standardized formats, 
as we now do should help separate the wheat from the chaff, 
especially in SIGINT and imagery […] More sophisticated 
simulation and modeling techniques will increase our ability to 
predict alternative outcomes of future events. AI should help 
analysts compare dissimilar forms of data – imagery, SIGINT, 
regular text […] Another application might involve accessing 
more data on a real time basis, especially in crises.” [DDI 84] 
32     Artificial Intelligence,  Cybersecurity and Cyber Defense 
There are, however, voices that call for the utmost caution. In the face of 
the hopes placed in AI’s ability to profoundly transform intelligence 
capabilities, one should be aware of the long road ahead to achieve such 
achievements:  
“progress in the area of AI, in our view, is likely to be painfully 
slow. Promises of quick advances with practical applications 
should be treated with some skepticism.” [DDI 84] 
The Director of Intelligen ce (DDI), in a speech to the members of the 
Security Affairs Support Association, stressed the need for the institution to 
resist commercial pressures, marketing arguments and promise sellers: 
“I can’t tell you how many contractors have tried to sell me 
software that will enable me fl awlessly to predict the next 
action of the Soviet leadership. Until we can understand more 
about how the intuitional process works, it seems to me, it will 
be difficult to write ‘expert system software’ that can duplicate 
what analysts do.” [DDI 84] 
Skepticism is even coupled with a certain irony in the way these new 
technologies are viewed, at least an awareness of their limitations: “Today’s 
Expert Systems are ‘idiot savants’, demons trably useful in strictly circumscribed 
applications” [ECK 84]. 
Intelligence expectations of AI in 1983–1984 were quite similar to those 
of the late 2010s: detection, prediction,  raw data processing, image and signal 
processing, etc. 
We can also observe that the AI syst ems that have been developed since 
then will not have fulfilled all their promises: expert systems and other 
modalities for processing multisource data  in heterogeneous formats will not 
have made it possible to predict the end of the USSR, to anticipate and prevent 
the attacks of September 11, 2001, and many other major actions or events that 
have since marked the history of both the United States and the world.  
The attention paid by both the intelligence community and the military to 
scientific advances in the field of in telligence, however, predates the 1980s.
