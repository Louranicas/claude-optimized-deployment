Preface
In an age where the digital world increasingly shapes every aspect of our lives, the threats to our cyber landscape have grown exponentially. Cyber-attacks are no longer isolated incidents; they have evolved into sophisticated, coordinated efforts capable of disrupting entire industries and governments. As technology progresses, the methods used by malicious actors also increase. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both new challenges and unprecedented opportunities in the field of cybersecurity and digital forensics. This book, Digital Defence: Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, explores how AI-driven technologies are redefining the ways we protect and investigate the digital world. By exploring the cutting-edge advancements in AI technology and strategies, we aim to provide readers with a deep understanding of how AI can be harnessed to secure systems, mitigate risks, and enhance investigative processes in the fight against cybercrime.
Throughout the pages of this book, we will explore the intersection of AI and cybersecurity from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We examine how machine learning algorithms can detect threats in real time, how deep learning models are being used to uncover hidden patterns in complex datasets, and how AI tools are assisting forensic investigators in identifying evidence of digital crime. Whether you are a cybersecurity professional, a student of digital forensics, or simply someone keen to understand the future of digital defense, this book offers valuable insights into the dynamic role that AI plays in safeguarding our digital infrastructure.
