1. This step focuses on u nderstanding  the automotive threat ecosystem  which forms the 
basis of a threat detec tion, monitoring , and analysis program. This can involve 
understanding  previously executed research and exploits, and threat agents across three 
environments , namely: custo mers, enterprise, and third parties . The customer  
environment can include  deployed vehicles,  vehicle components,  workshop tools, 
software  applications , or other connected services. The enterprise environment could 
include insider threats (e.g. disgruntled employees), manufacturing, IT, and other 
operatio nal technologies  (OT) relevant to the vehicle ecosystem . Finally, the third-party 
environment covers vendors, suppliers, delivery , and products ( e.g. devices or services ).  
2. The second step is defining  your organization’s  threat intelligence requirement s across 
the ecosystem. T he goal is to understand which type of information is of interest for a 
given organization. For example, understanding requirements for i ndicators of 
compromise, tactics, and anomalous events  can help  your organization identify threats  to 
focus monitoring and better understand the threat landscape . 
3. An appropriate knowledge base can help  each organization filter down what threats are  
relevant or applicable  based on their risk profile or tolerance.  Once a company has 
identified relevant threats to monitor,  appropriate  techniques to monitor the threats can be 
refined .  
4. With accurate threat information , companies can then develop relevant cyber forensic  
analys is processes  where applicable . Results of such analysis serves as an input into the 
development of a comprehensive response strategy.  
5. Threat  information also enables companies to decide on the next course of action. Actions 
can range from providing input t o engineering teams  (e.g. design  and security 
engineering) , penetration testing teams,  vulnerability management teams, incident 
response teams , and appropriate industry partners.  
This Guide does not prescribe specific requirements for threat intelligence gathering, threat 
monitoring, threat analysis, or information organization and storage . Instead, it  describe s decision 
factors that companies  may use to determine what  is appropriate for their unique business 
environment and risk landscape . The above framework can help organizations  at different levels 
of cybersecurity capabilities to apply a structured approach to build or refine their threat detection 
and an alysis processes.  
2.2 BEST PRACTICES FOR DEFINING A THREAT DETECTION AND ANALYSIS PROCESS   
The scope  of a threat detection and analysis pro cess may encompass any relevant vehicle 
cybersecurity  threats , including  those  that originate from  both internal and external sources 
throughout design, development , and post -production processes . Choosing the appropriate threat  
scope  (which can vary  from organization to organization)  is fundament al for effective  threat 
detection and analysis . 
2.2.1 Threat Team Structure and Operating Model  
The threat team may draw upon a company’s broader vehicle focused cybersecurity team or other 
appropriate stakeholders as it creates collection requirements,  reviews intelligence, validates 
threats, and creates  actionable intel ligence analysis. The  threat t eam can potentially benefit from 
the following :

• An e xecutive level authority for the central team  responsible for vehicle related threat 
detection and an alysis  
• Access to necessary information in t he vehicle security ecosystem  
• Pre-approved and documented acti ons that may be t aken based on security events  
The threat team  may also be supported by a data science team  to analyze data from various 
sources ( e.g. diagnostic trouble codes, intrusion detection systems , telematics data, transactions, 
customer support – case analysis, text analysis , social media ). This team  can help design  and 
maintain cross -functional design and test requirements for an in -vehicle network intrusion 
detection system . The data science team may also suppor t anomaly detection  of any data that 
supports the vehicle and provide the capability to  monitor performance and correctness  of vehicle 
network communications against  design parameters.   
Components of a successful operating model for threat detection and analysis  program s may 
include effective  data collection and management processes , testing  the threat  detection  
program , and other appropriate handoff  processes.  Regardless of the process or method chosen 
by the company, there may be a need to adapt threat  detection and analysis processes based on 
the company ’s changing risk landscape.  
For example, an effective d ata collection  process  can be  based on risk. Typically , the data 
collected and stored is as detailed as required for event analysis  and may include any identified 
threat vectors  within the vehicle eco system . By collecting this data , actionable intelligence can be 
created, reviewed, and distributed to appropriate product cybersecurity engineering teams for 
structured analytic techniques including: anomaly analysis, trend analysis, signature analysis, 
heuristic/behavioral analysis, and elimination of false -positive s and false -negatives . These 
actionable f indings from the analysis of collected data  may benefit  incident response and 
vulnerability program s by: informing incident response processes, refining  vulnerability severity 
ratings, and refining  playbooks for possible incident types . 
2.2.2 Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities  
The stakeholder  roles and responsibilities to maintain and mature an effective threat detection 
and analysis process  represent a wide range of technical staff and partners across the business. 
Roles and responsibil ities in this team  may include:  
• Intelligence analysts : To execute the collection requirements plan, gather  and analyze  
intelligence, and create  timely and actionable intelligence products for decision makers . 
• Technical expert s: To provide guidance on colle ction requirements and feedback on the 
value of intelligence pro ducts.  
• Pene tration testers: To  understand the latest  attack vectors and trends of the offensive 
cybersecurity community.  
• Detection experts : To provide detection capabilities by gaining  specialized knowledge of 
the vehicle security ecosystem along with the awareness of the data and tools available 
for analyzing security events . 
Teams with roles and responsibilities within a threat detection and analysis program could 
potentially  include:  
• Information  technology  team : To identify threats to IT infrastructure that may be connected 
to the vehicle ecosystem.

• Data science team : To detect  anomal ies and provide the capability to monitor performance 
and correctness of vehicle network communication s against design parameters.  
• Connected vehicle operations team:  To identify  threats to the connected vehicle  
ecosystem  by analyzing vehicle telematics which  may includ e working with vendors to 
manage threats  to cloud -connected environments.  
• Security analys ts’ team: T o identify threats and  provide additional support such as 
research and communication with  appropriate indivi duals or groups.  
• Customer care and aftermarket teams : To detect fraud or abuse that affects the operation 
of vehicles.   
• Engineering and support  team: To bring knowledge of threat detect ion and domain specific 
vehicle  systems. This engineering support team may provide and support tools for use by 
the threat detection team for vehicle security event s and log monitoring.   
• Internal legal team : To bring regulatory and compliance perspectives  that will protect the 
organizati on. 
• External teams : Such as law enforcement  and other public authorities that can share 
threat intelligence  information  from their position as external thi rd parties.  
As appropriate,  service  level and support agreements  apply  to interactions  among  stakeholders  
and provide  documented and agreed upon timeframes for providing informatio n, feedback, data , 
and support related to the  vehicle security ecosystem.   
2.2.3 Automotive Threat Environment  
The t hreat environment can generally  be described by two  concepts , threat actor s and attack 
vector s. A person or thing (threat actor) uses different avenues (attack vectors) t o execute a 
cybersecurity attack within the vehicle ecosystem . Threats can  exploit points of data ingress and 
egress across the  vehicle ecosystem and  change throughout a vehicle or feature lifecycle.  A 
common and effective way to identify, define, and categorize thr eats is by considering the impacts 
to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) . Security  attacks that threat actors  to the vehicle 
ecosystem could carry out include : 
• Theft or exposure of data 
o Theft  or exposure  of personally identifiable information  (PII) or other sensitive data  
o Theft  or exposure  of vehicle -related data  or software  
• Physical theft or compromise  
o Unauthorized p hysical access to the interior or breaking door locks  
o Theft of vehicle parts  
o Theft of the entire vehicle  
• Manipulating vehicle controls  
o Breaking a vehicle’s immobilizer  
o Illegal manipulation of components and functions  
o Unauthorized activation  or deactivation of functionality  
o Co-opting vehicle systems  
o Loss of vehicle control  
• Threats to availability  
o Bricking veh icle systems  
o Denial of service attack  
o Ransomware  attack

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  7 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
Threat Actor : A person or entity with motivation and capability to exploit a vulnerability in the 
vehicle ecosystem . Understanding of threat actors typically includes  both capabilities and 
motivation.  This information may be incorporated directly in to both risk assessments and incident 
response processes.  Threat actors who may affect the vehicle ecosystem include:  
• Terrorist organizations  
• Malicious i nsider s 
• Cyber -criminals  
• Organized crime  group s 
• Governmental organizations  
• State sponsored attackers  and intelligence agencies  
• Vandals /prankster s/hacktivist s 
Attack Vectors:  The avenues or paths on an attack surface used to attack the vehicle ecosystem . 
Attack vectors  to the  vehicle ecosystem  may includ e: 
• Remote to vehicle  
o Adjacent   
▪ Bluetooth  
▪ Wi-Fi 
▪ Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)  
o Distant  
▪ Via back office channels  
▪ Via remote capabilities  
• Internal to vehicle  
o Standard user interface  
▪ Infotainment  
▪ USB 
o Standard programming/data interface  
o Non-standard interface  
▪ Accessing and modifying vehicle electrical systems  
2.3 BEST PRACTICES FOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE  
The purpose of threat intelligence is to know your adversary by understanding their motivation  
and how they would manifest t hemselves in your environment. Threat intelligence can go beyond 
the technical operational artifacts and  can sometimes include the economic or ideologic al drivers 
that reveal the motivation and/or priority of your adversary. This can assist with the prioritization 
of processing, communicating , or sharing of that intelligence  information both  internally and 
externally.  Components of a threat intelligence capability include : 
• Threat intelligence requirements  
• Threat intelligence sources  
• Threats and intelligence collection and  analysis   
• Internal and external i ntelligenc e sharing standards and methods

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  8 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
2.3.1 De fining  Threat Intelligence Requirements  
Definition of threat intelligence requirements allows a company  to appro priately scope the threat 
intelligence collection effort. To defin e vehicle threat  intelligence requirements , organizations may  
identify the  types of threats , threat actors , and attack  vectors  that will be subject to intelligence 
collection.  This process benefits from  collaboration with cross -functional teams to define and 
validate requirements.  
To support this collaboration , the threat team can i dentify stakeholders from cross -functional 
teams (e.g. the domain architects and engineers, business p artners, supply chain)  and i nitiate 
activities to foster relationships with SMEs to build trust and drive information sharing. 
Organizations can also d evelop an understanding  through regular discussions focused on  what 
cybersecurity threat concerns are mos t important.  
Steps to make  threat intelligence requirements beneficial typically include :  
• Documen ting intelligence requirements that can be used as an operating guideline  
• Maintaining the  threat intelligence requirements in an official repository   
• Revisin g threa t intelligence requirements and  operating guideline s at regular intervals to 
capture changes  
2.3.2 Defining  Threat Intelligence Sourc es 
An important  step in building threat intelligence includes determining  the best intelligence sources. 
These could  include internal teams , information repositories,  and public and private intelligence 
sources. Examples of t hreat intelligence sources could include:  
• Cybersecurity conferences  or summits ( e.g. BlackHat,  DEFCON , USENIX )  
• Fleet and enterprise monitoring ( e.g. remote diagnostic monitoring, service monitoring, 
and other anomaly detection initiativ es)  
• Information sharing organizations  (e.g. Auto-ISAC , CISCP ) 
• U.S. local, state, and federal  government resources  (e.g. NCIC C, DHS ICS CERT, US -
CERT )  
• International g overnment resources  (e.g. CERTs , BSI)  
• Coordinated disclosure program  or bug bounty  program  
• Dark Web or  Darknet  
o Darknet marketplaces for technology, vulnerabilities, and credentials  
o Dark Web forums  
• Open source intelligence  
o Enthusiast , technic al, and cybercriminal  
o Paste -and-code  repository sites  
o News aggregators and feeds  
o Vendors  
o Data and credential breach forums  
• Industry peers, suppliers , and partners  
• Security event and incident data   
• Reports from  employees  and social media    
• Data from s econdary extrapolation methods that could serve as impending threat 
indication

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  9 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
Teams can s hare information  to enable  a high -level understanding of those threats related to their 
work environment (e.g. trends in types of calls or inquiries  about specific t opics around safety or 
telematics systems). Additionally, w orking with technical staff can be beneficial in gaining intrinsic 
knowledge of digital communities, distribution lists, and other resources that can serve as early 
indicators of incidents, events,  research, and other intelligence.  
An organization  may also choose  to engage external partnerships  with third -party vendors for 
intelligence research program s. For example , programs  that have  high priority collection 
requirements  can benefit when the capab ility is unavailable internally,  unique search capabilities  
are required , or an organization  wants a layer  of separation from the research.  (See the Auto-
ISAC’s  Collaboration and Engagement  with Appropriate  Third Parties Best Practice  Guide for 
more information ) 
2.3.3 Threat Intelligence Collection  
Intelligence on threats is collected from se lected  and prioritized  intelligence sources  that are 
pertinent to the organization . The volume of data might  be large.  Therefore , an agreed upon 
method can be app lied to prioritize collection and analysis. The results are then used to 
differentiate the highest risk  threats , as well as  highlight any gaps in the intelligence collection.  
Steps for  analyzing  and prioritizing  intelligence typically  include:  
• Determining  applicability of the threat to your environment ( e.g. is the impacted software 
version in your ecosystem ?) 
• Identify ing the date and time of the last known threat exploit within cyber landscape  
• Determining whether  the threat has been seen in the relevant  environment  
• Document ing potential impact of the cyber threat on vehicle ecosystem throughout the 
product lifecycle  
• Identifying  potential vectors for cyber attack. ( e.g. physical access, Bluetooth, cellular)  
• Evaluating the  reliability of the data so urces from which the search criteria would generate 
results ( e.g. CAN log, diagnostic data, IDS ) 
• Considering t he capabilities and limitations of each intelligence source  (e.g. sources with 
limited capability, or restrictions to consumption or funding may i nfluence prioritization ) 
• Using n ormaliz ed nomenclature of technical systems to account for regional vernacula r, 
colloquialisms, and acronyms;  as well as foreign scripts  
• Considering t he input and contribution of technical SMEs and consumers to help ensure 
the most relevant coverage  
The results of analysis and prioritization are typically  documented in  a threat i ntelligence 
repository . Using  a common repository or documentation process enables  ease of tool integration 
and intelligence sharing. Areas of focus  for documenting intelligence into any repository include:  
• Identify and enumerat e assets : To have a heightened awareness of threats by 
characteriz ing for value and risk  
• Tag entries:  To e nable integration and analytics across tools (examples include threat 
type, adversary attribution, associations to incidents or other threats, CVE ). 
• Describe r eliability : To validate  the threat information (examples include confirmed by 
independ ent sources, pl ausible, logical ).

These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  10 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• Rate threat severity : To understand impact . Consider the capability of the 
threat/adversary, focus or persistence of the threat,  and indicator relation to the attack  
cycle ( i.e., beginning or end) . 
Organizations can leverage threat  intelligence  to detect and address  attacks  as well as enrich 
analysis during the incident response process. (See the Auto-ISAC’s  Incident Response  Best 
Practice  Guide for more information ) 
2.4 BEST PRACTICES FOR THREAT MONITORING PROCESS ES 
Appropriate processes support monitoring of sources and data for new threat s. To effectively 
create intelligence monitoring processes , organization s may define the threat areas with the most 
significant risks to the business, and then focus processes and t echniques on moni toring threat 
intelligence related to  those areas. Processes to monitor sources and gather new information  
typically are  flexible because vehicle cybersecurity risks are constantly evolving because of  
advancing vehicle technologies and an increas e in sophistication among t hreat actor s.   
Since threat intelligence monitoring for vehicle cybersecurity shares many common practices with 
enterprise cybersecurity, it can be good practice to use existing enterprise processes as an initial 
guidelin e when developing vehicl e threat monitoring techniques.  There are , however,  some  
differences between the skills and knowledge needed for vehicle threat  intelligence  monitoring  
and those needed for enterprise threat intelligence monitoring . Thus,  it is also  good practice to 
develop additional awareness and training content that is unique to each.  
2.4.1  Defining  Priorities for Monitoring  
Defined and prioritized threats provide the foundation for monitoring new threat intelligence  to 
protect the vehicle ecosystem . Once  threats are prioritized , an organization  can begin monitoring  
intelligence sources for new information on those defined and prioritized threats. This will help 
enable  effective alignment of available, and often limit ed, resources.  
Prioritizing  threats for intelligence monitoring can be informed  by analysis of an organization ’s 
threat  tolerance to  known and emerging  threats within the automotive threat environment .  When  
determining threat tolerance, organizations may use the following considerations  to evaluate and 
prioritize  intelligence topics for monitoring : 
• The i mminence of an attack by the threat (e.g. current attack,  private disclosure)   
• The s everity  of an attack by the threat  (e.g. safety impact , privacy)   
• The s cope of an attack by the threat  (e.g. single vehicle, few older vehicles,  fleet)   
• The e ase of asset explo itation by the threat  (e.g. few skills needed,  exploit  exists)   
• The o rganizational risk  the threat may pose due to  an attack  
• The f inancial risk  the threat may pose due to an attack  
• The practicability of an attack by the thre at (e.g. remote attack vector versus physical 
attack vector)  
Prioritizing threat intelligence areas and the r esulting impact severity of an attack has multiple 
increasingly granular cri teria, including:  
• If an event related to the threat intelligence could pose safety risks to customers  
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  11 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• If an event related to the threat intelligence would have impacts  onboard or offboard the 
vehicle  
• If an event related to the threat  intelligence may cause  risk of PII data leaks   
• If an event related to the threat i ntelligence would affect mobile or portal application 
features  
• The resulting number of vehicles that would be affected by an event related to the threat 
intelligence  
• The f ix time  associated with a threat  event related to the threat intelligence  
• The i ncident response  effort  associated with an event related to the threat intelligence  
• The potential legal , regulatory, or disclosure requirements   
• The resulting cost that would b e associated with an event related to the threat intelligence  
• The resulting negative p ublicity  impact  that an event related to the threat intelligence may 
cause  
2.4.2 Threat Monitoring Techniques and Approaches  
Organizations may use threat monitoring tech niques and approaches based on their risk 
tolerance and existing capabilities. If an organization does not have the capabilities to meet  their 
needs, they may also partner with another organization to collect and aggregat e relevant threat 
data.  
While colle cting threat data  and developing  monitoring techniques , organizations may  gather  
techniques and methods for how attackers are operating in the vehicle environment , as these 
discrete data points could have value.  Knowledge of known techniques , in conjunction with data 
points available to an organization ’s unique environment , may allow the security teams to build 
detecti on models.  Based on defined  priorities for threat monitoring, organizations can implement 
threat  monitoring techniques to maintain awareness of new threat  information .  
2.5 BEST PRACTICES FOR THREAT ANALYSIS  
Teams leverage the collected data for threat analysis. Threat analysis allows for the identification, 
validation, and verification  of threats . From validated threats, threat event s can be detected,  and 
response strategies to those events can be informed with threat intelligence . 
2.5.1 Threat Event Identification  
Organizations may implement  techniques to detect the presence of threats within the vehicle 
ecosystem  based on defined priorities for monitoring threats and gathered intelligence  on 
associated threats to the vehicle ecosystem . Some  techniques and approaches for threat 
identification  in the vehicle ecosystem  include:  
• Monitoring d iagnostic error codes   
• Using intrusion /anomaly  detection systems  
• Monitoring back office/SYSOPS  operations  
• Monitoring connections to the vehicle  
Similarly, techniques and approaches for threat identification within the vehicle fleet may include:  
• Logging data collected by fleet monito ring systems to a centralized repository a nd 
maintaining the data in a useable  format that is in accordance with a data retention plan   
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  12 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• Logging interactions between  back office systems used for fleet monitoring activities and 
vehicle systems t o a centralized system , with the logged data containing actions taken 
and timestamps  
• Employing data analysis  to monitor performance and compliance of in -vehicle network 
communicat ions to design parameters  
• Develop ing use cases that describe  how collected data can be used to alert on identified 
threats  
The u se of these techniques may be  facilitated by  a cross functional team approach  with 
monitoring techniques used by multiple teams and stakeholders . The overall efforts may be 
coordinated through a vehicle security operations center (VSOC). The VSOC is  typically  a 
centralized unit that deals with  vehicle  security issues on an organizational  and technical level. 
The VSOC may  monitor fo r high priority incident tickets  raised automatically by the system or by 
an individual group  using threat identific ation techniques, then escalate  the incident tickets as 
necessary. The VSOC could  assist in the escalation process (and event closures)  for identified 
threats and security events within the vehicle ecosystem by:  
• Triaging  incident tickets for technical and business impact   
• Assess ing business impact to determine priority of an incident   
• Driving  incident process escalations and comm unications for high priority incidents   
• Review ing and accept ing incident tickets and transfer ring wherever appropriate  
A common challenge faced when defining an approach and appropriate techniques for threat 
identification  is accounting  for false p ositive threat identification  and the overall effectiveness of 
the techniques against real world threats. Organizations can integrate  considerations for false 
positi ve threat identification  when designing threat monitoring tech niques. The design 
considerations may include:  
• Erring on the side of safety  and privacy  
• Being able to  perform a controlled test to verify the system s and processes are  working 
properly   
One additional consideration when implementing threat identification  technique s is how to classify 
and manage access to threat identification  solutions and products within the organization. There 
are at least t wo options for managing access to  threat identification  information . One option is to 
create one access level  for the enginee ring team , and a second  access level  for everyone else. 
Another option is to manage access  based on user level s, and then use  a “need to share” model, 
meaning the most information possible is shared . This  “need to share”  model may be  used in 
contrast to a “need to know” sharing model, which involves withholding the most information 
possible.  
2.5.2 Validation and Verification of Identified Threats  
Organizations may validate and verify threats  in different ways. Some companies may define a 
structured process to collect  data points and analyze them to validate any threats  in the vehicle 
ecosystem. Others may develop  criteria for triaging security events with the relevant IT or 
engineering teams. Some c ompanies may also consider providing escalation paths for the VSOC 
team to gather additional data if needed.   
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  13 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
Some o rganizations may  benefit from  develop ing methods for  generating security events with 
appropriate details for testing the full secu rity event detection lifecycle.  For example, organizations 
may want to have  a way to trigger a system to cause the detection systems to believe a true 
security event has occurred .  It is recommended that t esting be continuous to help ensure that 
detection systems are operating as designed.  
After security events are detected  and escalated , it is generally a good practice to track the 
lifecycle of these events.  This process  may allow for the tracking of documentation, information  
of interest , and any communications that occur as part of the security event lifecycle.  
2.5.3 Taking  Necessary Action  
Threat identification, validation , and verification allow s an organization to appropriat ely target  and 
prioritize threats that may warrant  development of response strategies. Threat response 
strategies typically leverage  internal product inventories , third-party support, and  internal teams  
responsible for  coordination  and strategy .  
Cross referencing threat intelligence with  internal  inventories of internal assets, such as hardware  
bill of materials,  software bill of materials, and V INs allow organizations to quickly identify vehicles 
affected by validated threats. A best practice is for organizations to have a thorough  asset 
inventory list that can be used to speed up process es to  identify  the root cause of potential cyber 
events and contact  appropriate  supply chain partners as  necessary. Additionally, thorough  lists 
provide organization s confidence that the potential impacts of identified and validated threats are 
reasonably understood . 
In addition to development of a thorough  inventory list, maintaining the list  is also important . Over 
time, inventory lists often beco me fragmented when project managers leave companies, resulting 
in legacy hardware and software inventories existing only on isolated spreadsheets.  
Organization s that do not have a method ology to track this information  may leverage partnerships 
to obtain strategies that have worked well for other firms. 
2.6 BEST PRACTICES FOR INFORMATION ORGANIZATION , STORAGE , AND SHARING  
Much of the information generated as a byproduct of program requirements such as definition s, 
intelligence gather ing, threat monitoring, and threat analysis is valuable to the organization, as 
well as  its threat detection and response program s. Information can be organized, stored, and 
shared appropriately to inform future decisions in the threat detection and respon se program by 
using historical trends and results.  Types  of information to organize  and store  include:  
• Threat actors  
o Name  or identifier  
o Threat actor description  
o Source of primary threat actor intelligence ( i.e., point of contact  to he lp refresh data 
periodically)  
o Observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)  
o Associated internet protocol (IP) address es and assets  
o Threat events each actor is associated with  
• Threat events  
o Affected systems  
o Affected system suppliers and product owner s

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  14 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
o Threat event r isk assessments  
o Associated references to v ulnerability management systems  
• Threat intelligence requirements  
o Source of collection requirements  
o Reference to risk  or threat that each requirement is intended  to address  
• Threat monitoring  
o Data associated with m onitoring requirements  
o Data associated with monitoring performa nce ( false positives/negatives)  
o Data associated with performance  of threat intelligence sources  
• Any associated timestamps , coordinated in a way that events from disparate systems can 
be correlated to each other  (e.g. universal time code ) 
2.6.1 Key Considerations for Information Storage  and Organization  
When defining  steps to store threat detection a nd analysis information , organizations might want 
to consider several factors such as types of data, storage  methodology , and length of period for 
storage . 
The first decision organizations could  make is how to securely store and manage access control 
to threat detection and analysi s information. Steps  for securely storing sensitive data and 
managing access control include:  
• Develop ing a process for vetting and authorizing new access requests to the data  
• Periodically audit ing the authorized individuals to help ensure their access is s till required  
• Limit ing access to the data to only those individuals that are providing updated data or 
need to query the data  
• Limit ing data modification capabilities to only those that requ ire the need to modify the 
data 
• Maintaining logs of data queries an d modifications  
• Ensuring h igh availability and disaster recovery   
• Implementing e ncryption  protocols  
• Using an i nformation classification  system  
• Giving  more recent  events priority over ol der events prior to overwriting or rollover   
• Summarizing events ( e.g. counts) prior to overwriting  or rollover   
• Implementing  controls  (e.g. digital signatures ) to protect the integrity of event data 
while  stored  onboard and offboard  
• Using  a store -and-forward approach to cope with network availability issues  
• Defining retention and backup requirements   
Following storage, information  can be organized to allow organizations and teams to effective ly 
use it. A best practice for information  organ ization is to define key process indicators  using 
available  information, and then create  dashboards and reports to enable future analysis of stored 
information . Organizations may consider integrating this information into their vulnerability 
management and incident response processes. This will enable more rapid and accurate data 
access during an incident. It also makes the collating of information more efficient if all systems 
are using the same terminolog y and object models.

2.6.2 Approaches for Internal and External Sharing  
Threat detection and analys is information  may be shared and used across the organization t o 
help ensure thorough  analysis.  Intelligence adds value when shared to assist with operation al or 
strategic decisions.  Actionable intelligence is especially useful if a threat is active. (See the Auto-
ISAC’s  Risk Assessment and  Management Best Practice Guide  for more information) . Some 
considerations for organizations when defining how and what information to s hare are : 
• How to determine if i nformation can  or should be shared  
• Approval process (if applicable) to share informatio n internally and/or  externally  that could 
include : legal, safety, communications, and in-vehicle Subject Matter Experts (SME)  
• Audiences for the typ e of information to be shared  
• Mechanisms for distribution of informati on to approved parties  
• Negotiating a  common format for sharing information in advance of sharing (e.g. tagging 
or prioritization) ( See Section 2.3.3)  
Possible  mechanisms  for internal and external sharing of information include:  
• Newsletter summari es with appropriate  email distribution published daily  or weekly  with 
special alerts as needed  
• Reoccurring staff meetings for cybersecurity stakeholders  or cross  functional staff to 
update  and exchange information  
• Dedicated  internal website or portal   
• Auto-ISAC portal   
• Chat room alerts  
• Providing  feedback to intelligence source s related to quality of intelligence received  
• Utilizing  existing corporate/organizationa l communication platforms for sharing updates  
• Incorporat ing information into training and awareness materials  
• Send ing information out to appropriate organization members on a regular cadence ( e.g. 
monthly, q uarterly) providing awareness information, indu stry updates around threats, 
information location, and communication contact points.  
Some internal stakeholders that may find intelligence valuable when shared include:  
• Customer care and aftermarket teams : Data may allow analysis of  user behavior , 
consistent with privacy policies, to prevent fraud , abuse , or exploit . 
• Joint ventures and subsidiaries : May benefit from  appropriate collection requirements and 
compartmentalization in each environment or region.  
• Legal and public relations: May benefit from compliance requirements in each 
environment or region.  
• Other internal teams:  Share awareness and knowledge (e.g. threats, suspicious chatter, 
inquiries from researchers, reverse engineering that might result  
In addition to  defin ing how an organization is going to share information, they may define how to 
properly handle such information . An organization may define  the specific data handling 
procedures that accompany certain types of data labels. Distributors of the sensitive info rmation 
should take steps to help  ensure  that those receiving any information are aware of their duty to 
protect the sensitive information.

1. This step focuses on u nderstanding  the automotive threat ecosystem  which forms the 
basis of a threat detec tion, monitoring , and analysis program. This can involve 
understanding  previously executed research and exploits, and threat agents across three 
environments , namely: custo mers, enterprise, and third parties . The customer  
environment can include  deployed vehicles,  vehicle components,  workshop tools, 
software  applications , or other connected services. The enterprise environment could 
include insider threats (e.g. disgruntled employees), manufacturing, IT, and other 
operatio nal technologies  (OT) relevant to the vehicle ecosystem . Finally, the third-party 
environment covers vendors, suppliers, delivery , and products ( e.g. devices or services ).  
2. The second step is defining  your organization’s  threat intelligence requirement s across 
the ecosystem. T he goal is to understand which type of information is of interest for a 
given organization. For example, understanding requirements for i ndicators of 
compromise, tactics, and anomalous events  can help  your organization identify threats  to 
focus monitoring and better understand the threat landscape . 
3. An appropriate knowledge base can help  each organization filter down what threats are  
relevant or applicable  based on their risk profile or tolerance.  Once a company has 
identified relevant threats to monitor,  appropriate  techniques to monitor the threats can be 
refined .  
4. With accurate threat information , companies can then develop relevant cyber forensic  
analys is processes  where applicable . Results of such analysis serves as an input into the 
development of a comprehensive response strategy.  
5. Threat  information also enables companies to decide on the next course of action. Actions 
can range from providing input t o engineering teams  (e.g. design  and security 
engineering) , penetration testing teams,  vulnerability management teams, incident 
response teams , and appropriate industry partners.  
This Guide does not prescribe specific requirements for threat intelligence gathering, threat 
monitoring, threat analysis, or information organization and storage . Instead, it  describe s decision 
factors that companies  may use to determine what  is appropriate for their unique business 
environment and risk landscape . The above framework can help organizations  at different levels 
of cybersecurity capabilities to apply a structured approach to build or refine their threat detection 
and an alysis processes.  
2.2 BEST PRACTICES FOR DEFINING A THREAT DETECTION AND ANALYSIS PROCESS   
The scope  of a threat detection and analysis pro cess may encompass any relevant vehicle 
cybersecurity  threats , including  those  that originate from  both internal and external sources 
throughout design, development , and post -production processes . Choosing the appropriate threat  
scope  (which can vary  from organization to organization)  is fundament al for effective  threat 
detection and analysis . 
2.2.1 Threat Team Structure and Operating Model  
The threat team may draw upon a company’s broader vehicle focused cybersecurity team or other 
appropriate stakeholders as it creates collection requirements,  reviews intelligence, validates 
threats, and creates  actionable intel ligence analysis. The  threat t eam can potentially benefit from 
the following : 
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  5 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• An e xecutive level authority for the central team  responsible for vehicle related threat 
detection and an alysis  
• Access to necessary information in t he vehicle security ecosystem  
• Pre-approved and documented acti ons that may be t aken based on security events  
The threat team  may also be supported by a data science team  to analyze data from various 
sources ( e.g. diagnostic trouble codes, intrusion detection systems , telematics data, transactions, 
customer support – case analysis, text analysis , social media ). This team  can help design  and 
maintain cross -functional design and test requirements for an in -vehicle network intrusion 
detection system . The data science team may also suppor t anomaly detection  of any data that 
supports the vehicle and provide the capability to  monitor performance and correctness  of vehicle 
network communications against  design parameters.   
Components of a successful operating model for threat detection and analysis  program s may 
include effective  data collection and management processes , testing  the threat  detection  
program , and other appropriate handoff  processes.  Regardless of the process or method chosen 
by the company, there may be a need to adapt threat  detection and analysis processes based on 
the company ’s changing risk landscape.  
For example, an effective d ata collection  process  can be  based on risk. Typically , the data 
collected and stored is as detailed as required for event analysis  and may include any identified 
threat vectors  within the vehicle eco system . By collecting this data , actionable intelligence can be 
created, reviewed, and distributed to appropriate product cybersecurity engineering teams for 
structured analytic techniques including: anomaly analysis, trend analysis, signature analysis, 
heuristic/behavioral analysis, and elimination of false -positive s and false -negatives . These 
actionable f indings from the analysis of collected data  may benefit  incident response and 
vulnerability program s by: informing incident response processes, refining  vulnerability severity 
ratings, and refining  playbooks for possible incident types . 
2.2.2 Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities  
The stakeholder  roles and responsibilities to maintain and mature an effective threat detection 
and analysis process  represent a wide range of technical staff and partners across the business. 
Roles and responsibil ities in this team  may include:  
• Intelligence analysts : To execute the collection requirements plan, gather  and analyze  
intelligence, and create  timely and actionable intelligence products for decision makers . 
• Technical expert s: To provide guidance on colle ction requirements and feedback on the 
value of intelligence pro ducts.  
• Pene tration testers: To  understand the latest  attack vectors and trends of the offensive 
cybersecurity community.  
• Detection experts : To provide detection capabilities by gaining  specialized knowledge of 
the vehicle security ecosystem along with the awareness of the data and tools available 
for analyzing security events . 
Teams with roles and responsibilities within a threat detection and analysis program could 
potentially  include:  
• Information  technology  team : To identify threats to IT infrastructure that may be connected 
to the vehicle ecosystem.

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  6 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• Data science team : To detect  anomal ies and provide the capability to monitor performance 
and correctness of vehicle network communication s against design parameters.  
• Connected vehicle operations team:  To identify  threats to the connected vehicle  
ecosystem  by analyzing vehicle telematics which  may includ e working with vendors to 
manage threats  to cloud -connected environments.  
• Security analys ts’ team: T o identify threats and  provide additional support such as 
research and communication with  appropriate indivi duals or groups.  
• Customer care and aftermarket teams : To detect fraud or abuse that affects the operation 
of vehicles.   
• Engineering and support  team: To bring knowledge of threat detect ion and domain specific 
vehicle  systems. This engineering support team may provide and support tools for use by 
the threat detection team for vehicle security event s and log monitoring.   
• Internal legal team : To bring regulatory and compliance perspectives  that will protect the 
organizati on. 
• External teams : Such as law enforcement  and other public authorities that can share 
threat intelligence  information  from their position as external thi rd parties.  
As appropriate,  service  level and support agreements  apply  to interactions  among  stakeholders  
and provide  documented and agreed upon timeframes for providing informatio n, feedback, data , 
and support related to the  vehicle security ecosystem.   
2.2.3 Automotive Threat Environment  
The t hreat environment can generally  be described by two  concepts , threat actor s and attack 
vector s. A person or thing (threat actor) uses different avenues (attack vectors) t o execute a 
cybersecurity attack within the vehicle ecosystem . Threats can  exploit points of data ingress and 
egress across the  vehicle ecosystem and  change throughout a vehicle or feature lifecycle.  A 
common and effective way to identify, define, and categorize thr eats is by considering the impacts 
to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) . Security  attacks that threat actors  to the vehicle 
ecosystem could carry out include : 
• Theft or exposure of data 
o Theft  or exposure  of personally identifiable information  (PII) or other sensitive data  
o Theft  or exposure  of vehicle -related data  or software  
• Physical theft or compromise  
o Unauthorized p hysical access to the interior or breaking door locks  
o Theft of vehicle parts  
o Theft of the entire vehicle  
• Manipulating vehicle controls  
o Breaking a vehicle’s immobilizer  
o Illegal manipulation of components and functions  
o Unauthorized activation  or deactivation of functionality  
o Co-opting vehicle systems  
o Loss of vehicle control  
• Threats to availability  
o Bricking veh icle systems  
o Denial of service attack  
o Ransomware  attack

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  7 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
Threat Actor : A person or entity with motivation and capability to exploit a vulnerability in the 
vehicle ecosystem . Understanding of threat actors typically includes  both capabilities and 
motivation.  This information may be incorporated directly in to both risk assessments and incident 
response processes.  Threat actors who may affect the vehicle ecosystem include:  
• Terrorist organizations  
• Malicious i nsider s 
• Cyber -criminals  
• Organized crime  group s 
• Governmental organizations  
• State sponsored attackers  and intelligence agencies  
• Vandals /prankster s/hacktivist s 
Attack Vectors:  The avenues or paths on an attack surface used to attack the vehicle ecosystem . 
Attack vectors  to the  vehicle ecosystem  may includ e: 
• Remote to vehicle  
o Adjacent   
▪ Bluetooth  
▪ Wi-Fi 
▪ Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)  
o Distant  
▪ Via back office channels  
▪ Via remote capabilities  
• Internal to vehicle  
o Standard user interface  
▪ Infotainment  
▪ USB 
o Standard programming/data interface  
o Non-standard interface  
▪ Accessing and modifying vehicle electrical systems  
2.3 BEST PRACTICES FOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE  
The purpose of threat intelligence is to know your adversary by understanding their motivation  
and how they would manifest t hemselves in your environment. Threat intelligence can go beyond 
the technical operational artifacts and  can sometimes include the economic or ideologic al drivers 
that reveal the motivation and/or priority of your adversary. This can assist with the prioritization 
of processing, communicating , or sharing of that intelligence  information both  internally and 
externally.  Components of a threat intelligence capability include : 
• Threat intelligence requirements  
• Threat intelligence sources  
• Threats and intelligence collection and  analysis   
• Internal and external i ntelligenc e sharing standards and methods  
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)

Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  8 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
2.3.1 De fining  Threat Intelligence Requirements  
Definition of threat intelligence requirements allows a company  to appro priately scope the threat 
intelligence collection effort. To defin e vehicle threat  intelligence requirements , organizations may  
identify the  types of threats , threat actors , and attack  vectors  that will be subject to intelligence 
collection.  This process benefits from  collaboration with cross -functional teams to define and 
validate requirements.  
To support this collaboration , the threat team can i dentify stakeholders from cross -functional 
teams (e.g. the domain architects and engineers, business p artners, supply chain)  and i nitiate 
activities to foster relationships with SMEs to build trust and drive information sharing. 
Organizations can also d evelop an understanding  through regular discussions focused on  what 
cybersecurity threat concerns are mos t important.  
Steps to make  threat intelligence requirements beneficial typically include :  
• Documen ting intelligence requirements that can be used as an operating guideline  
• Maintaining the  threat intelligence requirements in an official repository   
• Revisin g threa t intelligence requirements and  operating guideline s at regular intervals to 
capture changes  
2.3.2 Defining  Threat Intelligence Sourc es 
An important  step in building threat intelligence includes determining  the best intelligence sources. 
These could  include internal teams , information repositories,  and public and private intelligence 
sources. Examples of t hreat intelligence sources could include:  
• Cybersecurity conferences  or summits ( e.g. BlackHat,  DEFCON , USENIX )  
• Fleet and enterprise monitoring ( e.g. remote diagnostic monitoring, service monitoring, 
and other anomaly detection initiativ es)  
• Information sharing organizations  (e.g. Auto-ISAC , CISCP ) 
• U.S. local, state, and federal  government resources  (e.g. NCIC C, DHS ICS CERT, US -
CERT )  
• International g overnment resources  (e.g. CERTs , BSI)  
• Coordinated disclosure program  or bug bounty  program  
• Dark Web or  Darknet  
o Darknet marketplaces for technology, vulnerabilities, and credentials  
o Dark Web forums  
• Open source intelligence  
o Enthusiast , technic al, and cybercriminal  
o Paste -and-code  repository sites  
o News aggregators and feeds  
o Vendors  
o Data and credential breach forums  
• Industry peers, suppliers , and partners  
• Security event and incident data   
• Reports from  employees  and social media    
• Data from s econdary extrapolation methods that could serve as impending threat 
indication   
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  9 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
Teams can s hare information  to enable  a high -level understanding of those threats related to their 
work environment (e.g. trends in types of calls or inquiries  about specific t opics around safety or 
telematics systems). Additionally, w orking with technical staff can be beneficial in gaining intrinsic 
knowledge of digital communities, distribution lists, and other resources that can serve as early 
indicators of incidents, events,  research, and other intelligence.  
An organization  may also choose  to engage external partnerships  with third -party vendors for 
intelligence research program s. For example , programs  that have  high priority collection 
requirements  can benefit when the capab ility is unavailable internally,  unique search capabilities  
are required , or an organization  wants a layer  of separation from the research.  (See the Auto-
ISAC’s  Collaboration and Engagement  with Appropriate  Third Parties Best Practice  Guide for 
more information ) 
2.3.3 Threat Intelligence Collection  
Intelligence on threats is collected from se lected  and prioritized  intelligence sources  that are 
pertinent to the organization . The volume of data might  be large.  Therefore , an agreed upon 
method can be app lied to prioritize collection and analysis. The results are then used to 
differentiate the highest risk  threats , as well as  highlight any gaps in the intelligence collection.  
Steps for  analyzing  and prioritizing  intelligence typically  include:  
• Determining  applicability of the threat to your environment ( e.g. is the impacted software 
version in your ecosystem ?) 
• Identify ing the date and time of the last known threat exploit within cyber landscape  
• Determining whether  the threat has been seen in the relevant  environment  
• Document ing potential impact of the cyber threat on vehicle ecosystem throughout the 
product lifecycle  
• Identifying  potential vectors for cyber attack. ( e.g. physical access, Bluetooth, cellular)  
• Evaluating the  reliability of the data so urces from which the search criteria would generate 
results ( e.g. CAN log, diagnostic data, IDS ) 
• Considering t he capabilities and limitations of each intelligence source  (e.g. sources with 
limited capability, or restrictions to consumption or funding may i nfluence prioritization ) 
• Using n ormaliz ed nomenclature of technical systems to account for regional vernacula r, 
colloquialisms, and acronyms;  as well as foreign scripts  
• Considering t he input and contribution of technical SMEs and consumers to help ensure 
the most relevant coverage  
The results of analysis and prioritization are typically  documented in  a threat i ntelligence 
repository . Using  a common repository or documentation process enables  ease of tool integration 
and intelligence sharing. Areas of focus  for documenting intelligence into any repository include:  
• Identify and enumerat e assets : To have a heightened awareness of threats by 
characteriz ing for value and risk  
• Tag entries:  To e nable integration and analytics across tools (examples include threat 
type, adversary attribution, associations to incidents or other threats, CVE ). 
• Describe r eliability : To validate  the threat information (examples include confirmed by 
independ ent sources, pl ausible, logical ). 
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  10 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• Rate threat severity : To understand impact . Consider the capability of the 
threat/adversary, focus or persistence of the threat,  and indicator relation to the attack  
cycle ( i.e., beginning or end) . 
Organizations can leverage threat  intelligence  to detect and address  attacks  as well as enrich 
analysis during the incident response process. (See the Auto-ISAC’s  Incident Response  Best 
Practice  Guide for more information ) 
2.4 BEST PRACTICES FOR THREAT MONITORING PROCESS ES 
Appropriate processes support monitoring of sources and data for new threat s. To effectively 
create intelligence monitoring processes , organization s may define the threat areas with the most 
significant risks to the business, and then focus processes and t echniques on moni toring threat 
intelligence related to  those areas. Processes to monitor sources and gather new information  
typically are  flexible because vehicle cybersecurity risks are constantly evolving because of  
advancing vehicle technologies and an increas e in sophistication among t hreat actor s.   
Since threat intelligence monitoring for vehicle cybersecurity shares many common practices with 
enterprise cybersecurity, it can be good practice to use existing enterprise processes as an initial 
guidelin e when developing vehicl e threat monitoring techniques.  There are , however,  some  
differences between the skills and knowledge needed for vehicle threat  intelligence  monitoring  
and those needed for enterprise threat intelligence monitoring . Thus,  it is also  good practice to 
develop additional awareness and training content that is unique to each.  
2.4.1  Defining  Priorities for Monitoring  
Defined and prioritized threats provide the foundation for monitoring new threat intelligence  to 
protect the vehicle ecosystem . Once  threats are prioritized , an organization  can begin monitoring  
intelligence sources for new information on those defined and prioritized threats. This will help 
enable  effective alignment of available, and often limit ed, resources.  
Prioritizing  threats for intelligence monitoring can be informed  by analysis of an organization ’s 
threat  tolerance to  known and emerging  threats within the automotive threat environment .  When  
determining threat tolerance, organizations may use the following considerations  to evaluate and 
prioritize  intelligence topics for monitoring : 
• The i mminence of an attack by the threat (e.g. current attack,  private disclosure)   
• The s everity  of an attack by the threat  (e.g. safety impact , privacy)   
• The s cope of an attack by the threat  (e.g. single vehicle, few older vehicles,  fleet)   
• The e ase of asset explo itation by the threat  (e.g. few skills needed,  exploit  exists)   
• The o rganizational risk  the threat may pose due to  an attack  
• The f inancial risk  the threat may pose due to an attack  
• The practicability of an attack by the thre at (e.g. remote attack vector versus physical 
attack vector)  
Prioritizing threat intelligence areas and the r esulting impact severity of an attack has multiple 
increasingly granular cri teria, including:  
• If an event related to the threat intelligence could pose safety risks to customers  
 Traffic Light Protocol: White  (May be shared in public forums)  
This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  11 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• If an event related to the threat intelligence would have impacts  onboard or offboard the 
vehicle  
• If an event related to the threat  intelligence may cause  risk of PII data leaks   
• If an event related to the threat i ntelligence would affect mobile or portal application 
features  
• The resulting number of vehicles that would be affected by an event related to the threat 
intelligence  
• The f ix time  associated with a threat  event related to the threat intelligence  
• The i ncident response  effort  associated with an event related to the threat intelligence  
• The potential legal , regulatory, or disclosure requirements   
• The resulting cost that would b e associated with an event related to the threat intelligence  
• The resulting negative p ublicity  impact  that an event related to the threat intelligence may 
cause  
2.4.2 Threat Monitoring Techniques and Approaches  
Organizations may use threat monitoring tech niques and approaches based on their risk 
tolerance and existing capabilities. If an organization does not have the capabilities to meet  their 
needs, they may also partner with another organization to collect and aggregat e relevant threat 
data.  
While colle cting threat data  and developing  monitoring techniques , organizations may  gather  
techniques and methods for how attackers are operating in the vehicle environment , as these 
discrete data points could have value.  Knowledge of known techniques , in conjunction with data 
points available to an organization ’s unique environment , may allow the security teams to build 
detecti on models.  Based on defined  priorities for threat monitoring, organizations can implement 
threat  monitoring techniques to maintain awareness of new threat  information .  
2.5 BEST PRACTICES FOR THREAT ANALYSIS  
Teams leverage the collected data for threat analysis. Threat analysis allows for the identification, 
validation, and verification  of threats . From validated threats, threat event s can be detected,  and 
response strategies to those events can be informed with threat intelligence . 
2.5.1 Threat Event Identification  
Organizations may implement  techniques to detect the presence of threats within the vehicle 
ecosystem  based on defined priorities for monitoring threats and gathered intelligence  on 
associated threats to the vehicle ecosystem . Some  techniques and approaches for threat 
identification  in the vehicle ecosystem  include:  
• Monitoring d iagnostic error codes   
• Using intrusion /anomaly  detection systems  
• Monitoring back office/SYSOPS  operations  
• Monitoring connections to the vehicle  
Similarly, techniques and approaches for threat identification within the vehicle fleet may include:  
• Logging data collected by fleet monito ring systems to a centralized repository a nd 
maintaining the data in a useable  format that is in accordance with a data retention plan

This Guide does not prescribe or require specific technical or organizational practices.  
These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  12 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
• Logging interactions between  back office systems used for fleet monitoring activities and 
vehicle systems t o a centralized system , with the logged data containing actions taken 
and timestamps  
• Employing data analysis  to monitor performance and compliance of in -vehicle network 
communicat ions to design parameters  
• Develop ing use cases that describe  how collected data can be used to alert on identified 
threats  
The u se of these techniques may be  facilitated by  a cross functional team approach  with 
monitoring techniques used by multiple teams and stakeholders . The overall efforts may be 
coordinated through a vehicle security operations center (VSOC). The VSOC is  typically  a 
centralized unit that deals with  vehicle  security issues on an organizational  and technical level. 
The VSOC may  monitor fo r high priority incident tickets  raised automatically by the system or by 
an individual group  using threat identific ation techniques, then escalate  the incident tickets as 
necessary. The VSOC could  assist in the escalation process (and event closures)  for identified 
threats and security events within the vehicle ecosystem by:  
• Triaging  incident tickets for technical and business impact   
• Assess ing business impact to determine priority of an incident   
• Driving  incident process escalations and comm unications for high priority incidents   
• Review ing and accept ing incident tickets and transfer ring wherever appropriate  
A common challenge faced when defining an approach and appropriate techniques for threat 
identification  is accounting  for false p ositive threat identification  and the overall effectiveness of 
the techniques against real world threats. Organizations can integrate  considerations for false 
positi ve threat identification  when designing threat monitoring tech niques. The design 
considerations may include:  
• Erring on the side of safety  and privacy  
• Being able to  perform a controlled test to verify the system s and processes are  working 
properly   
One additional consideration when implementing threat identification  technique s is how to classify 
and manage access to threat identification  solutions and products within the organization. There 
are at least t wo options for managing access to  threat identification  information . One option is to 
create one access level  for the enginee ring team , and a second  access level  for everyone else. 
Another option is to manage access  based on user level s, and then use  a “need to share” model, 
meaning the most information possible is shared . This  “need to share”  model may be  used in 
contrast to a “need to know” sharing model, which involves withholding the most information 
possible.  
2.5.2 Validation and Verification of Identified Threats  
Organizations may validate and verify threats  in different ways. Some companies may define a 
structured process to collect  data points and analyze them to validate any threats  in the vehicle 
ecosystem. Others may develop  criteria for triaging security events with the relevant IT or 
engineering teams. Some c ompanies may also consider providing escalation paths for the VSOC 
team to gather additional data if needed.

These are voluntary and aspirational practices, which may evolve over time.  
Please see Section 1.2 for more information.  13 THREAT DETECTION, MO NITORING & ANALYSIS  
Some o rganizations may  benefit from  develop ing methods for  generating security events with 
appropriate details for testing the full secu rity event detection lifecycle.  For example, organizations 
may want to have  a way to trigger a system to cause the detection systems to believe a true 
security event has occurred .  It is recommended that t esting be continuous to help ensure that 
detection systems are operating as designed.  
After security events are detected  and escalated , it is generally a good practice to track the 
lifecycle of these events.  This process  may allow for the tracking of documentation, information  
of interest , and any communications that occur as part of the security event lifecycle.  
2.5.3 Taking  Necessary Action  
Threat identification, validation , and verification allow s an organization to appropriat ely target  and 
prioritize threats that may warrant  development of response strategies. Threat response 
strategies typically leverage  internal product inventories , third-party support, and  internal teams  
responsible for  coordination  and strategy .  
Cross referencing threat intelligence with  internal  inventories of internal assets, such as hardware  
bill of materials,  software bill of materials, and V INs allow organizations to quickly identify vehicles 
affected by validated threats. A best practice is for organizations to have a thorough  asset 
inventory list that can be used to speed up process es to  identify  the root cause of potential cyber 
events and contact  appropriate  supply chain partners as  necessary. Additionally, thorough  lists 
provide organization s confidence that the potential impacts of identified and validated threats are 
reasonably understood . 
In addition to development of a thorough  inventory list, maintaining the list  is also important . Over 
time, inventory lists often beco me fragmented when project managers leave companies, resulting 
in legacy hardware and software inventories existing only on isolated spreadsheets.  
Organization s that do not have a method ology to track this information  may leverage partnerships 
to obtain strategies that have worked well for other firms. 
2.6 BEST PRACTICES FOR INFORMATION ORGANIZATION , STORAGE , AND SHARING  
Much of the information generated as a byproduct of program requirements such as definition s, 
intelligence gather ing, threat monitoring, and threat analysis is valuable to the organization, as 
well as  its threat detection and response program s. Information can be organized, stored, and 
shared appropriately to inform future decisions in the threat detection and respon se program by 
using historical trends and results.  Types  of information to organize  and store  include:  
• Threat actors  
o Name  or identifier  
o Threat actor description  
o Source of primary threat actor intelligence ( i.e., point of contact  to he lp refresh data 
periodically)  
o Observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)  
o Associated internet protocol (IP) address es and assets  
o Threat events each actor is associated with  
• Threat events  
o Affected systems  
o Affected system suppliers and product owner s

o Threat event r isk assessments  
o Associated references to v ulnerability management systems  
• Threat intelligence requirements  
o Source of collection requirements  
o Reference to risk  or threat that each requirement is intended  to address  
• Threat monitoring  
o Data associated with m onitoring requirements  
o Data associated with monitoring performa nce ( false positives/negatives)  
o Data associated with performance  of threat intelligence sources  
• Any associated timestamps , coordinated in a way that events from disparate systems can 
be correlated to each other  (e.g. universal time code ) 
2.6.1 Key Considerations for Information Storage  and Organization  
When defining  steps to store threat detection a nd analysis information , organizations might want 
to consider several factors such as types of data, storage  methodology , and length of period for 
storage . 
The first decision organizations could  make is how to securely store and manage access control 
to threat detection and analysi s information. Steps  for securely storing sensitive data and 
managing access control include:  
• Develop ing a process for vetting and authorizing new access requests to the data  
• Periodically audit ing the authorized individuals to help ensure their access is s till required  
• Limit ing access to the data to only those individuals that are providing updated data or 
need to query the data  
• Limit ing data modification capabilities to only those that requ ire the need to modify the 
data 
• Maintaining logs of data queries an d modifications  
• Ensuring h igh availability and disaster recovery   
• Implementing e ncryption  protocols  
• Using an i nformation classification  system  
• Giving  more recent  events priority over ol der events prior to overwriting or rollover   
• Summarizing events ( e.g. counts) prior to overwriting  or rollover   
• Implementing  controls  (e.g. digital signatures ) to protect the integrity of event data 
while  stored  onboard and offboard  
• Using  a store -and-forward approach to cope with network availability issues  
• Defining retention and backup requirements   
Following storage, information  can be organized to allow organizations and teams to effective ly 
use it. A best practice for information  organ ization is to define key process indicators  using 
available  information, and then create  dashboards and reports to enable future analysis of stored 
information . Organizations may consider integrating this information into their vulnerability 
management and incident response processes. This will enable more rapid and accurate data 
access during an incident. It also makes the collating of information more efficient if all systems 
are using the same terminolog y and object models.

2.6.2 Approaches for Internal and External Sharing  
Threat detection and analys is information  may be shared and used across the organization t o 
help ensure thorough  analysis.  Intelligence adds value when shared to assist with operation al or 
strategic decisions.  Actionable intelligence is especially useful if a threat is active. (See the Auto-
ISAC’s  Risk Assessment and  Management Best Practice Guide  for more information) . Some 
considerations for organizations when defining how and what information to s hare are : 
• How to determine if i nformation can  or should be shared  
• Approval process (if applicable) to share informatio n internally and/or  externally  that could 
include : legal, safety, communications, and in-vehicle Subject Matter Experts (SME)  
• Audiences for the typ e of information to be shared  
• Mechanisms for distribution of informati on to approved parties  
• Negotiating a  common format for sharing information in advance of sharing (e.g. tagging 
or prioritization) ( See Section 2.3.3)  
Possible  mechanisms  for internal and external sharing of information include:  
• Newsletter summari es with appropriate  email distribution published daily  or weekly  with 
special alerts as needed  
• Reoccurring staff meetings for cybersecurity stakeholders  or cross  functional staff to 
update  and exchange information  
• Dedicated  internal website or portal   
• Auto-ISAC portal   
• Chat room alerts  
• Providing  feedback to intelligence source s related to quality of intelligence received  
• Utilizing  existing corporate/organizationa l communication platforms for sharing updates  
• Incorporat ing information into training and awareness materials  
• Send ing information out to appropriate organization members on a regular cadence ( e.g. 
monthly, q uarterly) providing awareness information, indu stry updates around threats, 
information location, and communication contact points.  
Some internal stakeholders that may find intelligence valuable when shared include:  
• Customer care and aftermarket teams : Data may allow analysis of  user behavior , 
consistent with privacy policies, to prevent fraud , abuse , or exploit . 
• Joint ventures and subsidiaries : May benefit from  appropriate collection requirements and 
compartmentalization in each environment or region.  
• Legal and public relations: May benefit from compliance requirements in each 
environment or region.  
• Other internal teams:  Share awareness and knowledge (e.g. threats, suspicious chatter, 
inquiries from researchers, reverse engineering that might result  
In addition to  defin ing how an organization is going to share information, they may define how to 
properly handle such information . An organization may define  the specific data handling 
procedures that accompany certain types of data labels. Distributors of the sensitive info rmation 
should take steps to help  ensure  that those receiving any information are aware of their duty to 
protect the sensitive information.
