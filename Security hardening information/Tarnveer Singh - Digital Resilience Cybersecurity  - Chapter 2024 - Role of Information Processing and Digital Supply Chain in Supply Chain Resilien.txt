Cyber Resilience and Improving Cybersecurity in the Supply Chain
DOI: 10.4324/9781003604969-5


Cyber Resilience
Van’t Schip (2024) argues that in the ever-evolving landscape of global commerce, the intricate web of supply chains has become the backbone of modern businesses. These intricate networks facilitate the seamless flow of goods, services, and information across borders, enabling companies to operate efficiently and meet the demands of their customers. For all these reasons, supply chain cybersecurity is increasingly in the cross-hairs of regulators.1
Salvi et al. (2022) insist cyber resilience is the most important contributor to digital resilience in the digital age.2 As supply chains grow more complex and interconnected, the potential for cyber threats and vulnerabilities escalates, underscoring the critical importance of cyber resilience and having in place robust cybersecurity measures.
Aldasoro et al. (2022) argue that technology is a major threat to supply chains yet regularly misunderstood. Advances in IT drive efficiencies and respond to fast-changing markets, while also enabling massive data collection across supply chain processes. The shift towards digitalisation, automation, and technological integration is complex and not always smooth.3
There is a need for a strategic approach to leveraging technology for modern supply chains. Research indicates that supply chains are in the early stages of a digital transformation, likely the biggest change in supply chain management in years. Although the future is unclear, supply chain leaders must adapt to this new paradigm or risk being left behind.
Boh et al. (2023) contend cyber resilience is crucial in developing the foundation of security on which to build towards digital resilience but also caution against thinking of technology as a panacea to develop resilience.4
We live in an era where cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread, posing significant risks to the integrity and resilience of supply chains. Cybercriminals exploit weaknesses in digital systems, compromising sensitive data, disrupting operations, and causing financial losses that can ripple through entire industries. Consequently, organisations must prioritise cybersecurity as a strategic imperative, ensuring the protection of their supply chains from malicious actors and safeguarding their competitive advantage.
Garcia-Perez et al. (2023) assert that cyber resilience is crucial, especially at times of digital transformation, and that developing cyber resilience is sorely needed in the healthcare sector. This would have avoided many of the recent cyber breaches that impacted the NHS in the UK and health insurance companies in the USA.5
We must better understand the realm of supply chain cybersecurity, its significance, common threats, and the strategies employed to mitigate risks. We aim to empower businesses with the knowledge and tools necessary to fortify their supply chains against cyber attacks, fostering a secure and resilient environment for global trade.
Al-Hawamleh (2024) argues cyber resilience is vital to help fortify organisational defences against the evolving landscape of cyber threats while enhancing business continuity. The aim is to provide businesses with a robust and adaptive strategy that extends beyond traditional cybersecurity paradigms. By integrating governance and leadership principles, collaboration with external stakeholders, and continuous monitoring, this can foster a holistic approach to cyber resilience. Leveraging a behavioural perspective, we can consider human factors, user awareness, and decision-making processes, recognising the critical role of organisational culture in fostering a cybersecurity-aware ethos.6
Adenekan et al. (2024) insist the importance of cybersecurity in supply chain management cannot be overstated. Supply chains are intricate ecosystems that involve numerous stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and retailers. Each of these entities relies on interconnected digital systems and data exchange, creating potential entry points for cyber threats.7
Supply Chain Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity breaches within the supply chain can have far-reaching consequences. Data breaches can be hugely damaging. Sensitive information, such as intellectual property, trade secrets, and customer data, can be compromised, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities. Operational disruptions can grind businesses to a halt. Cyber attacks can disrupt critical systems, causing delays, production stoppages, and logistical bottlenecks, ultimately impacting the entire supply chain. Financial losses can be severe. The direct and indirect costs associated with cyber incidents, including remediation efforts, legal fees, and lost revenue, can be substantial and potentially catastrophic for businesses. Failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures may result in non-compliance with industry regulations and standards, leading to penalties and legal consequences. High-profile cyber attacks can erode consumer trust and confidence, potentially causing long-term harm to a company’s brand, reputation, and market position.
By prioritising cybersecurity within the supply chain, organisations can mitigate these risks, protect their assets, and maintain the integrity of their operations. Robust cybersecurity measures not only safeguard against financial and operational losses but also foster trust and confidence among stakeholders, enabling businesses to thrive in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.
Supply chains are vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats, each with the potential to disrupt operations and compromise sensitive data. Understanding these threats is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.
Phishing attacks can cause significant damage beyond the initial compromise. Malicious actors employ social engineering techniques, such as fraudulent emails or websites, to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or granting unauthorised access to systems. Malware and ransomware can cause long-lasting impact. Malicious software can infiltrate supply chain systems, causing data breaches, system failures, and even holding critical information or operations hostage for ransom payments. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks cause temporary but deeply impactful damage. Cyber attackers overwhelm networks and systems with excessive traffic, rendering them unavailable or disrupting operations.
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are very difficult to protect any organisation against. Sophisticated and targeted attacks, often sponsored by nation-states or organised cybercriminal groups, aim to gain long-term access to systems for data exfiltration or disruption. Internet of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities are so pervasive that they are difficult to identify and protect. The proliferation of connected devices in supply chain operations, such as sensors and tracking systems, introduces new entry points for cyber threats if not properly secured.
Third-party risks are hard to control. Supply chains involve multiple stakeholders, and a breach or vulnerability in one partner’s systems can potentially compromise the entire network. Insider threats are difficult to identify. Disgruntled or negligent employees, contractors, or business partners with access to sensitive information or systems can intentionally or unintentionally cause data breaches or operational disruptions.
To effectively combat these threats, organisations must adopt a comprehensive approach to cyber resilience including a cybersecurity strategy that encompasses people, processes, and technology. Regular risk assessments, employee training, robust access controls, and continuous monitoring are essential components of a strong cybersecurity posture within the supply chain.
Crosignani, et al. (2023) argue the consequences of supply chain cybersecurity breaches can be far-reaching and devastating for organisations. Beyond the immediate financial losses and operational disruptions, these incidents can have long-lasting impacts on a company’s reputation, customer trust, and overall business performance.
One of the most significant impacts of a supply chain breach is the potential for data loss or theft. Sensitive information, such as intellectual property, trade secrets, and customer data, can fall into the wrong hands, leading to competitive disadvantages, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Additionally, the loss of critical operational data can immobilise supply chain processes, causing delays, production stoppages, and logistical challenges.
Supply chain breaches can also result in substantial financial losses. Direct costs may include remediation efforts, legal fees, regulatory fines, and the implementation of enhanced security measures. Indirect costs, such as lost revenue due to operational disruptions, customer attrition, and reputational damage, can be even more significant and long-lasting.
Furthermore, supply chain breaches can erode consumer trust and confidence in a company’s ability to protect sensitive information and maintain secure operations. In today’s digital age, where customers prioritise data privacy and security, a high-profile cyber incident can severely tarnish a brand’s reputation, leading to a loss of market share and diminished customer loyalty.

Case Studies
The Target data breach (2013) was huge in scale. In one of the largest data breaches in retail history, hackers gained access to Target’s systems through a third-party vendor’s credentials. Plachkinova & Maurer (2018) argue this breach compromised the personal and financial information of over 70 million customers, resulting in significant financial losses, legal fees, and a tarnished reputation for the retail giant.8
The NotPetya cyber attack (2017) had huge financial implications. The NotPetya ransomware attack, initially targeting Ukrainian businesses, quickly spread through global supply chains, affecting major corporations like Maersk, Merck, and FedEx. The attack caused widespread operational disruptions, resulting in billions of dollars in losses and highlighting the vulnerability of interconnected supply chain systems.9
These case studies underscore the severe consequences of supply chain cybersecurity breaches and the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect against such incidents.

Risk Mitigation
Hoang (2023) argues clawback provisions in employment contracts are a simple way to ensure executives take cyber risk seriously. CISOs that aren’t getting the levels of investment in cybersecurity they need should consider their position. Raising security awareness amongst Executive Boards is an essential precursor to any cybersecurity strategy. Shareholders and Board must understand the importance of cybersecurity to their organisations and consider clawback and other mechanisms to prevent a situation where CEOs prioritise short-term gain at the expense of cybersecurity.10
Technology plays a pivotal role in securing the supply chain against cyber threats. By leveraging advanced solutions and innovative approaches, organisations can fortify their defences and enhance their ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents.
A comprehensive cybersecurity strategy should incorporate cybersecurity tools and solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), antivirus and anti-malware software, and data encryption technologies. These solutions help protect systems and data from unauthorised access, malware infections, and data breaches.
Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies offer enhanced transparency, traceability, and immutability within supply chains. By creating a tamper-proof record of transactions and data, these technologies can help mitigate risks associated with data manipulation, counterfeiting, and fraud.
Leveraging cloud computing and virtualisation technologies can enhance supply chain security by centralising data storage and management, enabling real-time monitoring, and facilitating rapid incident response and recovery efforts.
Internet of Things (IoT) security is essential. As the adoption of IoT devices in supply chain operations continues to grow, implementing robust security measures for these connected devices is crucial. This includes secure device configuration, regular software updates, and robust access controls.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are important emerging technologies. AI and ML algorithms can analyse vast amounts of data to identify potential threats, detect anomalies, and provide predictive insights, enabling proactive risk mitigation and enhanced situational awareness within supply chain operations.
Implementing robust identity and access management (IAM) solutions, such as multi-factor authentication, role-based access controls, and privileged access management, can help prevent unauthorised access to critical systems and data within the supply chain.
Deploying real-time monitoring and incident response capabilities is essential for rapidly detecting and responding to cyber threats, minimising the impact of potential breaches, and facilitating swift recovery efforts.
By embracing these technological solutions and integrating them into a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, organisations can significantly enhance the security and resilience of their supply chains, protecting against cyber threats and ensuring business continuity.
Effective supply chain cybersecurity requires collaboration and information sharing among stakeholders. Supply chains are interconnected ecosystems, and a breach or vulnerability in one entity can potentially impact the entire network. Consequently, fostering open communication, establishing trusted partnerships, and promoting industry-wide cooperation are crucial for mitigating cyber risks.
Public–private partnerships can resolve deep-rooted problems. Collaboration between government agencies, law enforcement, and private sector organisations can facilitate the exchange of threat intelligence, best practices, and incident response strategies, enhancing overall supply chain security.
Industry associations and information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) enable collaboration. Participating in industry-specific associations and ISACs enables organisations to share threat information, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies, promoting a collective defence against cyber threats.
Implementing robust supply chain risk management (SCRM) programmes that assess and manage risks across the entire supply chain, including third-party vendors and partners, can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
Promoting cybersecurity awareness and providing comprehensive training to employees, suppliers, and partners can enhance overall security posture and reduce the risk of human error or insider threats within the supply chain.
Developing and regularly testing incident response plans and exercises in collaboration with supply chain partners can improve coordination, communication, and overall preparedness in the event of a cyber incident.
By fostering collaboration and information sharing, organisations can leverage collective knowledge, resources, and expertise to stay ahead of emerging cyber threats and enhance the overall resilience of their supply chains.
To safeguard your supply chain from cyber threats and ensure business continuity, it is crucial to prioritise cybersecurity as a strategic imperative. The importance of cybersecurity in supply chain management cannot be overstated. As supply chains become increasingly interconnected and digitised, the potential for cyber threats escalates, posing significant risks to operational continuity, data integrity, and financial performance. By understanding common cyber threats, implementing robust security measures, leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and fostering collaboration and information sharing, organisations can fortify their defences and maintain a secure and resilient supply chain ecosystem. Embracing a proactive and comprehensive approach to supply chain cybersecurity is no longer an option but a necessity for businesses seeking to thrive in the digital age.
Dependence on digital technologies, while beneficial, exposes supply chains to cyber risks affecting operations, brand perception, and consumer trust. Notably, these risks can stem from partner organisations’ security weaknesses. For instance, in 2018, Marriott Hotels revealed that cyber attackers had stolen data from 500 million customers through a breach at Starwood Hotels, acquired by Marriott in
