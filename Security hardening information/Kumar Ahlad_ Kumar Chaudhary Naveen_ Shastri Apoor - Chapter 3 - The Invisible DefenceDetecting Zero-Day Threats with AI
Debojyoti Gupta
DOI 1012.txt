3.1 Introduction
The fight against cyber threats is relentless and increasingly complex, driven by the rapid evolution of technology. Among the most formidable adversaries in this domain are zero-day vulnerabilities, which remain unknown to both defenders and vendors, presenting a substantial risk that demands a sophisticated and proactive defence strategy.
This chapter introduces the concept of the “Invisible Defence,” an approach that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to detect zero-day threats. The “Invisible Defence” represents an undetectable and seamless protective barrier, safeguarding digital environments from emerging threats before they become apparent. This innovative defence strategy symbolizes the fusion of advanced AI algorithms with cybersecurity, aiming to create a resilient and imperceptible shield against the hidden dangers lurking in the digital landscape.
As we move into the complexity of AI-powered detection of zero-day threats, we will explore practical examples, demonstrating how AI can analyze behavior patterns and make predictive assessments to thwart potential exploits. We will also examine the challenges faced in implementing AI-driven solutions and the future advancements that are shaping the field of cybersecurity. In the “Invisible Defence,” the integration of AI and cybersecurity acts as a sentinel against the threat landscape. By understanding and harnessing the capabilities of AI, we can build more robust defences that not only respond to threats but also anticipate and neutralize them before they escalate into critical issues.


3.2 Literature Review
The domain of zero-day threat detection is a critical aspect of cybersecurity that has garnered significant attention in recent years. With the advent of sophisticated cyberattacks, traditional security measures have often proven inadequate, necessitating the development of advanced technologies like AI. This literature review examines existing research on AI-powered zero-day threat detection, identifying the strengths and gaps within the current body of knowledge.



Long Description for Figure 3.1
Malware Detection includes subcategories for PC malware and Android malware. Network Intrusion covers intrusion detection and anomaly detection. Phishing/Spam Detection consists of web phishing detection, mail phishing detection, spam on social networks, and spam mail. Other Applications involve countering advanced persistent threats (APTs) and identifying domain names generated by domain generation algorithms (DGAs). The structure presents a hierarchical organization, outlining how AI is applied across various cybersecurity domains. Each category and subcategory represents a specific area where AI enhances threat detection and defense mechanisms.

FIGURE 3.1 Main branches of cybersecurity applications adopting AI techniques (Truong et al., 2020).


3.2.1 AI in Cybersecurity
AI has emerged as a transformative force in cybersecurity, offering capabilities that extend beyond traditional defence mechanisms. AI technologies, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have been employed to detect anomalies, predict potential threats, and respond to security breaches in real time. For instance, Talukder et al. (2024) demonstrated the efficacy of ML algorithms in identifying network intrusions by analyzing traffic patterns. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2022) highlighted the potential of DL in recognizing complex attack vectors that evade conventional detection systems.


3.2.2 Zero-Day Threats
Zero-day threats are particularly challenging because they exploit vulnerabilities unknown to security experts and software vendors. Traditional security solutions, such as signature-based detection, are ineffective against these threats as they rely on pre-existing knowledge of attack patterns. AI, with its ability to learn and adapt, presents a promising solution to this problem. Yang Guo (2022) emphasized the role of reinforcement learning in developing adaptive defence mechanisms that can respond to previously unseen threats. Meanwhile, Tasneem et al. (2022) discussed the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to simulate potential attacks and train AI models to recognize and mitigate them.


3.2.3 Explainable AI
One significant advancement in AI-driven cybersecurity is Explainable AI (XAI), which seeks to make AI decision-making processes transparent. XAI addresses the “black box” problem inherent in many AI systems, thereby increasing trust and enabling better collaboration between human experts and AI. Capuano et al. (2022) explored the applications of XAI in cybersecurity, demonstrating how it enhances the interpretability of threat detection models and facilitates more informed decision-making.


3.2.4 Emerging Paradigms
Recent studies have introduced several innovative paradigms aimed at improving zero-day threat detection. Federated learning, for example, allows AI models to be trained on decentralized data sources without compromising privacy, thereby broadening the scope of threat intelligence. Alazab et al. (2022) explored the potential of federated learning in enhancing collaborative defence strategies across different organizations.


3.2.5 Existing Gaps
Despite the promising advancements, several gaps remain in the literature on AI-powered zero-day threat detection.

Scalability and Efficiency: While many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AI models in controlled environments, there is a lack of research on their scalability and efficiency in real-world, large-scale networks. Future research should focus on optimizing AI algorithms to handle vast amounts of data without compromising performance.
Integration with Existing Systems: There is limited exploration of how AI-driven solutions can be seamlessly integrated with existing cybersecurity infrastructures. Research is needed to develop frameworks that facilitate the adoption of AI technologies without disrupting current operations.
Adversarial Attacks: Although AI can enhance cybersecurity, it is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious actors manipulate input data to deceive AI models. Further studies are required to develop robust defence mechanisms against such attacks to ensure the reliability of AI systems in cybersecurity.
Human-AI Collaboration: While XAI aims to bridge the gap between AI and human experts, there is insufficient research on practical methodologies for effective collaboration. Future research should explore user-friendly interfaces and training programs that enable security professionals to work efficiently alongside AI systems.
Ethical Considerations: The deployment of AI in cybersecurity raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy and bias. There is a need for comprehensive studies that address these ethical issues and propose guidelines for the responsible use of AI in threat detection.




3.3 Understanding Zero-Day Threats

3.3.1 Unveiling Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
In the complex battle between cybersecurity defenders and malicious actors, zero-day vulnerabilities emerge as formidable opponents. These vulnerabilities represent undiscovered weaknesses in software or systems that cyberattackers exploit before developers can release a patch. The term “zero-day” signifies the critical timeframe during which organizations have no time for preparation or defence. It encompasses the urgency and unpredictability of these unseen threats, adding complexity to the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
These vulnerabilities can exist in operating systems, applications, or even firmware, providing a gateway for cybercriminals to carry out their attacks. What distinguishes zero-day vulnerabilities is their covert nature; they remain undisclosed to the public and defenders until exploited, making them powerful weapons in the hands of adversaries.


3.3.2 The Potential Impact
The potential consequences of a successful zero-day attack are significant. Given that there is no known solution or update available at the time of the attack, malicious actors can infiltrate systems, extract sensitive data, implant malware, or even compromise entire networks. The element of surprise and the absence of immediate countermeasures intensify the seriousness of the danger, making zero-day vulnerabilities a central concern for cybersecurity experts.



Long Description for Figure 3.2
The process starts with a developer uploading software to a server, making it publicly accessible. An attacker then probes the software for vulnerabilities and exploits them, targeting devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Once the vulnerability is discovered, it is disclosed, prompting the developer to create and upload a patch. The flowchart shows the sequence of events with arrows connecting each step, illustrating the progression from development to patching, following the discovery and exploitation of the vulnerability. The attacker and developer are depicted in distinct work environments, emphasizing their roles in the cycle.

FIGURE 3.2 Zero-day real-life scenario (Ali et al., 2022).

In essence, comprehending zero-day threats necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities themselves and the potential chaos they can cause in digital ecosystems. The pursuit of effective defence against such threats compels us to critically assess traditional security approaches and explore innovative strategies that surpass the conventional reactive measures.


3.3.3 Challenges in Conventional Security Approaches
Traditional security approaches, although valuable, frequently encounter inherent obstacles when confronted with zero-day threats. These obstacles encompass:

Lack of Prior Knowledge: Traditional security measures rely on known signatures and patterns. However, since zero-day vulnerabilities are inherently unknown, these approaches struggle to identify and prevent attacks that exploit such vulnerabilities.
Dependency on Patching: Conventional defence mechanisms heavily depend on timely patches provided by software vendors. In the case of zero-day vulnerabilities, the absence of a patch leaves systems exposed and susceptible to exploitation.
Limitations of Signature-Based Detection: Detection systems based on signatures may fail to recognize new and unseen attack patterns associated with zero-day threats. Consequently, organizations remain vulnerable to novel attack techniques.
Inadequate Response Time: The rapid exploitation timeline of zero-day vulnerabilities often surpasses the capability of traditional security measures to respond effectively. This time gap creates an opportunity window for attackers.




3.4 The Invisible Defence—AI in Zero-Day Threat Detection

3.4.1 AI as the Unseen Guardian
AI, when combined with cybersecurity, brings about a significant change in the ongoing battle against cyber threats. This change involves a shift from reactive defence to proactive and anticipatory protection. This transformation is represented by the concept of the “Unseen Protector,” where AI takes on the role of a hidden guardian. Its constant vigilance involves monitoring, analyzing, and neutralizing potential zero-day threats before they can manifest.
The metaphor of the “Invisible Defence” perfectly captures how AI-driven systems operate seamlessly in the background. These systems adapt to the ever-changing threat landscape without disrupting regular operations. Like an invisible sentry, AI utilizes advanced algorithms, ML, and behavioral analysis to fortify digital environments against the concealed dangers of zero-day vulnerabilities.


3.4.2 Real-World Vigilance—Examples of AI in Action
To grasp the tangible impact of the “Invisible Defence,” let’s illuminate real-world scenarios where AI has emerged as a sentinel against zero-day threats:



Long Description for Figure 3.3
At the top level, the title "Zero-day Attacks Detection" is displayed. Below it, three main categories are listed: "Anomaly Based," "Graph Based," and "AI Based." These categories represent different approaches to detecting zero-day attacks. Further below, four subcategories are shown: "Detection Models," "Datasets," "Evaluation Metrics," and "Main Approaches." These subcategories are connected to the main categories, indicating that they are relevant to all three detection approaches. The diagram uses rectangular boxes with a layered design to represent each category and subcategory, visually organizing the information in a clear and structured manner.

FIGURE 3.3 Zero-day attack detecting approach and how AI can be used (Ali et al., 2022).

Action: By analyzing user behavior and system interactions, AI identifies deviations from normal patterns. In the event of a zero-day attack, where traditional signatures are absent, AI raises flags and mitigates the threat based on anomalous behavior.
Predictive Modeling for Threat Anticipation
Situation: A security solution driven by AI employs predictive modeling.
Action: By utilizing historical data and continuously learning from emerging threats, the AI system predicts potential zero-day vulnerabilities and proactively strengthens defences.
Automated Response to Novel Threats

3.5.1.1.1 Illustration
Envision an AI-enabled security system seamlessly integrated into a network infrastructure. This system functions tirelessly, examining data streams in real time, scrutinizing network traffic, user interactions, and system activities. By utilizing the capabilities of ML algorithms, the AI identifies normal behavior patterns within milliseconds, enabling it to promptly detect any deviations that may indicate a potential zero-day threat.
Model Can be Used: Anomaly Detection with Unsupervised Learning
The cornerstone of this AI-enabled security system’s capability is an anomaly detection model built on unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning allows the AI to learn from the inherent structure of the data without explicit labels, making it adept at discerning patterns that deviate from the norm. The model continuously refines its understanding of what constitutes “normal” behavior, adapting to the evolving dynamics of the network environment.
Anomaly Score=|xi−μ|σ
Where xi is the current data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation of the historical data.



3.5.1.2 Workflow of the AI-Enabled Security System

Real-Time Data Ingestion
The AI-enabled security system consistently acquires data from various sources such as network logs, user activities, and system events.
Feature Extraction
To distill pertinent information from the incoming data streams, advanced feature extraction techniques are utilized. This involves extracting key characteristics and attributes that define the behavior of the network and its components.
Training Phase
During the initial training phase, the AI model learns the baseline patterns of normal behavior by analyzing historical data. This phase enables the system to comprehend the regular activities and communication patterns within the network.
Real-Time Monitoring
Once trained, the AI-enabled security system transitions into real-time monitoring mode. It continuously analyzes incoming data streams, applying the learned patterns to identify expected behaviors.



Long Description for Figure 3.4
The flowchart begins with "Data Ingestion," which leads to "Feature Extraction." From there, the process splits into two paths. The first path proceeds to the "Training Phase," which is used to build the detection model. The second path starts with "Real-Time Monitoring," which feeds into "Anomaly Detection." If an anomaly is detected, the process moves to "Alert Generation," completing the flow.

FIGURE 3.4 Workflow of Anomaly Detection.

Anomaly Detection
The system’s ML algorithms compare real-time observations with the established baseline. Any deviation, anomaly, or unusual pattern triggers an alert, indicating a potential zero-day threat.
Alert Generation
Upon detecting an anomaly, the system generates an alert that provides comprehensive insights into the observed deviation. This includes information on the type of anomaly, affected components, and potential risks associated with the deviation.



3.5.1.3 The Vital Role of Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection emerges as a crucial player in the story of zero-day threat mitigation. In the absence of predefined signatures for zero-day exploits, AI relies on anomaly detection to identify irregularities and deviations from established baselines. This proactive approach empowers AI to identify potential threats that defy traditional security measures.
Real-World Examples:

Network Anomalies
Scenario: An AI-driven intrusion detection system monitors network traffic.
Action: In real time, the AI identifies an unusual surge in data transfer patterns that do not align with normal usage. This triggers an immediate investigation and response, preventing a potential zero-day exploit from infiltrating the network.
User Behavior Anomalies
Scenario: AI is integrated into endpoint protection solutions.
Action: A user, typically engaged in routine activities, suddenly displays abnormal behavior by accessing sensitive files at irregular hours. The AI flags this deviation, recognizing it as a potential insider threat or a zero-day exploit attempting unauthorized access.
System Process Anomalies
Scenario: An AI-powered security system monitors system processes.
Action: Upon detecting an unexpected deviation in the behavior of a critical system process, the AI triggers an alert, initiating an immediate response to investigate and neutralize a potential zero-day attack attempting to manipulate system functions.
Application Behavior Anomalies
Scenario: AI is integrated into application security frameworks.
Action: When an application unexpectedly exhibits behavior inconsistent with its normal operations, the AI identifies this anomaly, raising an alarm and preventing the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability within the application.





3.6 Behavioral Analysis and Predictive Modeling
The Patterns of Behavioral Analysis in Zero-Day Threat Identification:
Behavioral analysis emerges as a beacon of insight, allowing it to decipher the nuanced patterns of digital behaviors. At the heart of this strategy is the marriage between AI and the ability to scrutinize, understand, and respond to the behaviors that unfold within the digital ecosystem.

3.6.1 AI’s Models and Examples for Behavioral Analysis

User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
AI Model: ML Algorithms (e.g., Clustering, Decision Trees).
Example: UBA analyzes user activities such as login patterns, data access, and resource usage. Anomalies, like unusual login times or access to sensitive data, trigger alerts for potential zero-day threats.

Clustering: Functionality: Clustering algorithms group users together based on similarities in their behavior.
Example: Let’s consider an organization that utilizes clustering to identify groups of users who exhibit similar access patterns. If a cluster displays unexpected behavior, such as accessing files outside their usual scope, it could indicate a potential zero-day threat.
K−Means Objective Function=∑i=1k∑x∈ Ci‖x−μi‖2
where Ci is the cluster, x are the data points, and μi is the centroid of the cluster.
Decision Trees: Functionality: Decision trees create a series of decisions based on user actions, aiding in the identification of specific patterns that lead to anomalies.
Example: Within the realm of UBA, decision trees can analyze login patterns. For instance, if a user who historically logs in from a specific geographical location suddenly attempts access from a different region, the decision tree can detect this anomaly and trigger an alert.
P(y|X)=1N∑i=1NI(yi=y)⋅P(Xi|yi)
where P(y∣X) is the probability of outcome y, given feature set X, and I is the indicator function.


UBA Workflow:

Data Collection
UBA gathers data on user activities, including login times, data access, and resource usage.
Feature Extraction
Relevant features are extracted, such as login frequency, access times, and the sensitivity of the accessed data.
Clustering Analysis
Clustering algorithms group users based on similar behavior patterns, helping to identify outliers and anomalies.
Decision Tree Analysis:
Decision trees analyze specific user actions, pinpointing deviations from established patterns.
Anomaly Detection
Alerts are triggered when users exhibit behavior that falls outside the norm, indicating potential zero-day threats.
Real-World Scenario: UBA Detecting Anomalous Data Access
Let’s consider an employee who typically accesses a specific set of files during working hours. By utilizing clustering and decision trees, UBA observes that this user, on a weekend and outside of typical hours, attempts to access highly sensitive files that they have never accessed before. This triggers an alert as it significantly deviates from the user’s historical behavior, raising suspicion of a potential zero-day threat.



3.6.2 Predictive Modeling: Real-World Applications and AI Models

Threat Intelligence Platforms
AI Model: ML Algorithms (e.g., Random Forests).
Example: Predictive models in threat intelligence platforms analyze historical threat data, helping organizations anticipate potential zero-day threats based on evolving attack trends.
ML Algorithms (Random Forests)
Random Forests are a type of ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.
y^=1T∑i=1Ty^i
where:
y^ is the final prediction.
T is the total number of trees in the forest.
y^i is the prediction of the i-th tree.
For instance, in Threat Intelligence Platforms, Random Forests play a crucial role in analyzing historical threat data. They take into account various factors such as attack vectors, malware signatures, and tactics used by threat actors. By conducting this analysis, Random Forests help in building predictive models that can anticipate potential zero-day threats.
Workflow of a Threat Intelligence Platform:

Data Collection
Threat Intelligence Platforms gather a vast amount of data, including historical threat data, indicators of compromise (IoCs), and information about known attack patterns.
Feature Extraction
From the collected data, relevant features are extracted. These features may include attack vectors, malware characteristics, and patterns of past incidents.
ML Model Training
ML algorithms, particularly Random Forests, are trained using the historical data to identify patterns associated with known threats. As a result, the model becomes proficient in recognizing relationships between different features.
Predictive Modeling
Once the model is trained, it applies the learned patterns to new incoming data. By identifying anomalies or patterns that deviate from historical trends, the model can predict potential zero-day threats.
Real-Time Threat Analysis
Threat Intelligence Platforms continuously analyze real-time data by applying the predictive model. This helps in identifying emerging threats. Any deviation from the expected patterns triggers alerts.
Alert Generation and Mitigation
When threats are detected, detailed alerts are generated. These alerts provide valuable insights into potential zero-day threats. Security teams can then take proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance the overall security posture.
Real-Life Situation: Predicting Changing Attack Patterns
Imagine a Threat Intelligence Platform that examines past information about phishing attacks. By understanding the traits of known phishing attempts, the Random Forests model can anticipate potential zero-day threats by detecting fresh patterns or strategies used by threat actors. If a phishing campaign emerges with distinct features that have never been encountered before, the model triggers an alert, empowering organizations to prepare for and protect against the evolving threat.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
AI Model: Reinforcement Learning Models.
Example: SIEM systems use reinforcement learning to adaptively respond to evolving threats. Predictive modeling helps forecast potential security incidents based on historical data.
Reinforcement Learning Models
Functionality: Reinforcement learning involves training models to make sequences of decisions by learning from rewards or penalties.
Example: In the context of SIEM, reinforcement learning models dynamically respond to security events by acquiring knowledge from historical data. These models anticipate potential security incidents, aiding the system in proactively safeguarding against evolving threats.
Policy (π)
A policy map states actions. The goal is to find the optimal policy (π*).
π:S→A
where S is the set of states and A is the set of actions.
Value Function (V)
The value function V(s) represents the expected reward starting from state s and following policy π.
Vπ(s)=E[Rt|st=s|
where Rt is the cumulative reward from time step t.
Q-Value (Q)
The Q-value Q(s, a) represents the expected reward for taking action a in state s and then following policy π.
Qπ(s,a)=E[Rt|st=s,at=a]
Bellman Equation
The Bellman equation provides a recursive definition for the value function.
V(s)=maxa∑s'_(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s')+γV(s')]
where:
P(s′∣s, a) is the transition probability from state s to state s′ given action a.
R(s, a, s′) is the reward received after transitioning from s to s′ via action a.
γ is the discount factor (0 ≤ γ ≤ 1).
Q-Learning Update Rule
In Q-learning, the Q-values are updated using the following rule:
Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α[r+γ maxa' Q(s',a')−Q(s,a)]
where:
α is the learning rate.
r is the reward received after taking action a in state s.
s′ is the next state after taking action a.
SIEM Workflow:

Data Collection
SIEM systems gather and consolidate extensive amounts of security-related data, including logs, events, and incident reports.
Feature Extraction
Relevant attributes are extracted from the accumulated data, encompassing various aspects such as user behavior, network activities, and system events.
Reinforcement Learning Model Training
Reinforcement learning models are trained on historical data to discern patterns associated with normal and abnormal behavior. The model adjusts its decision-making process based on the feedback loop of rewards and penalties.
Predictive Modeling
The model applies its acquired patterns to new data, predicting potential security incidents by identifying anomalies or deviations from historical trends.
Real-Time Event Analysis
SIEM continuously analyzes real-time security events, employing the reinforcement learning model to dynamically respond to emerging threats. Predictions assist in prioritizing and addressing incidents.
Adaptive Response and Alert Generation
The system adaptively responds to security events based on the predictions made by the reinforcement learning model. Alerts are generated, providing insights into potential security incidents and recommended response actions.
Real-World Scenario: Dynamic Response to Emerging Threats
Imagine a SIEM system that diligently monitors network traffic. Through the use of reinforcement learning, this advanced model has been trained on historical data to accurately predict normal patterns of network behavior. However, in the event of a new and unfamiliar threat, like a previously unseen malware variant, the model swiftly identifies the anomaly and adjusts its response accordingly. As a result, the SIEM system promptly generates an alert, while the model continuously enhances its comprehension of the ever-changing threat landscape.

Next-Generation Firewalls
AI Model: Ensemble Models (combining various algorithms).
Example: Predictive modeling in Next-Generation Firewalls identifies patterns associated with known threats and predicts potential zero-day vulnerabilities by analyzing network traffic and application behavior.
Ensemble models are designed to enhance the overall predictive performance and robustness of ML algorithms by integrating multiple models. For instance, in the context of Next-Generation Firewalls, ensemble models are utilized to analyze network traffic and application behavior. By combining diverse algorithms, these models are able to predict potential threats, including zero-day vulnerabilities, based on learned patterns.
In a real-world scenario, ensemble models play a crucial role in identifying emerging threats. Let’s consider a Next-Generation Firewall that is constantly monitoring incoming network traffic. The ensemble model, which consists of various algorithms, has been trained to recognize normal patterns and known threat signatures. However, if a new type of attack, previously unseen, emerges with distinct characteristics, the ensemble model is able to detect this anomaly. As a result, the Firewall generates an alert, and the model adapts itself to incorporate the new threat information. This continuous adaptation enhances the model’s predictive capabilities, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the evolving threat landscape.
AI-Driven Threat Hunting Platforms
AI Model: GANs.
Example: GANs in Threat Hunting Platforms generate synthetic data to simulate potential zero-day scenarios. This aids in training models to recognize novel threat patterns.
GANs:
Functionality: GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, working adversarially to generate realistic synthetic data.
Example: In Threat Hunting Platforms, GANs generate synthetic data that simulates potential zero-day scenarios. The generated data aids in training models to recognize novel threat patterns and enhances the platform’s ability to proactively hunt for emerging threats.

Data Generation with GANs
Threat Hunting Platforms use GANs to generate synthetic data that simulates potential zero-day scenarios. This synthetic data represents various attack patterns, behaviors, and tactics.
Training Models with Synthetic Data
The generated synthetic data is used to train ML models, enabling them to recognize and understand novel threat patterns.
Threat Simulation
The trained models simulate potential zero-day scenarios using the knowledge gained from the synthetic data. This includes mimicking new attack vectors, evasion techniques, and emerging threat behaviors.
Real-Time Threat Analysis
Threat Hunting Platforms continuously analyze real-time data, incorporating the insights gained from the synthetic data and trained models. This allows the platform to detect anomalies that may signify emerging threats.
Alert Generation and Threat Hunting
Detected anomalies trigger alerts, prompting threat hunters to investigate potential zero-day threats. Threat hunting involves actively searching for and mitigating emerging threats based on the knowledge gained from synthetic data.
Real-World Scenario: Simulating Novel Threat Scenarios
Consider a Threat Hunting Platform that leverages GANs to generate synthetic data representing a new type of malware behavior. The generated data includes unique characteristics and evasion techniques. The platform uses this synthetic data to train models to recognize these novel threat patterns. When a similar pattern emerges in real-time data, the platform detects the anomaly, generating an alert for further investigation (Huang et al., 2017).





3.7 Challenges and Limitations in Zero-Day Threat Detection

3.7.1 Relying Solely on AI: A Pragmatic Assessment

Adversarial Sophistication
Challenge: Adversaries are becoming increasingly adept at creating attacks specifically designed to evade AI detection. This poses a significant challenge to the reliability of AI as the primary defence against rapidly evolving zero-day threats.
Mitigation: To address this challenge, it is crucial to continuously improve AI models through robust adversarial training and the integration of diverse detection mechanisms.
False Positives and Negatives
Challenge: AI models can generate false positives, mistakenly identifying normal activities as threats, or false negatives, overlooking actual zero-day threats. Striking the right balance between precision and recall remains an ongoing challenge.
Mitigation: To mitigate this issue, algorithms need to be fine-tuned, human validation should be incorporated, and ensemble models can be leveraged to minimize false outcomes.
