Chapter: 1947 - Among its standards is the OSI model, introduced in the late 1970s, which comprehensively addresses network communications. An open system, as defined by the OSI model, encompasses protocols enabling communication between diverse systems, regardless of their underlying structures. The OSI model serves as a framework for comprehending and developing network architectures that are adaptable, resilient, and compatible.
Open Systems Interconnection model
The OSI model is a structured framework designed for building network systems, and facilitates communication across diverse computer systems. It breaks down network communication into seven interlinked layers. Each layer performs a specific task involved in moving data between different computer systems, regardless of their underlying technology. This layered approach ensures smooth communication even between very different devices.
The OSI model is structured with seven abstraction layers organized in a sequential manner, refer to Figure 1.1.
Physical layer
The physical layer occupies the lowest position. Its primary function involves establishing the physical connection between devices. Within this layer, data is represented in the form of bits, and it is responsible for the transmission of individual bits between nodes. This layer (layer 1) encompasses the hardware involved in data transfer, such as cables and switches. It is responsible for converting data into a bitstream, a sequence of 1s and 0s, which is then transmitted through the physical medium. Both devices must agree on a signal convention to ensure that the 1s and 0s are correctly interpreted on both ends.
Data link layer
Data link layer is responsible for facilitating the delivery of messages between nodes. Its primary role involves ensuring error-free data transfer between nodes, operating atop the physical layer. Upon the arrival of a packet within a network, the data link layer is responsible for forwarding it to the appropriate host using its Media Access Control (MAC) address. This layer (layer 2) is similar to the network layer, manages data transfer, but it operates between two devices on the same network. It takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames, which are then sent across the network. The data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control within the same network, whereas the transport layer handles these functions for communication between different networks.
Network layer
The network layer is also termed as traffic director of the OSI model, it ensures data packets reach their destination across vast networks by determining the best routes. It is the bridge between logical addressing and the physical path data takes. This layer (layer 3) enables data transfer between different networks by breaking down segments from the transport layer into smaller units called packets on the sender's device and reassembling them on the receiving device. It also determines the optimal physical path for the data to reach its destination, a process known as routing. This layer is essential when communication occurs between devices on different networks. Key protocols within the network layer include IP, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Internet Group Management Protocol. (IGMP), and the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) suite.
Transport layer
The transport layer ensures reliable and efficient data delivery between hosts, managing issues such as packet sequencing, error correction, and flow control. It accomplishes this by establishing end-to-end connections, segmenting data into manageable units, and providing mechanisms for error detection and recovery. The transport layer (layer 4) ensures end-to-end communication between devices by managing data from the session layer. It breaks the data into smaller units called segments for transmission to Layer 3, and on the receiving side, it reassembles these segments into a format the session layer can use. Additionally, the transport layer handles flow control, regulating transmission speed to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slower receiver, and error control, which checks for complete data reception and requests retransmission if needed. Key protocols at this layer include TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
Session layer
The session layer manages and establishes sessions between applications, ensuring orderly communication. It facilitates dialogue coordination, synchronization, and termination between devices. This layer (layer 5) manages the opening and closing of communication between two devices, with the period during which communication remains active being termed the session. It ensures that the session remains open just long enough to transfer all the necessary data and then promptly closes it to conserve resources. Additionally, the session layer synchronizes data transfer using checkpoints, which allows resumption from the last checkpoint in case of a disconnect or crash. For instance, during a 100-megabyte file transfer, checkpoints every 5 megabytes would mean that if 52 megabytes are transferred before an interruption, the transfer can resume from the last checkpoint, needing to send only the remaining 50 megabytes rather than starting over.
Presentation layer
The presentation layer is responsible for ensuring that data exchanged between applications is in a format that can be understood by both parties. It handles tasks such as data encryption, compression, and data conversion to ensure seamless communication between different systems. The presentation layer (layer 6) is crucial for preparing data for use by the application layer, ensuring it is in a format that applications can understand. This layer handles the translation of data between different encoding methods used by communicating devices, ensuring that the incoming data is converted into a syntax that the receiving device’s application layer can process.
Additionally, the presentation layer manages encryption and compression. For encrypted connections, it applies encryption on the sender’s side and decrypts the data on the receiver’s side, delivering readable data to the application layer. It also compresses data from the application layer before passing it to the session layer, enhancing communication speed and efficiency by reducing the amount of data to be transferred.
Application layer
The application layer serves as the interface between the user's applications and the underlying network. It enables communication services and network-aware applications to interact with the network protocols. The application layer (layer 7) is the topmost layer that directly interacts with the user’s data. Software applications such as web browsers and email clients use the application layer to initiate communications. However, it's important to note that these client applications themselves are not part of the application layer. Instead, the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that allow the software to present meaningful information to the user.
Key protocols within the application layer include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which facilitates web communication, and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is crucial for email communications. These protocols ensure that data requested by the user is returned in the required format, enabling seamless interaction with various online services.

The OSI model offers several key advantages:

Enhancing users comprehension of networking on a broader scale.
Assisting users in comprehending the collaborative functioning of hardware and software elements.
Simplifying troubleshooting by dividing networks into manageable segments.
Establishing standardized terminology for networking professionals to compare fundamental functional relationships across diverse networks.
Supporting users in grasping emerging technologies as they evolve.
Assisting in interpreting vendors’ descriptions of product functionalities.

The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet protocol suite, is a conceptual framework for the standards and protocols used for communication over the Internet. The TCP/IP model, unlike the OSI model, uses a simpler four-layer approach, as shown in Figure 1.
