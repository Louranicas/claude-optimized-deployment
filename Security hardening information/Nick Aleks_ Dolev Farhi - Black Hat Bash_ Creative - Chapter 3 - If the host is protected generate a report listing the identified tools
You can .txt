# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Nick Aleks_ Dolev Farhi - Black Hat Bash_ Creative Scripting for Hackers and Pentesters (2024, NO STARCH PRESS, INC) - libgen.li (1)
Chapter: 3 - If the host is protected, generate a report listing the identified tools.
You can find an example solution, exercise_solution.sh, in the book’s GitHub repository. To take this exercise further, conduct additional research into Linux-based security tools and grow your table of heuristics. You can also go beyond just detecting tools based on their process names, files, and directories. For example, try checking loaded kernel modules (using lsmod) or installed packages (using dpkg).
