Chapter: 1985 - Today, AI still raises ma ny questions, the same curiosity, and 
its transformative power is still highlig hted, with the difference, however, 
that it is no longer a question of limiting th e revolution to a few areas. It will 
affect all areas of human activity.  
AI is already present, everywhere around us and in our daily lives, 
without us being aware of it most of the time. Modern vehicles that are 
equipped with electronics and computer technology are equipped with AI, 
where the software analyzes data from t housands of sensors in real time and 
performs calculations to regulate fuel supply and stabilize the vehicle, as well 
as many other functions. In autonomous  vehicles, information systems take 
control: AI analyzes the data and “decides” the actions to be taken to drive 
the vehicle. Mobile phones, virtual as sistants, social networks, anti-spam 
filters, video games, search engines, medical diagnostic support systems and 
simulation platforms are some of the applications that have benefited from 
AI, though it is impossible to draw up an exhaustive list. AI applications 
multiplied, in particular, during the 1980s, in the form of expert systems, of 
which industry, as well as defense fo rces, were majo r consumers.  
The current craze for AI is part of a series of repeated cycles, so there is 
no guarantee that it will last. However, for the time being, States have been 
won over, seeing it as a new means of  achieving their ambitions: economic 
and industrial renewal, a new society, governance, AI as an instrument of 
power and might, and so on. 
In this book, we will try to understand how AI has gradually been  
integrated into defense policies, strategi es and doctrines, and, more specifically, 
into cybersecurity and cyber defense. The integration of AI into the fields of 
security and defense is the result of a long process which has its roots in  
the 1950s. Current debates on the use of AI in military affairs necessarily refer 
to debates on RMA (Revolution in Military Affairs), on changes in the 
institution of the military, its organization, doctrines and challenges, on changes 
in power relations, on weapons (arms race , militarization, control), on the law of 
armed conflict and on the form and nature of conflicts.  
This book is structured with chapters dealing with the history of AI 
(history of research, with which ar mies are closely associated, in some 
states), definitions of concepts (in what  terms is AI mentioned? How does the 
xii     Artificial Intelligence,  Cybersecurity and Cyber Defense 
military define AI and integrate it into its discourse?), policies (national 
cybersecurity strategies) and AI in military affairs (military strategies for AI, 
concepts, doctrines, cybersecurity and cyber defense, the different players). 
This book is a synthesis of current debates on the role of AI in defense 
affairs. Since AI is “cyber” by natu re, this book explores one dimension of 
the militarization of cyberspace. Is this renewed interest in AI the starting 
point for a reconfiguration of cyberspace, and for a new way of thinking 
about cybersecurity and cyber defense issues, cyber conflict and its multiple 
forms and manifestations? Are we moving towards a reconsideration of 
convictions hitherto held about the specific characteristics of cyberspace, 
such as its fluidity, the impossibility of establishing borders and the 
difficulty of marking or defending sovereignty, the impossibility of 
allocating actions, and the difficulty of controlling information? 
In this book, the reader will find nu merous bibliographical references,

this concept, the computer executes code, line by line, as programmed, and 
cannot go beyond it). AI promises precisely to break with this logic, it 
promises surprises and new worlds. Is the prospect of machines that can 
make their own decisions, formulate their own plans and “think” something 
that army commanders can dream of at the beginning of this 21st Century?
