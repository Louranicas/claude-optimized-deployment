Chapter: 1803 - As a result, its population was an extraordinary mix of French, Spanish, English, German, Scottish, Native American, Creole and African. It was Black and white and brown, Protestant and Catholic and Jewish with just a touch of vodou. It was a place of endless possibilities; the boldest dreamers had always come there, but so had the ruthless schemers.
It often was hard to tell the difference.
For much of the Civil War, Louisiana was an occupied Confederate state. It had seceded in January 1861, but slightly more than a year later a Union fleet led by Admiral David Farragut fought through Rebel strongpoints along the Mississippi to capture New Orleans. Loyalties in the city and state remained divided throughout the rest of the war. Both sides sent thousands of soldiers to fight. For a time, Louisiana had two capitals: the Union occupied territory was governed from New Orleans, while a Confederate government was set up in Shreveport.
In the aftermath of the war, as victorious northerners debated the fate of the former Confederate states, Louisiana remained an occupied territory, part of the Fifth Military District under the harsh command of General Philip Sheridan. It was a place ripe with opportunity for clever men, and thousands of northerners raced south carrying five-dollar carpetbags to stake their claims.
Among them was handsome, charismatic, twenty-two-year-old Henry Clay Warmoth. A lieutenant colonel in the Union Army, he had first been sent there personally by General Ulysses Grant in February 1864. Originally a Missouri lawyer, Warmoth was clever, personable and well-connected, but mostly very ambitious, and he immediately recognized a place where he might build a prosperous future.
Warmoth fit well. He was also a man of flexible values. While being tested for his law license, he was asked a complicated question about property rights. After the facts were stated, he was asked, “To whom does the property of the defendant belong?”
His glib response reflected his intentions—and his character. “To the lawyers, of course.”
As the war ended and Reconstruction began, he settled in New Orleans. Congress was trying to find the means to heal the nation. Smart lawyers would be needed to shape the future. Warmoth’s wartime post as a judge on the military’s provost court had allowed him to become known—and connected—in the legal community. The proverbial pot of gold was there for him; all he had to do was scoop it up.
Instead of returning to the law, he decided to pursue a potentially much more lucrative profession: politician. He was suited for politics, not being bogged down by cumbersome principles. He rose quickly in the chaotic years after the war ended. By the time he was elected governor in 1868, the violence and murders had already begun. In office, he was loud and divisive. Although he claimed to appoint “the best men in the State...the most representative and capable” to official positions, in fact, as the New York Times reported, “It is difficult to exaggerate the evils...he has brought on the state.” Other newspapers called him “a despot,” “a demagogue” and “a tyrant.”
The more they attacked him the stronger his support grew, especially among carpetbaggers and Black voters. He built and retained an almost cultlike following. And made himself a very wealthy man.
Warmoth’s divisive, controversial and corrupt policies would lead eventually to his impeachment by his political opponents. In his defense, he angrily told journalists, “I have been the best abused man...in the Union, but have seldom felt it necessary to reply to the wild and baseless charges that have been made against me...
“Every one [of several] investigations has been prompted by the most determined hostility; has been aided by ablest legal talent and has been carried on with the most unrelenting vigor...but with all the charges made against me, no man has ever produced a scintilla of evidence implicating me in a single act of official corruption or dishonor.”
During his term in office, blood would flow freely in Louisiana, from the crowded streets of New Orleans to the cotton fields of the old plantations, along the rivers and in the swamps, leading to what remains arguably the most complicated, contentious and deadliest election in American history. More than a century and a half later the consequences of Louisiana’s 1872 gubernatorial election would continue to reverberate in American politics.
Warmoth’s political career began in November 1865, only seven months after the end of the war, when the newly organized Union Republican party elected him to represent Louisiana as a nonvoting member of Congress. This was the first election in the state’s history in which Black men were permitted to vote. Many of them even contributed a few cents to a fund established to defray Warmoth’s expenses in Washington, which eventually raised an amazing $15,000—nearly $300,000 today—and gave a hint of what was to come. As Warmoth pointed out proudly, he received 19,396 votes, although he failed to mention he ran unopposed.
He was cast perfectly for the role, with a pleasantly large nose, “keen measuring eyes, a superb mustache,” high, round cheekbones and a firm chin that might have been chiseled from marble. He was almost as tall as President Lincoln, although, as he was known to point out, not when the president was wearing his top hat.
Warmoth was comfortable with powerful people and often found himself in the middle of history: he had literally walked down the great staircase in the White House next to Lincoln and been present for his second inaugural address. Less auspiciously he had met with General Grant only hours before Lincoln’s assassination and then stood in the parlor of the Kirkwood Hotel as Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the oath of office to President Andrew Johnson. And he had helped make the arrangements for Lincoln’s funeral, traveling with the cortege to New York City.
His words were as smooth and reassuring as his appearance. Supporters admired him for his refreshing candor; opponents found him loud and abrasive. His strength as a politician lay in his claim that he was not a politician. He successfully forged an image as the honest representative of the common man, which was why, he contended, powerful politicians continually attacked him. As he once told a Chicago Tribune reporter, “I don’t pretend to be honest... I only pretend to be as honest as anybody in politics. And more so than those fellows who are opposing me now.”
While he made the politically correct promises after his election, claiming he was not a partisan, pledging to uphold the law and order for all people, his election stunned and terrified white Louisianians. While the result was never in question, the turnout was astonishing. Nineteen thousand votes with no opponent? It was a warning, a harbinger of future elections. If those Black voters formed a coalition with the carpetbaggers who were just beginning to show up in large numbers throughout the South, they easily would gain control of the state government. While the defeated Confederates understood and accepted that they would pay a price for waging war, they were now realizing that their genteel society had been turned upside down. Their future was going to be determined at the ballot box. Unless they acted, their enemies and former slaves would be making—and enforcing—the laws.
They had to be stopped. Whatever it took, this new voting bloc had to be stopped.
The concept of voting for leaders can be traced back to ancient Greece, where male landowners cast ballots on shards of broken pottery to determine which—if any—politicians should be exiled. The first election in America was held in 1607, when six white male colonists in Jamestown, Virginia, elected Edward Maria Wingfield president of the governing council. Historically, the right to vote had been restricted to white male property holders, people who paid taxes and aged at least twenty-one years, the idea being that people who had a “stake in society” would be harder to influence. Voting rights remained a contentious issue after the American Revolution. John Adams railed against extending suffrage, writing, “...every man who has not a farthing, will demand an equal voice with any other in all acts of state,” and as a result it would “confound and destroy all distinctions, and prostrate all ranks to one common level.”
But Benjamin Franklin disagreed. “Today a man owns a jackass worth fifty dollars,” he proposed, “and he is entitled to vote, but before the next election the jackass dies. The man in the meantime has become more experienced, his knowledge of the principles of government and his acquaintance with mankind are more extensive, and therefore he is better qualified to make a proper selection of rulers—but the jackass is dead and the man cannot vote. Now, gentlemen, pray inform me, in whom is the right of suffrage? In the man or in the jackass?”
Each colony and later each state held the power to determine who was allowed to vote in its elections. Qualifications for voting had not been mentioned in the original Constitution. There were no national voting standards, even when electing federal government officials. Over time most of the economic tests, like having to own property or pay taxes, had disappeared. But despite a few rare instances in which the right to vote had been extended to propertied women, free Black people and even Native Americans, for the most part it had remained restricted to white men. Sometimes only to white Christian men. Although a rabble-rousing New York abolitionist named Susan B. Anthony was leading a movement to extend the right to vote to women and Black Americans, her suffrage organization had gained limited support.
Throughout the former Confederacy, especially in states such as Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, the former Rebels were organizing—preparing to fight to diminish the impact of northern Reconstruction policies. The most notable of these groups, the Ku Klux Klan, had been formed in Pulaski, Tennessee, in December 1865 by six former Confederate officers. A secret social fraternity, based loosely on existing social organizations like the Masons, its name supposedly was derived from the Greek word kuklos, meaning circle. The kuklos clan, or tightly knit familial group, quickly became known as the Ku Klux Klan.
Like other fraternities, its members created secret rituals and adopted distinctive costumes—in this case long multicolored robes and a pointed hat with eye slits cut into it. By disguising their identities, the regalia provided protection for members—as well as adding an aura of danger. While the Ku Klux Klan had not been formed specifically to intimidate people, when its members discovered their garb had that effect, the costume spread quickly throughout the South.
A local version of the Klan came to Louisiana in early 1867, when former Confederate Colonel Alcibiades DeBlanc founded a militia known as the Knights of the White Camelia. Rather than keeping their identities secret, armed members of the White Camelia marched boldly through the streets of New Orleans or patrolled dark roads at night, threatening freedmen and their white supporters.
The War Between the States, as Southerners were already referring to it, was done, but the resistance was just beginning. Violence erupted again soon after. In New Orleans on Monday, July 30, 1866, a glorious summer day, a convention to create a new state constitution was scheduled to meet at noon.
In an editorial published that morning, the conservative New Orleans Times-Picayune lauded the city’s Black population, claiming that in New Orleans there had always been “a feeling of the most kindly and friendly character” between the races. But in a formal proclamation, the city’s mayor, Democrat John T. Monroe, bluntly warned delegates not to meet. He was mostly ignored. A large group of Black men marched through the streets to celebrate the day when the constitutional convention reconvened to draft a far more radical document that granted full citizenship, including voting rights, to all Black men.
A mob of mostly ex-Confederate soldiers armed with guns, clubs and knives, organized by Mayor Monroe, was waiting for the demonstrators when they reached the Mechanics Institute, the large building in which the legislature was meeting. Seconds later the first shot was fired. The marchers rushed into the massive building for protection. But it was hopeless. Police officers joined the attackers, breaking windows and firing into the building.
It was a massacre.

It was a massacre.



The Mechanics Institute, the seat of Louisiana’s government, had been the site of an 1866 attack by white rioters trying to prevent a new state constitution from being enacted. As many as two hundred Black freedmen were killed and more than one hundred were wounded in the riot.
The Historic New Orleans Collection, 1974.25.3.271


As many as two hundred Black men were killed and many more injured. Several men who raised their arms to surrender were shot in cold blood. Those wounded were stabbed and clubbed to death. Others were killed as they prayed. Black men just passing by were pulled off streetcars and beaten or murdered.
It took more than an hour before federal troops arrived to stop the carnage. By then the floor of the Institute was caked in blood.
Dozens of men, both white and Black, were arrested but later released. The real instigators of the massacre, reported the Times-Picayune, were “reckless and unprincipled” men attempting to “regain offices and patronage which they had lost since the close of the war, by which they had raised themselves from poverty and obscurity to comparative wealth and partisan notoriety.” No one knew who had fired the first shots, but the paper alleged without any evidence it had been fired by a Black man who shot an innocent white man “standing quietly at the curbstone.”
There is no record that anyone was prosecuted for the crimes committed that day. Battle lines were being drawn. But that Monday morning it became clear that protecting democracy would require far more than an expansion of voting rights, and that more people were going to die in that fight.
The primary question that had to be answered was under what terms would the union be reconstructed? How much power would the national government have to impose laws that under the Constitution had been granted to the individual states, for example? There was no simple answer, no model on which to base decisions. Louisiana would serve as the testing ground for policies that might be applied to the rest of the Confederacy.
As one of the few people representing Louisiana’s interests in Washington, Henry Warmoth found himself in the middle of the debate, trying to help forge a political compromise that would prevent more bloodshed while furthering his own career.
Slavery would be outlawed, that was certain, but beyond that there was little consensus about other conditions. According to the Times-Picayune there was considerable evidence that shortly before he was assassinated, “Mr. Lincoln seriously inclined to the restoration of recognized states, administered by their own citizens with no other conditions than that of full fealty to the constitution.” Any “punishments and proscriptions...were few, and dictated by policy rather than revenge.” It was an extraordinary claim, and the paper offered no evidence to support it.
His successor, Democrat Andrew Johnson, who had been raised in the secessionist state of Tennessee, had very different views. His plan required the Confederate states to abolish slavery, pay their war debts and swear allegiance to the Union. In return they would retain their rights to determine how to rebuild their laws—including who would be granted the right to vote—and their economy. But under his plan, freed slaves would not receive General Sherman’s promised “forty acres and a mule,” and landowners would regain the properties they owned before the war.
Territories rejoining the Union would be bound by the three constitutional Amendments—the 13th, 14th and 15th—which formed the political foundation of Reconstruction. The Thirteenth Amendment, which had been passed by Congress in January 1865, outlawed slavery, stating, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”
The Fourteenth Amendment was passed after states began instituting black codes to lessen the impact of the Thirteenth Amendment. It granted citizenship to every person born in the United States and prohibited states from making or attempting to enforce “any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
The Fifteenth Amendment extended the right to vote to former slaves, stating it “shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” But it was intentionally loosely worded so as to allow the states to establish their own qualifications. States were still free to prevent women from voting or institute a variety of fees, tests and other hurdles to make it difficult or almost impossible for Black men to vote.
While Congress was amending the national constitution, in New Orleans, Louisiana’s legislature was slowly drafting a new state constitution. In 1864 Louisiana had become the first southern state to adopt a conciliatory constitution—although it applied only to the thirteen occupied parishes around New Orleans and Baton Rouge. It was a small first step toward rejoining the Union. In accordance with the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery was abolished without any compensation to slaveholders. Additionally, the legislature was authorized—but not compelled—to extend voting rights to Black men who had fought for the Union, owned property or were literate.
Confederate supporters organized to fight back against these radical changes. They successfully elected a Democratic mayor and legislature in New Orleans. And then they picked up weapons. July 30th’s murderous attack at the statehouse sent a message heard by every politician, every northerner, every person, Black or white. In the South, Black men could be killed with impunity.
Congress finally was forced to act, passing the Reconstruction Act of
