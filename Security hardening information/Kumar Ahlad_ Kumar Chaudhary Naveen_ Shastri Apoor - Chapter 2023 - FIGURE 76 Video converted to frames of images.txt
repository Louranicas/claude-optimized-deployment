Final authentication level is given in Figure 7.7, as shown above. The OTP will be sent to the registered mobile number.



Long Description for Figure 7.7
The "Bank Buddy" mobile banking login interface is divided into three sections. On the left, a smartphone screen titled "Select Your Bank" displays icons for various banks such as SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Axis, and Citibank arranged in a grid. The center section, labeled "Secure Authentication," features a login form with fields for "Client ID" (pre-filled with 9980), "PIN" (masked), and an empty "OTP" field. Below the fields are buttons for "Reset," "Login," and "Register." On the right, a smartphone logo with a message bubble containing the word "BANK" is displayed.

Figure 7.8 indicates the home page of the bank that is provided by the correct password and OTP by the user. The user can now login to his actual banking website to continue with the transaction.



Long Description for Figure 7.8
A web-based interface for managing client information. The interface includes a navigation bar at the top with options such as "Home," "Add Client," "View Client," "Report," and "Logout." Below the navigation bar, the title "Client Details" is prominently displayed. The form contains labeled fields for entering client information, including "Client Id," "Name," "Father Name," "Email," "Mobile Number," "Address," "City," "State," and "PAN Number." Each field has a corresponding blank text box for data entry. The interface is displayed in a browser window with the URL "127.0.0.1:4000" visible in the address bar. The operating system taskbar at the bottom shows the time as 16:04 on May 28, 2023, along with system icons for search, Wi-Fi, and other utilities.

Figure 7.9 indicates forgot pin page. If a user forgets their password, they can replace it by entering the OTP that was supplied to their cell phone. As seen in Table 7.1, our technique is contrasted with the other ways. It is evident that our approach is superior to others.



Long Description for Figure 7.9
The banking application interface consists of two main sections. On the left, a mobile phone screen displays a "Select Your Bank" menu with six diamond-shaped icons representing different banks, including SBI, HDFC, and Citibank, each labeled accordingly. The right section, titled "Secure Authentication," features a form to reset a PIN, with fields for "Client ID" (pre-filled with 1234) and an empty "OTP" input box. Below these fields, buttons for "Reset," "Change PIN," and "Register" are available. At the bottom right, the "Bank Buddy" logo with a smartphone and speech bubble containing the word "Bank" is visible. The interface is displayed on a desktop with a taskbar showing time, date, and system icons.

Table 7.1 depicts the comparison of state of art and our method. Shah [1] has introduced graphical-based authentication with image pattern and OTP. The method operates in two modes: easy and complex. The limitation of such a method is to switch over two methods. Abhijit [2] also given an algorithm for new web-based authentication system. The main drawback of the method is dependency of platform. Our method uses simple pixel-matching and frame ordering with video authentication method. The method is platform independent and the complete authentication process will take 30 seconds to complete. So our method proves to be good with reference to the reference methods.


7.5 Conclusion and Future Scope
The world is rapidly becoming digital as a result of growing technological breakthroughs takes place through online. The customer would like to do online transaction for everything like bill payment, reservations for events, banking transactions, etc. Other online activities include communication through email and messaging applications, document storage, and more. Everything moving online has increased the possibility of cybercrimes and privacy violations. The proposed method comes up with the advanced authentication system using image and video. The initial step login with username and password, followed by image pixel-matching method and finally selecting the frames from the video output. The method will give the security with three layer protection. Thus the user transactions will be kept safe. Thus the algorithm will take less than a minute to complete all the three layer of authentication process. So the proposed work proves to be good.
