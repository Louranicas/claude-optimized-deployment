Fortunately, PowerShell is equipped with excellent help features. Get-Help <command> (extended by the -Examples, -Detailed, or -Full options as required) returns comprehensive help texts for any command. If you additionally pass the -Online option, the help text will be displayed in the web browser.
The first time Get-Help is called, PowerShell may indicate that the local help files are incomplete. The solution to this problem is to run Update-Help -UICulture en-US once. The -UICulture option is necessary because most help texts are only available in English. However, download errors often occur despite this option because, for some (often smaller) modules, no help texts are available at all.
If youâ€™re looking for a command, Get-Command will always help. Without further options, it simply provides a list of all commands. Using Select-String, you can then filter the almost endless output. The following command generates a sorted list of all commands that contain the search term VM, which obviously control virtual machines:
> Get-Command | Select-String VM | Sort-Object  Add-NetEventVmNetworkAdapter  Add-NetEventVmSwitch  ... 
Get-Command offers a lot more search options. Check out Get-Help Get-Command -Examples!
