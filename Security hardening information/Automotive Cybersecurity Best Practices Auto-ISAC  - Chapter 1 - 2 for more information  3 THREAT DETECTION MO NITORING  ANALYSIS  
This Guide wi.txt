published, the Standing Committee  plans to review and update this G uide, as appropriate . 
2.0 Best Practices  
This section identifies  the primary elements  of identifying, monitoring , and analyzing threats 
across the vehicle cybersecurity  ecosystem . Companies should consider  these Best Practices 
while also referring to the Reference s and Resources listed in Appendix B , which informed the 
development of these Best Practices . 
2.1 FRAMEWORK  FOR THREAT DETECTION , MONITORING  AND ANALYSIS IN  VEHICLE CYBERSECURITY  
A cybersecurity threat detection , monitoring,  and analysis process  is an organizational capability 
designed to reduce cybersecurity risk , ideally  before an incident occurs  (i.e. before a threat 
exploits a vulnerability) . A framework for th is Guide is provided in Figure 2 , and each of the five 
functions  is explained in more detail below . It should be noted that e ach of the five functions
