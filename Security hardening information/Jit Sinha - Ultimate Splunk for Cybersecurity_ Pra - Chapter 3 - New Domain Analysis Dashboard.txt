New Domain Analysis Dashboard:

Scenario: Staff members report receiving suspicious emails that lead them to unidentified websites, leading JIT Inc. to believe that phishing attacks are being carried out using recently registered domains.
How It Helps: Access attempts to recently registered domains can be detected with the help of this dashboard. It can assist JIT Inc. in identifying possible phishing sites early on, enabling the quick blocking of such domains, and training staff members about them.
