experts extract and detail these requirements using best practices from standards like OWASP ASVS, STIG, or IEC62443. NLP has been applied in requirements engineering (RE) for analysis tasks, although its effectiveness has been uncertain. 
The chapter outlines the state-of-the-art NLP methods in RE, focusing on
