4.1 Introduction
The primary goal of developing a traffic rule violation system is to detect numerous offenses committed by defaulters on the road so that severe action can be taken against them to lower the number of fatalities brought on by accidents. Initially, monitoring a large volume of traffic on the roads was done by a single individual, which was problematic as it was more prone to errors due to limited human memory capacity [1]. To solve this issue, a system was introduced that operates 24/7 without the need for human intervention and can accurately detect multiple traffic violations with a high degree of precision. The traffic rule violation detecting system works in conjunction with a surveillance system established along highways and roads. To obtain vital information, these surveillance cameras record images of license plates from vehicles involved in infractions. Computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to process and analyze the collected photos and videos. This entails collecting relevant information from visual data, such as vehicle position, speed, lane adherence, and traffic signal status [18]. To detect instances of traffic offenses, the processed data is compared to pre‐defined rules and laws. Speeding, running red lights, inappropriate lane switching not wearing a helmet, and illegal overtaking are examples of such offenses. The diagram summarizes the operation of the traffic law violation system when connected with the highway CCTV system. To maintain the effectiveness of the traffic rule violation [13]. system, its general operation is constantly reviewed. Reports and analytics can be provided to analyze the frequency and types of infractions, find patterns, and continuously enhance the system’s effectiveness (Figure 4.1).


Figure 4.1 Illustration of violation capture process.


Another significant feature of the system is its ability to detect traffic violations caused by two‐wheeled vehicles with ease. Studies have shown that the number of two‐wheelers on the road is higher compared to other means of transportation, and so it is more common to the fatal accidents due to violation of traffic regulations [15, 18]. To decrease the number of causalities, the system has been designed and trained to detect violations of traffic rules by motorcyclists, such as driving without wearing a helmet [19]. Despite the fact that helmets are mandatory in numerous areas, there are still some riders who do not wear them, and as a result, they face severe accidents. Past observations have revealed that fatalities are increasing at an alarming rate in many developing countries as drivers avoid using helmets. Hence, the designed architecture is multipurpose and can even be extended to other traffic laws such as not wearing helmet, high speed limit, red signal crossing, and many more [9].
The main approach used by the system involves capturing an image of the offending vehicle’s number plate in order to retrieve the necessary details of the owner. This can be achieved by utilizing the surveillance systems that are already installed in both urban and rural areas [1]. Once the image is obtained, the violation is analyzed and information about the traffic rule contravention along with the fine to be paid is sent to the registered mobile number of the possessor. To make the interaction more user‐friendly, various flexible graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been designed that enable individuals to track their status easily and quickly.
Figure 4.2 elaborates on the flow of the proposed traffic rule violation detection system in accordance with the vigilance system.
The TRVDS currently in use has resolved numerous issues in terms of human resources, cost, and time. The task of monitoring millions of vehicles has been made effortless, resulting in remarkable outcomes by successfully catching violators. In this chapter, we have focused on different sections, including an introduction, adopted techniques, literature survey, conclusion, and future work.

4.2 Technologies Involved in Smart Traffic Monitoring

4.2.1 Device Involving Sensors
IoT‐based sensors are typically configured in such systems, which gather data from assets or target objects and communicate the acquired information to the centralized computer system [4]. The collected statistics play a major role as they help an individual to make better and quicker decisions. The goal of these tiny sensors is to gather all the required real‐time data [14]. Some common technologies adopted by the sensor to fetch the required details include the following (Figure 4.3):

Infrared Sensors (IR): The detection of traffic density on the road is accomplished by IR sensors, which signal the traffic light to switch from red to green or vice versa. These sensors work by measuring the infrared radiations present in the environment and tracking the movement of objects. Infrared sensors are divided into two categories: active and passive [16]. Active sensors consist of an LED and a receiver, while passive sensors include infrared filter and a Fresnel lens.
VANET: Vehicular Ad Hoc Network or VANET is a wireless network formed in an ad hoc environment where all the moving vehicles and connected objects establish a connection among themselves [13]. Through this connection, they exchange crucial information. Initially, VANET was only designed to provide comfort and safety to drivers, but currently it is also being used to accurately detect traffic violations on the road.


Figure 4.3 Technologies for monitoring traffic congestion.


RFID: The wireless approach is supported by RFID sensors that consist of two essential elements, namely tags and readers [2, 15]. The reader device includes antennas that transmit radio waves and receive signals from the tags. These tags transmit information about their identity and other characteristics to nearby objects via radio waves. RFID tags are classified into two types: active and passive. The only distinction between the two is that active tags are battery‐powered while passive ones do not require batteries. The automatic tracking and uploading of necessary information onto a centralized system by RFID eliminates the need for manual efforts, saving both time and money [4]. Additionally, the possibility of data duplication and missed items is minimized, as all collected details are electronically recorded. Figure 4.4 [2] shows tags that will be tracked, reader which will detect the RFID tags, antennas, radio waves, and computer wherein all the accumulated data will be stored.



4.2.2 Wireless Network
The term wireless network refers to a network that establishes connections between devices through radio frequencies. The distinguishing feature of wireless networks is that they keep objects connected to the network while allowing them to move around freely, without being encumbered by cables [18]. In contrast, wired networks require a large number of wires to establish a connection to the network. Wireless frequencies like Bluetooth, Wi‐Fi, and Zigbee all support the establishment of wireless networks. These networks come with various protocol variants that facilitate data communication over a large coverage area.
Wireless networks also allow for centralized management and oversight of the system, which aids in the detection of traffic offenses. It is feasible to wirelessly transmit data from sensors, cameras, and other equipment positioned throughout the road network to a central control facility. This control center is the key hub for data analysis, processing, and initiating relevant tasks. Because of wireless connectivity, the control unit can immediately identify and fix traffic violations. This can include alerting the necessary parties, automatically billing costs, or dispatching enforcement officials to the offending area [17]. Wireless networks can be compared to a system that aids in the detection of traffic offenses. They simplify data control and analysis, let vehicles to interface with infrastructure, and accelerate data transmission.

In TRVDS, these network plays a major role by initiating a seamless transmission between sensors, cameras, monitoring stations, and other components, enabling quick detection and response to traffic rule violations.


4.2.3 Computer Vision
Computer Vision is the prominent field of Artificial Intelligence that involves training computer systems to comprehend the real world. Many papers utilizing Computer Vision technology rely on the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models [3]. Traffic rule violation systems that adopt this technique begin by extracting video frames from the surveillance system. These frames are then loaded into the CNN model, where four pre‐trained layers analyze the features to identify illegal driving activities of the driver on the road. After the video frames are extracted for approximately 0.5 seconds, a DBN model is employed to make the final decision before sending the alert to the violator.
