Chapter: 7 - , “Multi-factor Authentication for Smart Internet Transactions,” explores the growing need for enhanced security measures in online communication, particularly as internet usage continues to rise. As traditional text-based passwords become increasingly vulnerable to attacks, this chapter introduces multi-level graphical password authentication as a more secure and user-friendly alternative. By allowing users to select images, patterns, or gestures for authentication, graphical passwords address the limitations of text-based methods, offering better memorability and increased resistance to dictionary-based and brute-force attacks. This chapter discusses how this approach not only enhances security by expanding the search space but also provides a more inclusive experience, benefiting users who may struggle with alphanumeric passwords or have visual impairments. By integrating graphical and multi-factor authentication, this chapter highlights innovative solutions to safeguard sensitive information in smart internet transactions.
