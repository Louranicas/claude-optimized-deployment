1.4.2.4 Digital Libraries 
To obtain results for this study, we opted to search two primary digital libraries that 
are 
commonly utilized in PLC engineering: IEEE Xplore1 and Scopus.2 
1.4.2.5 Selection Criteria 
To establish the relevance of studies obtained from our search, we have developed a 
set 
of selection criteria, which are classiﬁed as either inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
A study is deemed eligible if it meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Conversely, a study is excluded if it meets at least one exclusion criterion or fails to meet all the inclusion criteria. The selection process is conducted 
in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, papers are assessed based on their title, abstract, and 
keywords, and in the second stage, the full text of the papers is examined. Inclusion criteria are listed as follows:
