Chapter: 3 - AI research in Russia 
The history of AI in Russia follows roughly the same chronology as that 
of the United States or the West. As early as the early 1960s, Western 
delegations visiting Russia noticed the presence of research teams on AI 
themes.  
The report by E.A. Feigenbaum, who vi sited the USSR from June to July 
1960 as a member of the American delegation to the First Congress of the 
International Federation of Automatic Control  (IFAC) [FEI 60] said: 
“The program consisted of a number of welcoming speeches, and 
an address by the well-known scien tist and Chairman of the USSR 
National Committee for Automatic Control, V.A. Trapeznikov.”  
“The Soviet Deputy Premier talked on the problems which 
automation would bring to ‘certain societies’ which were not 
well equipped to handle this kind of technological change – 
change which would bring unemployment, re-education 
problems […]”  
“In general, Soviet papers could be characterized as oriented 
toward theory, while papers of Western delegates mixed theory 
and application.”  
“In conjunction with the conference,  various research institutes, 
educational institutions, and plan ts were officially opened for 
technical excursions by the delegates […] By far, the most 
popular tour was one to the Institute of Automation and 
Telemechanics in Moscow.” 
In the Soviet Union, AI was one of the components of cybernetics, in the 
same way as information theory, computer science or the study of military 
C2 [LEV 64]. Cybernetics, which appeared in the USSR in 1953, was a new 
and broad field, organized around various research communities which come 
10     Artificial Intelligence,  Cybersecurity and Cyber Defense 
together, in particular, at conferences dedicated to cybernetics and in 
numerous academic publications from th e early 1960s. Military cybernetics 
became a sub-domain of cybernetics.  
An article published in the journal Science  on August 27, 1965 [KOP 65] 
introduced a new city of science, whic h had just been built, in Siberia: 
Akademgorodok, located in the s uburbs of Novosibirk (Siberia).  
The work of Paul R. Josephson [JOS  97] gives a whole chapter to the 
history of the birth of AI in the city of Akademgorodok, in the middle of the 
Soviet period (1960–1970). For it was there that AI in Russia was born. A 
Russian research communi ty centered on AI was created there in the 1970s, 
with a university research center, “c lubs” (“Akademia” club on Artificial 
Intelligence)6 and a Council for AI (the Artificial Intelligence Council)7, etc. 
The city, now considered one of Russia’s Silicon Valleys (along with 
Moscow and St. Petersburg), is said to be home to Russia’s “cyberwar 
soldiers” [CLA 17]. Akademgorodok is home to a technopark, concentrating 
24% of the revenue of all Russian te chnoparks, and 22% of the companies 
hosted in Russia in technoparks [LOG 16]. The Akademgorodok technocenter 
is currently reported to host 340 companies, 115 start-ups and nearly 10,000 
employees. This ecosystem is compleme nted by the many university research 
centers that have made the city fa mous and unique, due to their high 
concentration.  
In the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union envisaged the use of networked 
information technology as a tool for controlling, managing and planning for the 
Soviet economy. The project envisaged at that time was to link major 
production and political centers using a vast network of computers. Moscow 
would be the hub, but it would also pass through Leningrad (as St. Petersburg 
was called at the time) and Kiev. Implementation was to start around 1975 
and be fully operational by 1990. Western, American (Control Data 
Corporation) and British (International Computers, Ltd.) companies were 
even involved in this project [LIE 73]. The computer and computer science, 
in the broad sense, was a tool of the Soviet political project, as well as posing a 
challenge to America which at that poi nt faced difficulties in implementing 
such networks on a large scale. Sovi et technological deve lopment was based
