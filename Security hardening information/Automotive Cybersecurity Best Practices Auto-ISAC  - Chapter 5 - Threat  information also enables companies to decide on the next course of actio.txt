2.2 BEST PRACTICES FOR DEFINING A THREAT DETECTION AND ANALYSIS PROCESS   
The scope  of a threat detection and analysis pro cess may encompass any relevant vehicle 
cybersecurity  threats , including  those  that originate from  both internal and external sources 
throughout design, development , and post -production processes . Choosing the appropriate threat  
scope  (which can vary  from organization to organization)  is fundament al for effective  threat 
detection and analysis . 
2.2.1 Threat Team Structure and Operating Model  
The threat team may draw upon a companyâ€™s broader vehicle focused cybersecurity team or other 
appropriate stakeholders as it creates collection requirements,  reviews intelligence, validates 
threats, and creates  actionable intel ligence analysis. The  threat t eam can potentially benefit from
