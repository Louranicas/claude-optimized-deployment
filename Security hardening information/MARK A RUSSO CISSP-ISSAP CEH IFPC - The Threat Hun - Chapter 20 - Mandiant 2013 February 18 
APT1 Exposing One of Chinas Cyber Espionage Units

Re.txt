“Hunts” follow the process outlined below. This ensures that all
hunts provide feedback and value to the company, business, or agency.
They require a consistent and repeatable response.  The THP also requires
“continual improvement” element like many mainstream development
processes such as the Information Technology Information Library®
(ITIL).  Continual improvement requires, for example, after-action
meetings, training, and outside third-party evaluation on a recurring basis;
these are but several measures designed to improve the organizations’
cybersecurity threat response activities and capabilities.
 
 
 
Threat Inputs
 
Cybersecurity Analysts (CyA) will begin hunts based on
received 
hunt requests
[3]
 or 
base hunts
 from the Incident Response Team
and generated by a developed 
Master Hunt Tracking Database (MHTDB).
The MHTDB is a defined repository that tracks Indicators of Compromise
(IOC) that assist in determining who and what level of attack is deployed
based upon such indicators, intelligence, patterns of attack, etc., that assists
in formulating a better understanding of threat capabilities and motivations
within the target IT environment. IOCs may be developed from internal
experts, but there are several low-cost and no-cost solutions already
developed for the public and private sectors use for their companies and
agencies.
 
These include:
 
1
. 
FireEyes’s ® publicly shared IOC’s of Github at:
https://github.com/fireeye/iocs
2
. 
The DHS shares Joint Indicator Bulletins at: 
https://www.us-
cert.gov/ncas/bulletins
3
. 
DHS also offers Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS).  More
information on how to integrate with these services may be found
at: 
https://www.dhs.gov/ais
4
. 
Crowdstrike® also offers IOC access via its Falcon Query API.

. 
Also, work being done in Artifical Intelligence (AI) by the
company Cylance® is also providing cutting-edge approaches for
end-point protection. See

Hunt
 
Activity
 
Hunt requests may originate from the following three functional
areas; however, final determination for the action is the responsibility of the
IR team (based on the immediacy may also be in coordination with senior
management for alert and visibility purposes.
