# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Debrupa Palit - Cybersecurity Today_ Cyber attacks, network security, and threat prevention (2024) - libgen.li
Chapter: 3 - Wi-Fi technology allows network devices to connect and communicate over the Internet using radio frequency (RF) signals.
Wireless network security is the comprehensive practice of designing, implementing, and maintaining security measures for a wireless computer network. This subset of network security focuses specifically on safeguarding wireless networks. It includes deploying multiple security mechanisms, including encryption, authentication, access control, and intrusion detection. The primary objectives are to ensure data transmitted over wireless networks' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Wireless network security is essential for preventing unauthorized access to your data. Wi-Fi networks use radio waves to transmit data; therefore, they are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. This means that Wi-Fi signals can potentially interrupt and access the sent data.
Cyberattacks are becoming very common these days and can cause huge consequences on the security of wireless networks. Hackers can access all the sensitive information, such as credit card details or any other passwords. They can also take full control of your devices, which will cause identity theft and lead to big financial losses.
To protect all your devices from these risks, it is crucial to have wireless network security to save and protect your data. You can easily keep all your personal information safe from hackers by taking a few safety measures to secure your device.
Wireless networks employ various encryption protocols like WEP, WPA, and WPA2 to secure data transmission. WEP was designed to provide basic encryption for wireless networks but has known vulnerabilities. WPA improves upon WEP by using the TKIP for encryption, offering stronger security. WPA2, an advanced iteration of WPA, supports TKIP and Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP), using the AES for robust data encryption. Devices certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance integrate WPA/WPA2 encryption to ensure secure wireless communication, protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches.
Some best practices for enhancing wireless network security are described in Figure 6.6:

Some best practices for enhancing wireless network security are described in Figure 6.6:

Implement two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA to add an additional layer of security, requiring users to enter a username, password, and a unique code generated by an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.
Use strong passwords: Create strong passwords with 8 to 10 characters, including a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. Regularly update passwords to strengthen security.
Encrypt data: Encrypt data before transmission to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Educate employees on the importance of data encryption and its methods.
Enable WPA3 Security: Use the latest wireless security protocol, WPA3, on routers to ensure robust protection against security vulnerabilities associated with older protocols like WPA
