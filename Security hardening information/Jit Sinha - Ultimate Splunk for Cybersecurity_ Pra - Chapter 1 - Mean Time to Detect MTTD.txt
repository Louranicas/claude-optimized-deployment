Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

Splunk ES Application: The MTTD can be computed using real-time analytics and monitoring made possible by Splunk ES. Because of the platform’s extensive logging and alerting features, SOCs can detect security events promptly.
Improvement Strategy: Refine alert criteria and cut noise with Splunk’s data analytics to possibly lower MTTD.
