Chapter: 30 - Twitchell had picked about twenty men to escort them, led by a trusted local citizen named John Carr. They had tried to keep their route secret. Rather than staying on the main road, they took a path along the river. They rode hard toward Shreveport.
They rode through the morning, slowing when they got near the Hutchinson Plantation, about thirty-five miles from Coushatta. They intended to cross the Red River there, then destroy their flatboat to ensure nobody could follow them.
They never made it.
Once again, there are different versions of what happened next. Some people said that soon after the officials and their guards left Coushatta, a group of forty to fifty men, Texans supposedly, took off after them. Others claimed that a large group of men, as many as one hundred, coming from Texas to join the fight, ran right into them. There were even some stories that members of the guard had arranged a rendezvous with a gang from DeSoto Parish led by a hard-core killer known as “Captain Jack” Coleman. Any of those scenarios are possible, and several years later Carr was identified as a White League captain responsible for at least two deaths in Bienville Parish. People noted the prisoners were attacked right after they entered Bossier Parish, which was known to be far friendlier to white supremacists than Red River. But everyone agreed that when the prisoners saw the posse coming, they made a run for the river. But there was no escape.
The outgunned guards were told, “Git outta the way or share their fate.”
Supposedly, Homer Twitchell begged for a gun to protect himself, screaming, “I don’t want to die like a dog.” Seconds later he was shot in his face. Edgerton and Dewees were murdered where they stood. Howell, Holland and Willis were taken a short distance into the woods and killed.
All of the victims were stripped of their valuables and their money stolen. A large bankroll was taken from one of them. Their bodies were described as “horribly mutilated,” one of them “so gashed and perforated with bullets that it could scarcely be moved.”
It would be several weeks before anyone was arrested for the Coushatta Massacre, as people had begun referring to it. By late October several hundred warrants had been issued for the Red River murders as well as for threatening freedmen and Republican officeholders. Cavalry troops swept into Shreveport and neighboring parishes to make arrests. The troops put on a great show but accomplished very little.
Most of those men they were looking for had been warned and either fled “to take shelter in the woods under the canopy of heaven” or simply couldn’t be found. Only thirteen men were apprehended, Captain Abney among them. They were taken under guard to New Orleans. All of them were released on $5,000 bond. From time to time, through the next months, other warrants were made public, and several additional men were arrested—and just as quickly bailed out.
No one was ever prosecuted for those crimes.
But those six murders were only the beginning. White Leaguers remaining in Coushatta must have felt cheated. They had gotten no satisfaction. But there was still the Dickson shooting to be resolved. Someone had to pay for ambushing the kid. Two freedmen, Paul Williams and Lewis Johnson, had been arrested and charged with the shooting. Williams supposedly confessed, although obviously under duress: “I shot Mr. J. R. Dickson; I did; now gentlemen you can take me and shoot me or hang me as you please.”
In his confession he conveniently implicated Homer Twitchell, claiming Twitchell had ordered them to fire on any white people who came to his house. It was Twitchell who warned that if they did not kill the white men, the white men would kill them. Williams had no choice, he pleaded: Twitchell, Sheriff Edgerton and Robert Dewees, the DeSoto Parish tax collector, had threatened, bullied and terrified men into following them.
Williams’s confession did not save him. As Williams and Johnson were being taken to jail, as many as seventy-five men “some mounted and some on foot came up, took them from the guard and swung them to a limb.” When reporting it, Republican newspapers pointed out that normally suspected criminals are tried first, then hanged, as opposed to what took place.
According to a federal committee that later investigated these killings, a third freedman, Eli Allen, “was taken from his house by the White League, slowly tortured to death by being shot first in one limb and the others until all were broken, and after being rendered helpless, a fire was built upon his head.”
The whole episode was a terrible tragedy, Abney solemnly admitted, but the blame lay with Homer Twitchell. He wanted a violent confrontation. By starting this uprising, he was going to force his men to fight to protect themselves, then “proclaim white people were venting their hatred...and that it was necessary to put down the ‘new ku-klux’ by Federal power.” That would force President Grant or Governor Kellogg to send soldiers into the parish to protect Republican government officials. It was his way of putting an end to the insurrection. The rebellion would stop there.
If that actually was a plan, it nearly worked.
News of the massacre stunned the country. By now northerners were used to reading stories in which Black Southern men had been murdered. It happened every day. But this...this was different. These were white government officials just doing their job. Other white people could identify with them. This seemed an attack on democracy.
In response, Governor Kellogg sent a furious telegraph to President Grant, informing him that “a more wanton outrage was never committed in any civilized community,” and asking for federal assistance. Kellogg also declared martial law and offered an extraordinary $5,000 reward for the capture and conviction of any of the participants. There was little else he could do, though: his political enemies were closing in on him.
White League supporters loudly argued that race had nothing to do with the killings: the victims had been corrupt white officials. Democratic newspapers reminded readers that all of the freedmen who had been arrested in Coushatta had been released without any harm. League leaders issued a statement denying any involvement in the murders, placing the blame on those unidentified Texans. Their fight, they claimed, was against all Republicans, especially the northerners who had despoiled their State. It wasn’t the color of their skin; it was the way they voted.
The people who really bore the responsibility, they insisted, were Ulysses S. Grant, William Pitt Kellogg and the rest of the thieves who had stolen the election. Even Henry Warmoth deserved a share of the blame.
President Grant moved cautiously. Every decision had a political impact. He responded to Kellogg’s request by instructing the secretary of the army to move troops already in Louisiana to places where their presence might make a difference. But he made sure to add that those soldiers could not be used to prevent any legal political or party actions. In reality, all that happened was that the few companies of soldiers were moved into more visible positions.
The attacks on Republican officials continued. Congress would eventually report DeSoto Parish was so lawless that “No prominent Republican can make a speech or openly act with the Republican party...except at the extreme risk of his life. Cases of persecution, destruction of crops and driving from their homes by White League desperadoes are almost without number...”
The White League continued to grow in numbers and power. No other organization since the beginning of Reconstruction had been as successful in fighting Republican rule. What made it especially effective was that rather than having central leadership dictating their actions, it remained a loose association of smaller groups, each of them acting independently in responding to their local issues.
If there was a leader, it was their “Governor,” John McEnery, who had maintained his hold on his supporters since the disputed election. Every drop of blood could be traced directly back to his refusal to concede. But McEnery was more their representative, keeping the debate alive, than someone who exercised active control.
The Republican media tried to tie McEnery to the “Coushatta outrage,” writing that he had been in that town two days before the uprising and had made a fiery speech, adding that even after the killings he refused to rebuke the murder of defenseless men. The New York Times reported that McEnery “in set speeches advised the white people to organize, arm and drive Republicans from the State...to resist even United States troops. McEnery going so far as to say that Grant would not dare to use United States troops against them.”
In a letter to the editors of the largest newspapers McEnery angrily denied the accusation: he had made no such speech, he wrote, he had never even been in Coushatta. He had never “counseled or advised our people to deeds of violence and lawlessness.” All he had done was point out the crimes committed against the good people of the State, try to assume the post those people had given him and, when that was denied him, “protect society against the ravages of official plunderers and spoliators.”
There was one last piece of the tragedy to be played out. State Senator Marshall Twitchell finally returned to Coushatta two years after the murders of his brother and brother-in-law. On May 2, 1876, Twitchell and his other brother-in-law, tax collector George King, were coming to the town to attend a grand jury meeting. While most of the men in town were at the courthouse collecting their mail, which had just arrived, a stranger rode into town. He was well disguised, wearing a false beard, black goggles and an India rubber longcoat, which was closed at the collar and came down to his shoes, covering up his clothing.
He stopped at the blacksmith’s to have his horse shod. He sat there for two hours, watching the river landing. As the skiff carrying Twitchell and King across the river came closer, he wandered down to the bank. Just as the boat was landing, without a word he pulled a sixteen-shot Henry rifle from under his coat and opened fire. His first shot hit Twitchell in the thigh.
King pulled a pistol and got off two shots that went wide. The stranger fired again, hitting King in the head, killing him instantly.
Twitchell leaped into the river, grabbing hold of the skiff with his left arm, trying to hide behind it for protection. The stranger shot him in that arm. Twitchell pulled himself around to the other side and held on with his right arm. The stranger shot him in that arm too. Too much: Twitchell let go and began floating helplessly down the river.
The ferryman, Old Dennis, rowed to him and tried to pull him back into the skiff. The stranger kept shooting, taking off one of Old Dennis’s fingers.
A townsman on the other side of the river fired several shots at the stranger, missing him completely. Another man approached, but the stranger pointed his rifle at him and warned, “G-d d—n your soul. Get.” He did.
The stranger mounted his horse and rode down the river. Chasing the drifting boat. Pulling a Remington six-shooter, he fired several more shots. Old Dennis screamed at the shooter to stop; the deed was done, Twitchell was dead. The shooter turned his horse and rode out of town. He had fired twenty-two times.
Several people watched him go. He was in no hurry. No one followed him.
But with his lie, Old Dennis had saved Twitchell’s life. He managed to get the wounded man to land. An army surgeon amputated one arm right away; his other arm was taken off twenty-eight days later. Somehow, he survived.
Although the usual $5,000 reward was offered, the assassin’s identity was never learned; although, many people remarked how unusual it was that the man had been in town several hours before Twitchell’s arrival without anyone approaching him. Also, he was allowed to calmly ride out of town, and the sheriff proved reluctant to pursue him. The conservative papers named a suspect and a motive, claiming the shooter was a Radical Republican to whom Twitchell had offered a $1,000 bribe to fix the returns in DeSoto Parish—who had ambushed Twitchell because he had reneged on the deal.
That accusation was immediately disproved, as several people had seen the accused man in New Orleans the day of the shooting.
Congressional testimony eventually suggested the shooter was the notorious “Captain Jack” Coleman, but that was never proved. Twitchell told reporters “although he cannot shake hands with friend or foe and that doctors have to feel in odd places for his pulse, he will hereafter give more attention to his brain, his only source to earn a livelihood.” Eventually, he was appointed a government consul, assigned to Kingston, Canada.
The White League continued to act with impunity: the list of threats, attacks and killings was long and seemingly endless. John Wesley, a white man who taught Black children, was run out of Coushatta the same day the doomed town officials were arrested. Jack Cawton was pulled out of his house and shot for voting Republican. Richard Bonner, soon after being elected constable, was poisoned. James Williams was shot by “Captain Jack.” Officials were run out of towns and villages throughout the state. Few people were arrested. No one was ever tried or convicted.
However, for months the uprising had been restricted to the countryside. Republicans retained control of the cities, especially New Orleans. But slowly the noose was tightening. The White League had officially announced its presence in the city in June 1873, when the Crescent City Democratic Club was officially reorganized as the Crescent City White League. Fred N. Ogden was elected president.
Every public document proclaimed this to be a nonviolent movement. It was a political organization. It had no secret handshakes or passwords; its members didn’t dress in distinctive clothing. No one hid his identity. Republican newspapers noted cautiously that the club was not a danger “so long as its operations are restricted to drumming up voters.” Supporters compared it to “The League and the Covenant,” a document written and circulated exactly one hundred years earlier by Samuel Adams and Boston’s Committee of Correspondence which proposed citizens join together to protest British oppression.
But its stated purpose was far more ominous: it intended to wrest the state from Republican control. After the ’72 election debacle, and with the continuing presence of a heavily armed, well-trained Metropolitan Police force and state militia defending Kellogg, they knew this could not be accomplished at the ballot box.
As club membership swelled into the thousands, the League adopted a more military structure. It organized into dozens of companies and appointed officers; its members marched and drilled in private clubs and ballrooms and through the streets of the city. Flags and banners were held high. Bands played “Dixie” and the other songs that lived in their hearts. White women and children cheered as their men marched by torchlight. Veterans marched alongside boys too young to have served in the war. And all of them, the young and the old, men and women, felt the stirrings of lost pride. It was time to seize control of their lives, of their state, of their country.
Secretly, they began buying surplus Civil War weapons.
No one dared stop them. The rebellion had come to New Orleans.

In the parishes, small towns and villages throughout rural Louisiana, the White League had sharpened the tools needed to overthrow the Republican government. It had used violence, intimidation, pride and propaganda to inflame an already-angry populace. It had been emboldened by the impotence of President Grant’s administration to stop them. Rather than defending local governments, federal troops had been withdrawn from the state. When challenged, Republican officials were resigning, often leaving town rather than offering any resistance. Kellogg’s control had been reduced to the cities.
In Washington, committees continued meeting regularly to try to resolve the election confusion, or to place blame for Colfax and Coushatta and numerous other despicable acts of violence. After almost two years of investigation and debate, the Senate still refused to seat Pinchback or anyone else.
Grant’s declaration months earlier in support of Kellogg’s administration had made little real impact. Words were meaningless. The White League heard a very different message in his inaction: the president was unwilling or unable to provide the military support the governor needed to retain power.
Two years after the contested election, after all the political maneuvering, after all the intimidation and the endless violence, it all came down to New Orleans.
In 1874 New Orleans was America’s ninth-largest city. It was the leading port in the South. It arguably was the most successfully integrated major city in the nation, the home of Thomy Lafon, the country’s wealthiest Black merchant. It was widely considered America’s most exotic city: a wondrous mélange of cultures and races and religions, the home of Mardi Gras and voodoo; poker had been invented in New Orleans, opera had been introduced to America there. It was a place of fine restaurants and smoke-filled joints, a place where plantation society met the newly arrived Sicilian Mafia, where One-Eyed Sal and Bricktop Johnson walked the streets and any desire could be fulfilled.
And now it was to stake another claim on American history.
It was all about the guns. The state militia and the Metropolitan Police were outmanned, but until now they had not been outgunned. They were well equipped with rifles and cannon. But throughout the summer the White League had quietly been buying cheap surplus weapons and ammunition. It had been arming its men for what was to come. By late May steamboat crewmen were whispering that just about every boat leaving New Orleans was delivering guns to Leaguers in river towns.
The Second Amendment had granted Americans the right to bear arms, but exactly what that meant continued to be debated. It was widely agreed that people needed guns to hunt and, in dangerous places like the frontier, to protect their families. The concept that ordinary people needed guns in their homes to defend themselves had taken hold after the war. But Americans also recognized that guns were inherently dangerous, and it benefited society to limit ownership. Politicians were trying to determine which gun laws made the most people safe, while not abrogating their constitutional rights. Different states had interpreted the Constitution differently and passed unique laws. Gun ownership had always been regulated—and restricted. As early as 1619, Virginia passed laws to prevent felons, foreigners—and Native Americans—from owning firearms. In 1637, Massachusetts Bay barred outspoken members of the colony whose opinions “seduced and led into dangerous errors” from possessing “guns, pistols, swords, powder, shot and match.” Through the ensuing decades states had tailored laws to fit their needs; in different places guns had been legally confiscated, registered and even taxed. Even the definition of a gun varied: in some states it referred only to a long gun, musket or rifle, while in others it included pistols and derringers. Various court decisions found that arms referred specifically to weapons that might be used by the military or generally to any firearm.
The only restriction on which all states agreed was that slaves could not be allowed to have guns. The danger of an armed uprising was deemed too great. But during the war the North had enlisted, trained and armed almost two hundred thousand Black troops. In fact, Louisiana’s 73rd Regiment of the United States Colored Troops were the first Black troops to engage in combat in American history. The postwar Amendments granted them all the rights of citizenship, including gun ownership. After several states passed black codes to prevent freedmen from possessing guns, then General Grant said that those laws were “unjust, oppressive and unconstitutional.”
To try to limit the spreading gun violence during the Reconstruction, the federal Department of the South issued regulations prohibiting members of organizations “not belonging to the military or naval forces of the United States”—the Ku Klux and White League, for example—from possessing weapons.
Louisiana had long regulated guns. A law passed in 1813, less than a year after the state joined the union, prohibited carrying concealed weapons and granted police the right to stop and search anyone suspected of being armed. Those laws were tightened in 1855 after a series of murders, making even partial concealment of a firearm a crime. An 1831 New Orleans law made it illegal for anyone to enter “a public ballroom with any cane, stick, sword, or any other weapon.”
After the Civil War Louisiana tried to find legal means of preventing freed Black men from possessing guns. The state’s 1868 constitution, acknowledging that the Second Amendment begins with the phrase A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, declared that the right to bear arms applied specifically to members of the state militia. Therefore, only weapons that might be used by those people were entitled to constitutional protection. A pistol, the state Supreme Court ruled, “was not an arm for war purposes” and therefore could be regulated by the legislature. In 1870, to further limit gun ownership Warmoth instituted a tax, which made it even more difficult for the poor to keep weapons—although, it appears pistols were not included.
These laws ensured the state militia and police would not be outgunned. Beginning with the earliest settlements two centuries earlier, local governments had provided weapons and ammunition to militiamen—who often could not afford to buy their own guns—for the protection of all its citizens. The fact that a majority of Louisiana’s state militia were former slaves and war veterans terrified white supremacists like McEnery, “Lieutenant Governor” Penn and White League leader Frederick Ogden. If they were to rid the state of the Kellogg regime, they had to arm their men. Legally or illegally, they had to put guns in their hands.
Buying the weapons was not difficult. The country was flooded with readily available, cheap rifles after the Civil War. Belgian rifles could be bought for as little as two dollars apiece. While Louisiana was still reeling from the Coushatta Massacre, the first shipment of surplus weapons arrived, smuggled in aboard the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad in crates marked Machinery. They were delivered to a local foundry building and distributed to League members, who took them home and hid them.
It was impossible to keep the operation secret. The whole city was trembling with anticipation: a revolution was brewing. It was just a matter of when. The White League was going to rid the state of the carpetbaggers and scalawags. And equally important, they were going to teach a memorable lesson to those former slaves who had risen to power. They were going to take back control of their lives and their futures. They were going to be Southerners once again.
As soon as they got the guns.
An audacious plan was discussed. With luck, Kellogg could be overthrown without a single shot fired. Several White Leaguers would take positions near the State House. When a prearranged signal was given they would rush the building, capture Kellogg and other administration officials, put them aboard a waiting steamer and carry them out to sea. They would be kept incommunicado long enough to allow McEnery to assume office. Decent white citizens would take to the streets, they would support the new governor in such great numbers that Grant would have no choice but to recognize the new governor.
It seemed like a reasonable plan. It would require few men, could be done quickly and could be accomplished without shedding blood. But McEnery finally decided against it, fearing it left too much to chance.
Meanwhile, more guns arrived. Early on the morning of September 8, Metropolitans in citizens’ garb watched from the shadows as a shipment of seventy-two Prussian and Belgian rifles was delivered to Olivier’s Gun Shop at 80 Canal Street. At three o’clock that afternoon, a wagon stopped in front of the store, and three crates were loaded onto it. Two blocks later Metropolitans swarmed the wagon and took the boxes of guns to police headquarters. Hours later two crates filled with ammunition were seized.
In a statement to the press, Metropolitan Police Superintendent Badger said that the weapons were banned as White League ordnance, they were intended for irresponsible parties, and an entirely legal warrant had been issued and enforced.
Few people had seen the actual seizure, but as news spread that the police had confiscated privately owned guns, an angry crowd gathered outside the gun shop to protest. This could not be allowed! It set a dangerous precedent. The Second Amendment protected the right of private citizens to own guns. If they let the police take these guns no one knew where they would stop.
And if their guns were taken away from them, the only people who would have guns served the government. And they did not trust the government.
The Metropolitans did not back down. The next morning several detectives burst into Mr. Olivier’s shop, grabbed three more crates of rifles marked “boots, shoes and dry goods” and arrested Arthur Olivier for aiding and abetting certain persons in obtaining arms to be used for riotous purposes.
The raid lasted only a few minutes: the police were gone with the guns before protestors had time to organize. The rumor spread that there would be an attack on the police to recover the guns. General Badger kept several hundred officers on alert inside the stations through the night.
Innocent actions assumed a darker tone. On Sunday evening two Black officers arrested an elderly white man walking home carrying a musket. The policemen, the Picayune reported on its front page, “wanted to know what he meant by carrying a gun in the streets of New Orleans.” He was detained “on the frivolous charge of carrying concealed guns; frivolous because it being impossible...to carry a musket concealed.” While the man was released his gun was added “to the monstrous collection of stolen guns that now fill the police station.”
The story concluded, “The negro policeman stated that the carrying of guns would no longer be tolerated in the city.”
The meaning was obvious: the government was coming for your guns.
Governor Kellogg tried to defuse the tension, telling the media, “No attempt has been made, or will be made to interfere with the buying, selling, keeping or bearing of arms for private purposes or self-defense...”
Those people claiming the government was violating their Second Amendment rights were troublemakers, he said, men who had “garbled” the meaning of the constitution: “Look at the whole article—the entire sentence—for the extract quoted is only half a sentence. The article reads, ‘A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.’ In other words, Congress shall make no law inhibiting the states from maintaining a militia—the right of the people to bear arms as constituent members of the militia of the State shall not be infringed. This is all any candid man claimed this clause meant.”
He was seizing guns, he maintained, “to maintain law and order; the citizens are to be protected... It is preposterous to suppose for a moment that the government can allow political bodies to arm themselves in defiance of State laws while openly avowing their intention to war upon the constituted authorities.”
As for McEnery and his supporters, “These troubles are generally fomented by designing politicians who have axes to grind and want the masses, who are their dupes, to turn the grindstone; and when they have pushed the unthinking and inexperienced into the breach, these fomenters of political disturbance will generally be found in safety or protected by some subterfuge.”
His explanation made no difference. The situation had gone too far to be calmed by the words of a widely despised politician.
The next shipment of White League guns was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans aboard the steamer Mississippi on September
