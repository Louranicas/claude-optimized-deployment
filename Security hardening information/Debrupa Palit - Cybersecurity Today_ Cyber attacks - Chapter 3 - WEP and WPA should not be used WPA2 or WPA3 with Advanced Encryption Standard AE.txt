Chapter: 3 - WEP and WPA should not be used; WPA2 or WPA3 with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption should be used if available.
The default login username and password should be changed. By default, most routers use admin as the username and password to access the router console page. Changing the default username and password makes it difficult to access the router console.
The default Internet Protocol address (IP address) to access the router console should be changed. Usually, router consoles can be accessed by querying 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 on a browser. Changing this default IP address makes accessing the console page and trying various password combinations difficult.
DHCP should be turned off, and only static IP addresses should be assigned to devices on the network.
Remote access to the router should be disabled. Many routers allow remote access to the console, making the router more vulnerable to attacks conducted over the Internet.
Keep the router firmware updated to the latest version to prevent exploitation of flaws and vulnerabilities present in older versions.
Use a firewall to allow legitimate traffic within the network. Proper firewall settings should be configured on the router page to allow only certain types of traffic while denying others.
VLAN isolation should segregate the network and allow devices to be placed in specific VLANs.

Wi-Fi encryption protocols
Wireless security encryption is categorized into four primary protocols, as described in Figure 6.2:

WEP
WPA
WPA2
WPA3


Figure 6.2: Types of Wi-Fi encryption protocols
WEP
WEP was once a standard wireless security protocol for encryption. However, it is now widely regarded as insecure due to vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. WEP employs 64-bit and 128-bit encryption keys to secure web traffic and enable connections to wireless-security-enabled networks. Each authorized system within the network uses the same static key for exchanging encrypted messages, ensuring that message content remains concealed from unauthorized users without the key. This key-based encryption method protects the confidentiality of communications over the wireless network. WEP uses a shared key authentication system and a weak encryption algorithm, making it susceptible to packet sniffing and key cracking attacks. As a result, WEP has largely been replaced by more secure protocols like WPA and WPA2, which offer more robust encryption and improved security features for wireless networks.
WEP was implemented in LAN connections to safeguard against unauthorized access by encrypting data transmitted over the network. This security measure aimed to prevent privacy breaches from unauthenticated users attempting to access the LAN.
WPA
WPA is an enhanced encryption standard designed to strengthen Wi-Fi network security, offering improved data encryption and user authentication compared to its predecessors. WPA was developed to rectify the static key vulnerability present in WEP. WPA utilizes the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to dynamically generate a unique key for each packet transmitted on the network, enhancing security by reducing available information for potential attackers and thwarting unauthorized key creation. With a 128-bit encryption key and message integrity checks, this approach helps detect if data packets have been intercepted or tampered with. Despite these advancements, vulnerabilities in WPA prompted the development of WPA
