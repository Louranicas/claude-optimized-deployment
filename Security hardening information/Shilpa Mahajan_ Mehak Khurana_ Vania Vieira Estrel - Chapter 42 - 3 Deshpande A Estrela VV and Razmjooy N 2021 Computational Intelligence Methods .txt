8Performance Analysis of Intrusion Detection System Using ML Techniques

8.1 Introduction
In today’s speedily growing technological landscape, guaranteeing the safety of documents and systems has turned into a vital task. With the ever‐growing complexity of cyber threats and the escalating number of attackers, the development of robust defense mechanisms has become a top priority. This has led to the growth of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which play an important role in safeguarding these digital environments. An IDS functions as a surveillance mechanism, identifying potentially malicious actions, and producing notifications upon their discovery. These notifications enable a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst to examine the situation and implement necessary measures to address the identified risk [1]. There are three major types of IDS‐ Host‐based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS), Network‐based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), and a hybrid of the two. HIDS focuses its attention on individual host machines within a network [2]. It monitors system logs, file activities, and host‐specific events to identify potential security breaches, such as unauthorized modifications to critical files or suspicious user behaviors. On the other hand, NIDS functions at the network level, analyzing the incoming and outgoing traffic flows. By analyzing network packets and assessing communication patterns, NIDS can detect anomalous activities, such as unauthorized access attempts, denial‐of‐service attacks, and other suspicious behaviors. The hybrid IDS amalgamates the capabilities of NIDS and HIDS, offering a comprehensive approach that leverages network‐wide and host‐specific insights to enhance threat detection and response. A pivotal advancement in the field of cybersecurity lies in the infusion of Machine Learning (ML) techniques into IDS. ML algorithms bring their distinctive capability to absorb from previous data and adapt to emerging patterns, presenting a dynamic and efficient avenue for identifying both familiar and unfamiliar threats. ML‐empowered IDS can effectively process massive datasets, uncover subtle irregularities, and analyze previously unseen attack patterns, thereby involving precision and speed in detecting security breaches [3]. The adaptability of ML‐driven IDS equips them to address the complexities introduced by a wide range of cyberattacks, as they autonomously refine and evolve their detection strategies in response to ever‐evolving threat landscapes.
In this context, this research embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the performance analysis of numerous ML procedures in IDSs. The study delves into the evaluation of some popular ML algorithms, including Random Forest, k‐Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and Density‐Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). A meticulous examination of these algorithms encompasses their accuracy, precision, recall, and adaptability across different feature subsets. Employing the Jupyter Notebook software for coding implementations, the proposed approach combines supervised and unsupervised techniques, leveraging the strengths of each to gain deeper insights into the performance analysis of IDSs. By shedding light on the behavior and efficiency of these advanced techniques, this research contributes to the advancement of cybersecurity by informing the development of more effective and reliable defense mechanisms against a diverse array of threats.


8.2 Literature Survey
Various studies have been done on the performance analysis of IDS using ML procedures. Work is being done on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of these systems, which play a significant part in safekeeping computer networks and systems from evolving cyber threats. In a detailed study by Zhang et al. [1], an approach for intrusion detection was proposed, using a hybrid model that combines ML algorithms to improve detection rates. The study accentuates the effectiveness of various techniques in enhancing IDS performance. In the work of Jain et al. [2], a detailed study was conducted on the application of ML techniques to IDSs. The researchers investigated the performance of kNN, SVM, and Random Forest algorithms on large datasets. Their findings depicted the significance of feature selection and algorithm choice in achieving optimal IDS outcomes. Further research by Kumar et al. [3] delved into the study of the NSL‐KDD (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) dataset using numerous ML techniques. The study matched the performance of decision tree‐based classifiers, SVM, and kNN algorithms. The authors emphasized the role of feature selection and preprocessing in influencing the accuracy and efficiency of IDS. An exploration of intrusion detection through ML techniques was presented by Nain et al. [4], where the authors evaluated the performance of several algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM, on real‐world network datasets. The study focused on the potential of ML in differentiating between normal and anomalous network activities. The work of Bhatt and Trivedi [5] focused on enhancing the performance of IDS using deep learning (DL) approaches. The researchers used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for intrusion detection, achieving likely results in accurately identifying network intrusions. Building upon these investigations, Sharma and Gupta [6] conducted a study on enhancing IDSs using ML techniques. The authors highlighted the role of feature engineering and algorithm selection in achieving robust IDS performance.
These studies collectively emphasize the significance of feature selection, algorithm choice, and hybrid approaches in effectively detecting and mitigating cybersecurity threats.


8.3 ML Techniques
One of the main aims of ML is to build systems that can inevitably learn patterns and insights from data, allowing computers to make predictions, classifications, decisions, or perform tasks without being explicitly programmed for each specific instance [7]. It consists of a wide range of methods, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and more, which are applied across many domains like natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, recommendation systems, and many more. Some of the algorithms used in the paper are explained as follows.

8.3.1 Random Forest
This technique is a popular method that comes under supervised learning. One of its biggest strengths is its ability to manage complex datasets thus it is a very important method for many predictive tasks in Machine Learning. It is based on the concept of a forest consisting of multiple trees, the more the number of trees, the more robust the forest. It employs the principle of ensemble learning by joining multiple classifiers to address complex problems and improve model performance. By combining various decision trees, it is able to achieve precise predictions. Each tree is trained on a subset of the data, and the final prediction is determined through a majority vote or averaging [8]. It is used for classification which contains continuous variables and regression tasks consisting of categorical variables and handles overfitting as well. It also captures complex relationships within data and is resilient to noisy features. The following Figure 8.1 summarizes the working of this algorithm.

8.3.2 Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting is an additional form of ensemble technique that builds a predictive model through the combination of feeble predictive models like decision trees. This approach diminishes errors inherited from preceding models by concentrating on rectifying the inaccuracies they generated, thereby enhancing the precision [9]. It is a versatile technique widely used for various tasks, offering high accuracy, and robustness against overfitting as shown in Figure 8.
