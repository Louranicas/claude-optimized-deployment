Chapter: 2019 - Additionally, the Ponemon Institute reports a 67% increase in cybercrimes in the last five years alone, with the banking industry being the most affected. Cybercrimes cost the banking sector $18 million in 2018 alone. The study of cybersecurity is vital for businesses since the failure to understand the dangers of cybercrimes may lead to the exposure and theft of customers’ information.
Another consequence of failing to prevent cybercrimes is reputation loss. Surveys conducted by cybersecurity experts in 2017 found that stakeholders view cybersecurity breaches as one of the biggest reputational threats, just below poor customer service, poor quality of products, and service. As a result, businesses that fall victim to cybersecurity breaches will find themselves in a perpetuating cycle of loss from the costs incurred to alleviate the issue and losing their customers’ trust, creating an even more significant financial loss.
Whereas it is difficult for businesses to maintain a protection100% rate, strategic efforts can immensely reduce the levels of cyberattacks. In addition to businesses, the public should be aware of preventative measures such as setting up secure passwords and not sharing them with anyone and keeping operating systems, browsers, antivirus, and other critical software up to date. Other preventative measures for the public are verifying the authenticity of requests from companies or individuals by paying close attention to website URLs. In addition, being suspicious and alert about unknown links or requests sent through email or text messages can block hackers’ chances of stealing valuable information.
Cybersecurity Risks and Threats
Internet scams and cybercrimes will continue to present serious threats to business operations for the foreseeable future. Businesses will suffer tremendous losses as a result of internet scams and cybercrimes. In general, an attack on business enterprises is an attack on customers. Businesses store large databases of the personal information of their customers. Cybercriminals know organizations have a storehouse of valuable information they could illegally access for financial gains. Cyber break-ins will certainly expose customers. Organizations have a responsibility to protect their consumers from cyberthreats. It is incumbent on business leaders to implement security measures to combat internet scams and cyberattacks on their customers. It is best practice for business leaders to factor cyber protective measures in their strategic management decisions. The integration of computers with their vast network systems, software, physical hardware components, and a wide array of computational systems that manage business services is called cyber-physical systems (CPS). Researchers contended that while CPS provides benefits that allow businesses to grow and expand, they also have vulnerabilities that internet scammers and cybercriminals can exploit. Therefore, the most effective way to mitigate these risks and vulnerabilities is to establish strategic combat systems to prevent potential risks and construct an effective risk management framework. The implementation of security measures should begin at the first stage of business operations. Cybersecurity should be a part of the primary strategic management decisions.
E-Commerce and Cybersecurity
The transition from offline to an online business operation requires strategic cybersecurity planning. The decision to venture into e-commerce and online transactions present new threats to the business organization. Thus, it is prudent that management implement safety measures to protect their assets. Designing the service with security measures from the beginning will help eliminate or illuminate gaps in their CPS that can be exploited. However, CPS is complex and convoluted. Management should establish protocols during the initial stage to handle potential security breaches that may occur. Hence, assigning knowledgeable personnel and equipping them with adequate resources to manage potential security threats is essential. In addition, a robust system must be in place to manage the supply chain. Many breaches occur directly through the supply chain gaps. Therefore, business leaders must be aware of the potential danger that exists within the supply chain. The lack of adequate security protocols among users within the interconnectivity field could jeopardize the supply chain. Cybercriminals may find access to the manufacturers, suppliers, or customers that could disrupt the whole supply chain. Scheduling regular maintenance and services help keep computer networks safe and reliable. Thus, cybersecurity personnel should monitor the CPS infrastructure to ensure the optimum operational ability. Maintenance is a crucial tool against cybercriminals. Quick adaptation to new technologies and preventative measures implemented can help businesses achieve a high level of security and success.
Forecasting Cybersecurity Threats
Cybersecurity forecasting is a technique that uses historical data on cybercrimes to predict future attacks. Cybersecurity forecasts cannot predict with 100% accuracy when a cyberattack will occur; however, the information generated may play an integral role in developing protection policies and implementation strategies. Knowing cyberattack strategies enable information system administrators to establish formidable combat strategies to protect their organizations. Forecast data may be useful in helping organizations design short-term, medium-term, and long-term strategies when preparing their systems to combat cyberattacks.
When gathering data for forecasting, researchers use two conventional scientific approaches: primarily qualitative and quantitative approaches. Researchers use the quantitative approach because it allows the use of a time-series model that uses the data over time in the past to predict the future. In this method, the longer time span of historical data gathering may produce a greater abundance of information that will provide greater prediction accuracy. Within the context of cybersecurity, the Ponemon Institute found that between 2017 and 2018, an increase in security breaches occurred by 11% (2019). Using this data spanning one year alone does not provide enough information to determine whether the next year will have an increase or decrease in cyberattacks. However, conducting further research, organizations may find that over the last five years, there has been a 67% increase in cyberattacks (Ponemon 2019). Given the upward trend of cybersecurity threats, there is a strong prediction that there may be an increase in cyberattacks.
Using the qualitative approach, cybersecurity administrators can use observation, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, and executive opinions to gather valuable data and make reasonable predictions. The qualitative method helps cyber administrators form groups of qualified experts to analyze data and build a robust system for future cyberdefense. Cybersecurity experts can help identify how breaches occurred in the past and predict new, innovative ways to manage these crimes in the future. After gathering the data, security managers can make an accurate forecast and determine the operations strategy they should use to combat cyberattacks.
Fraud Detection System
The emergence of sophisticated, advanced technologies has resulted in the developing and applying cutting-edge fraud detection systems. The security challenges faced by cybersecurity administrators is that cybercriminals have access to this resource as well. Thus, these innovative fraud detection systems that have been developed to protect consumers are being used by cybercriminals in the continuous growth of fraudulent activities. Legitimate users employ these systems via electronic commerce systems to manage banking systems, credit card systems, telecommunication systems, and healthcare insurance systems. Cybercriminals take advantage of these cyber-detection systems through their insider networks, workplace access, and hacking skills. Hence, cybercriminals can use different strategies to obtain access in the electronic commerce systems illegally. The collaboration of fraud prevention and detection systems may have a better chance of combatting internet scams and secure electronic commerce systems.
Online users should be aware that it is necessary to implement fraud scam detection systems to secure their data. Internet users should not wait until a breach to implement robust security systems. In the growing development of cybercriminal defense systems, a fraud detection system is considered the next layer of protection. Fraud detection systems are designed to discover and identify fraudulent activities entering personal and organizational networks and report attempted intrusions to cybersystem administrators. Thus, put legitimate users on guard and give them the ability to adapt new secure measures to thwart potential breaches.
Fraud Prevention
Online users should be aware that fraud prevention systems are considered the first line of defense to protect and secure their networks against fraudulent activities. The purpose of this phase is to prevent data breaches. Implementing these mechanisms in the early stage restricts, suppresses, disrupts, destroys, controls, removes, or prevents the occurrence of cyberattacks in computer network systems (hardware and software systems). Examples of such mechanisms include using encryption algorithms applied to scramble data. Another mechanism is a firewall that forms a blockade between the internal privately owned and external networks. Cybercrime awareness is one of the ways that online users may prevent online scams. The Better Business Bureau platform can be used to verify the authenticity of sellers; thus, creating more secure online transactions. Also, online users should look for unfamiliar activities such as emails, weblinks, and phone numbers on incoming calls. Second, pay the safest way by using credit cards for online purchases. Credit cards allow online users to review purchases, verify charges, and detect fraudulent charges. Unauthorized charges on customers’ accounts may be disputed and an investigation established.
Intrusion Detection System
Due to the growing internet and increased availability of high-frequency systems, intrusion detection has become a critical part of information security. As a result, the need to secure computer networks have increased remarkably. Intrusion detection was introduced by James P. Anderson in the 1980s and has been an effective tool against cybercrimes. Intrusion detection systems allow analysts to focus on past occurrences and the effectiveness of the intrusion detection system to develop a better understanding of how to deal with present situations.
The Need for Intrusion Detection Systems
Organizations and consumers cannot always protect themselves against internet hackers and scammers from intrusions. However, they can acquire and install devices and applications to their networks that detect intrusions and prevent attackers from stealing valuable information. Internet users’ information security is comprehensively enabled by intrusion detection systems (IDS) comprising a set of integrated software and hardware blended into the internet users’ information and data policies as well as practices concerning security. When a system is deployed on the internet, it is vulnerable to various attacks, and the system needs to be protected against multiple cyberattackers. Any activity compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a computer network resource is termed intrusion. Intrusions are generally placed at input and output points of the network to detect irregular traffic. In addition, this system provides logging functionality and alerts about attacks from scammers.
The tremendous escalation of computer networks, the internet, telecommunication, digital devices, and online transactions has created a higher risk of intrusions. The efforts to protect online users’ information from hackers and intruders have become increasingly complex. Technology researchers have developed data mining and machine-learning techniques for detecting the intrusions of cybercriminals. However, security solutions like firewalls are not designed to handle network or application layer attacks such as DoS, DDoS, Worms, Viruses, and Trojans. The primary purpose of an intrusion detection system is to collect, gather, and analyze information from various areas within a computer or a network system to identify possible security breaches.
Cybersecurity Management Threats by Type Viruses
Computer viruses were developed and designed to reproduce themselves by attaching to legitimate computer programs with the intent to corrupt the programs that they attach to. Unfortunately, cybercriminals have developed and expanded their efforts in creating more effective computer viruses that are difficult to detect. These viruses infiltrate computer networks through email links and web browsing. They can replicate themselves and spread quickly through computer networks with crippling effects. Once a virus has successfully attached to a computer program, file, or document, the virus will lie dormant until an opportunity arises for the computer or device to give its code and give the virus full access and control of the network. For a virus to infect a computer, it needs to have the ability to add and run the computer system to infect the program, which, in turn, causes the virus code to carry out its intended purpose.
Trojan Downloaders
One of the most common and enduring viruses is the Trojan Horse malware. These viruses are still being distributed through unsolicited emails. There are approximately 17 types of Trojans, some of which are listed below:

Trojan Downloaders
One of the most common and enduring viruses is the Trojan Horse malware. These viruses are still being distributed through unsolicited emails. There are approximately 17 types of Trojans, some of which are listed below:

Backdoor Trojan
Distributed denial of service attack Trojan
Downloader
Game thief
Fake AV
Info stealer
Mail finder
Ransom
Remote access
Rootkit
SMS
Trojan banker
Trojan IM

This network of viruses is popular among hackers because they are cheap and can be easily distributed. This malware could take remote control of a computer or network once the computer system is infected. Additionally, cybercriminals use this virus as a tool to illegally transfer money to overseas accounts once they gain access to banking information from account customers. One of the ways cybercriminals use Trojan Horses is by sending emails that resemble the email of a known and trusted correspondent. The unsuspecting recipient opens the email and attachment as legitimate correspondence and unknowingly gives access to the Trojan malware. These illegitimate emails are sent from cybercriminals who intend to install malware on individual and organizational devices where the malware can spread to other files and damage computer systems.
Worms
Worms are malicious programs that are self-replicating on computers and computer networks without the users’ knowledge. These malicious programs can spread through networks, remote connections, and self-replications. Generally, worms are transmitted due to software weaknesses. Worms travel to their destination primarily through attachments in spam emails and instant messages. Worms are designed to infiltrate computer systems once the computer user opens these files. Then the malware automatically downloads onto the computer system. In addition, worms infiltrate computer systems through weblinks from malicious websites. Worms are used to destroy software. Also, cybercriminals use worms as a distraction to gain access to organizations’ databases and wipe them clean after they steal data. Sometimes, the purpose of a computer worm is to replicate itself and deplete organizational resources, such as hard drive space. In addition, worms also steal data, install backdoors, and allow a hacker to gain control over the computer network and system settings.
How to Protect Your Data from Cyberthreats
Cyberthreats involve data breaches. These threats happen primarily using electronic devices such as computer tablets and smartphones. Cybercriminals can find access to individual and organizational data through a vulnerability in networks and firewall systems that allow malware to penetrate and compromise computer network apparatuses. Also, cybercriminals use phishing scams to induce employees to click on emails and corrupt links that unwittingly provide critical personal data to cybercriminals.
Cybersecurity administrators have been vigilant in setting up network security systems to protect customers’ data and key operating systems. Typically, a network security system relies on layers of protection and consists of multiple components, such as network monitors, security software, and computer hardware components. The coordination of comprehensive network components is designed to work together harmoniously to ensure the increase of overall network security. Adaptive security in computer networks is a relatively new approach that has been gaining the interest of computer security managers. Network security requires specific security protocols to guide a safe process. Protocols may include authentication, access control, data confidentiality, data integrity, and data management. Adaptive network security refers to a network system that is designed with the ability to analyze system behaviors and adapt to threats before they occur. This technological innovation allows network systems to allocate resources and adapt to unpredictable changes while hiding the intrinsic complexity from operators, users, and network components.
Seniors’ Protection and Authentications
Protecting the personal data of senior citizens has become a daunting task. Researchers have found that seniors over 60 are more likely to become victims of phishing and internet scams due to their unawareness of cybertactics. In addition, cybercriminals are aware that seniors are less likely to recognize the syntaxes, symbols, spellings, and grammatical errors in emails that should alert the user of cyber-phishing strategies.
Seniors with strong brand loyalty may not recognize when cybercriminals use counterfeits of their trusted brands to steal their identities. Also, it has been determined that people are aware of phishing and scams but neglect to take sufficient precautions. Many victims might have found errors in their emails but did not exercise enough vigilance, which led to internet scams.
According to technical literature, the impact of online fraud has been growing steadily over the past 20 years. Victims of internet scams are harmed both emotionally and financially. Research has shown that internet scams cause emotional distress for some victims and their loved ones. In addition, some people had financial crises due to online scams.
Detecting and Preventing Internet Phishing
Cyber researchers have discussed different ways that scammers use to phish people. So they have designed strategic steps that users may use as precautionary measures to prevent phishing attacks. The first step is to install good antiphishing software and continually update antivirus, firewall, antispam filters, and other domain-name-specific password management tools. Next, users may minimize the chance of becoming phishing victims by following security protocols. Even though scammers have found many ways to trap people, measures can be taken to prevent being scammed.
The increased use of credit cards in offline and online activities is highly used in today’s modern business transactions. Credit cards are beneficial for fast payments. It ensures that the purchaser will pay for services and goods being purchased. However, as there is a high usage of credit cards, there are increased opportunities for fraud related to credit card activities. Cybersecurity researchers have found that genetic algorithms can eliminate credit card fraud. The genetic algorithms technique is one of the ways to set up a secure payment system for credit cards and protect credit card information from cybercriminals.
Cybersecurity experts have examined different steps that could be taken to help ensure phishing-proof internet use. One of the steps involves emailing information directly to the intended recipient only instead of multi-sharing. Another step involves limiting information exposure; phishing can be prevented if the attacker does not have sufficient information to formulate a strategy that could modify the target user’s account. Unfortunately, Internet phishers have found many ways to undermine network systems on the World Wide Web. However, if internet users follow cybersecurity guidelines, cyber fraud can be prevented.
This chapter has examined hackers’ techniques, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), intrusion detection systems (IDS), governments cyberattack involvements, users’ protocols, and protective procedures for safe internet practices.
Foreign Government Cyberattacks
The suspected Chinese government’s cyberattack on the Marriott Hotel chain in 2018 is one of modern technological history’s most significant data breaches. Sophisticated hackers used remote systems to access Marriott’s computer network and installed a remote access Trojan (RAT). This cybercriminal technique is a type of malware that provides the attacker complete remote control over the target’s computer network system.
Scope of the Cybersecurity Breach 
Marriott’s management reported the scope and impact of the data breach as follows:

383 million of the hotel’s guest records were exposed
18.5 million encrypted passport numbers were compromised
5.25 million unencrypted passport numbers, of which approximately 663,000 were United States travelers, were compromised
9.1 million encrypted payment card numbers were adversely affected
$3 million in net expenses for cybersecurity-related costs

The Marriott Company could have avoided exposing private personal data to the Chinese intelligence agencies if the company’s management did not use customer data to conduct commercial activities. Instead, sophisticated Chinese hackers from the intelligence services invaded Marriott’s database and compromised the hotel chain’s guests’ privacy. The United States (US) government cannot intervene in foreign governments’ data breaches because the US government also practices clandestine surveillance.
Cybersecurity Cost to Internet Users
Cybersecurity costs to internet users are staggering. In 2020, global losses from cybercrimes increased to approximately $1 trillion. More than 2 billion records were compromised, and the trend is growing as online transactions increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Target Corporation chain store’s reputation was compromised severely in 2013, which resulted in the loss of profits due to a cybersecurity breach. Target was ordered to pay $18.5 million for the data breach that impacted 41 million customers. Cybersecurity breaches have induced organizations to increase their security investments drastically. Organizations are making significant cybersecurity investments and designing strategies to create a safer online environment for their internet users.
Small companies with less than 500 employees, which typically earn $50 million or less in annual revenue, have experienced losses of more than $2.5 million on average. Cybercriminals’ invasion of proprietary information has plagued large and small organizations for the past four decades. This threat has heightened over the years as cybercriminals have become more knowledgeable on ways to maneuver preventative measures implemented by business technology leaders. As a result, the leaders of large and small organizations are faced with an immense responsibility as even the slightest breach could tarnish the company’s reputation and compromise the security of their customers’ information.
Internet scams continue to grow as global society heavily relies on technological systems. Cybercrime activities, such as identity theft, phishing, vishing, denial of service, malware, hacking, social engineering, automated online banking fraud, and ransomware are becoming technically advanced every day. Hackers use these systems to hold big data hostage and force organizations to pay millions of dollars. Even countries with extensive computer network systems, namely North America, Europe, and Asia, are prime targets for cybercriminal activities. North America leads the world in cyberattacks on organizational networks with a staggering 36% of the reported cases. Internet scammers have also shown a preference for attacking Windows-based systems. NetBIOS is an acronym for a basic network input and output system. NetBIOS allows applications on separate computer systems to communicate. The NetBIOS probe is a popular communication system; however, critical security issues are due to vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system that increase the security costs for organizations.
In this text, we analyzed surveys conducted by researchers regarding the reputational effects of cybercrimes on organizations’ reputations. The data show that stakeholders view cybersecurity breaches as a significant reputational threat. Furthermore, an analysis of the data revealed that short-term cybercrimes impact the business’s functionality and operations. However, in the long term, cyberbreaches have a lasting effect on organizations’ reputations. Unfortunately, many senior managers are still oblivious to the long-term financial impact of cyberbreaches.
