11.2.4.1 Government Cyber RangesRegarding government-supported cyber ranges, we note first that their main focus is either general education and training, sometimes restricted to educational institutions within the same geographic area (e.g., Arkansas Cyber Range), or military training (e.g., National Cyber Range).In general, these cyber ranges provide a wide variety of training modules and offer industry-recognized certifications, sometimes even supporting skill frameworks such as the NICE Framework (e.g., Michigan Cyber Range). Some organizations reuse hardware and software components in their cyber ranges in order to make it possible to conduct training for different purposes (e.g., CR14 and National Cyber Range). Moreover, some cyber ranges may even have advanced training capabilities, such as support for user emulation and traffic generation (e.g., CRATE).It is important to note that the organizations that make available cyber ranges from this category usually provide few details about the technologies used to construct them. One reason could be that many of these cyber ranges are built using technologies provided by private-sector companies, even if the names of those companies are not always disclosed. Two exceptions in this regard are AIT Cyber Range and CRATE, for which several academic publications are available that present technical information about their architecture and capabilities. This is due to the fact that these systems are developed in-house by the research institutes that operate them.A consequence of the use of proprietary technologies, either from private-sector companies or developed in-house, is that the source code of the cyber range platforms is not made publicly available. This is the case even when the platform is developed by the organization managing the cyber range itself, such as for the AIT Cyber Range and CRATE mentioned above, and also for CR14, presumably due to the military nature of the training conducted on them.We observe that some of the government cyber ranges also provide support for specialized cybersecurity training, mostly in relation with ICS and SCADA technologies. For some of these systems, critical infrastructure domains are also covered, such as the power grid or the railroad system.
11.2.4.2 Private-Sector Cyber RangesThe cyber ranges in the private-sector category are the most numerous, given the commercial incentive of providing training for profit. However, we noticed a certain level of churn in this category, with some cyber ranges we were familiar with not being advertised anymore, such as the Raytheon Cyber Range, or the Boeing Cyber Range. We can imagine that some of those technologies have been integrated in other solutions of their corresponding companies, but it can also be assumed that market conditions have eliminated some of the more expensive solutions, as new competitors entered the marketplace.Most private-sector cyber ranges provide a large training catalog—that of Cyberbit Cyber Range being one of the largest—with detailed exercise filtering being available in some cases (e.g., ATCorp CYRIN). The forms of training are diverse, ranging from several-hour tournaments to three-day training programs, and even months long continuous training. Moreover, many training programs include support for the NICE Framework; this demonstrates that leveraging the association of work roles, tasks, knowledge, and skills, as defined in various workforce and skill frameworks, is an important aspect of cybersecurity training (see Sect. 3.​2 for a more detailed discussion of this issue).In terms of distinctive features, several of the cyber ranges we presented (e.g., Cyberbit Cyber Range) provide automated trainee progress assessment capabilities, which makes it easier to quantify the exact skill level a participant has attained.Creating a training environment as realistic as possible is also important for many companies, and most of them accomplish this by using realistic network topologies. However, emulating real internet like services, as well as human actor actions and traffic generation are also important capabilities in this respect, as provided by the JYVSECTEC Cyber Range. Another standout in this regard is the Keysight Cyber Range, which can use the optional BreakingPoint traffic generator to reproduce over 490 application protocols and 60,000 cyberattacks and malware threats.We note that IBM X-Force Cyber Range includes a distinctive feature that is not often encountered for cybersecurity training platforms, which mainly focus on technical training. Thus, the exercises available on this cyber range are designed in such as manner as to make it possible for personnel with non-technical roles, such as legal and risk management leaders, finance department personnel, or human resource leaders to work together with the IT teams during the exercise. This contributes both to an increased security awareness of the non-technical personnel and also to an improvement in the incident response capabilities of the organization as a whole. The crisis simulation platforms from Cyberbit and Immersive Labs play a similar function, although they do not appear to integrate an actual technical training aspect, as it is done in IBM X-Force Cyber Range.Another important remark is that, as expected, private-sector cyber ranges do not provide any source code for their platforms. Moreover, the details made available focus predominantly on the end-user experience and features and rarely on the technologies used to implement those capabilities. In fact, in some cases the amount of information provided was so low that we decided to exclude certain cyber ranges from our analysis; this was the case for the GLESEC Cyber Range,1 for which only a very simple overview of the available services is made public.However, the JYVSECTEC Cyber Range is an exception in this respect, since even though its source code is not public, several scientific publications related to its capabilities and the underlying concepts are available, such as [28]. The reason for this is that JYVSECTEC is a university spin-off company, and cyber range development is still conducted as part of a research institute.Several of the private-sector cyber ranges also include specialized cybersecurity training capabilities regarding ICS and SCADA technologies. In addition, some of them cover also the power grid, oil and gas plants, and even the healthcare domain.
11.2.4.3 Academia Cyber RangesThe cyber ranges we included in the academia cyber range category are those developed primarily in an academic research environment; hence, the focus in this case is both research and education. As the surveys we mentioned in Sect. 11.1.2 indicate, there are many such cyber ranges that have been implemented over the years. However, their development often finishes when the corresponding research projects end. Therefore, we have focused here on two cyber ranges that have been developed for a decade or more and are still in active use, namely CyTrONE and KYPO CRP. We note that the scope of KYPO CRP training activities is the largest of the two, ranging from education to military training.The most important characteristic of the two cyber ranges we presented is that the source code needed to deploy them is publicly available. This means that interested organizations can utilize them on their own premises as well and also modify the source code to extend their functionality as needed. Therefore, the names of these two cyber ranges refer not only to the actual cyber range deployment, but also to the corresponding cyber range platform software that can be used by anyone.One distinguishing feature of CyTrONE is that the components used in its modular architecture can also operate in a standalone manner, which increases their applicability and overall flexibility. As for KYPO CRP, it has several training facilitation features, such as trainee activity monitoring and learning data exploration capabilities, as well as support for both formative and summative assessments.A point of similarity for the two platforms is that the training content and environment definition is done by means of human and machine-readable representation formats, such as YAML and JSON. This allows instructors to directly analyze and update the definitions if needed.


11.3 Specialized Cyber RangesSpecialized cyber ranges are those training platforms that cover other technologies than those associated with regular computer networks. Although there can be many such technologies, in what follows, we will cover the following types of specialized cyber ranges that we consider the most significant, and for which we will provide a series of representative examples shown in alphabetical order:Internet of Things (IoT) cyber ranges.Industrial Control System (ICS) cyber ranges.Critical infrastructure cyber ranges.Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and healthcare cyber ranges.
11.3.1 IoT Cyber RangesIoT cyber ranges make it possible to conduct cybersecurity training related to IoT devices and networks, often by using simulation and emulation techniques to create training environments that reproduce those systems’ characteristics.11.3.1.1 IoT-CRIoT Cyber Range (IoT-CR) is an IoT testbed intended for research and training related to IoT security [39]. The training environment is represented by a customizable IoT network, made of both virtual and physical devices, and supports the concurrent execution of multiple scenarios.Although the IoT-CR cyber range is said to include twenty RE-MOTE IoT devices developed by Zolertia,2 most of the discussion in the cited paper refers to the use of virtual devices for improved scalability and flexibility. For this purpose, IoT-CR leverages the Cooja IoT network simulator, which is run in headless mode, and delivers to participants the simulation results.The scenario that is discussed consists of a realistic network topology, IoT device configuration, and IoT applications developed in Contiki-NG. The use of IoT-CR was demonstrated via a red team versus blue team simulation scenario involving a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack variant for IoT devices.
11.3.1.2 IoTrain-LabIoTrain-Lab is an IoT security training platform that uses the FIT IoT-LAB testbed as training infrastructure [14, 57]. The cyber range is composed of the real IoT devices in the testbed and can be used by trainees to conduct hands-on training activities in a controlled environment. The training content of IoTrain-Lab focuses on fundamental IoT training exercises, but IoT security training is included as well. Since IoTrain-Lab was already described in detail in Sect. 7.​3.​2, readers should consult that section for more information.
11.3.1.3 IoTrain-SimIoTrain-Sim is a companion training system for IoTrain-Lab. However, different from IoTrain-Lab, IoTrain-Sim relies on simulation techniques and leverages the Cooja IoT network simulator to enable a wide variety of training exercises [15, 55]. The training content of IoTrain-Sim includes both fundamental IoT training exercises and security training ones. For the security training exercises, the focus is on attacks specific to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), such as resource attacks, topology attacks, and traffic attacks. IoTrain-Sim was previously introduced in Sect. 7.​3.​1, which should be referred to for more details.
11.3.1.4 LeafLeaf is a cybersecurity training platform intended for realistic IoT training exercises, with focus on edge IoT scenarios [19]. The term edge IoT refers to the convergence of IoT technologies with edge computing, that is processing and analyzing data on the edge of the network, closer to the IoT devices, instead of performing it in the cloud. Thus, Leaf is intended as a solution for organizing training exercises for various edge IoT application domains, as well as an experiment platform for validating solutions for the prevention, detection, mitigation, and recovery from edge IoT specific cyberattacks.Leaf has two main components, a training support application and the cyber range. The training support application is a web application implemented in PHP that relies on the Zend Framework, which is an open-source web application framework, and CoreUI, which is an open-source UI library and administration panel template that supports the development of responsive web applications.The cyber range in Leaf is designed in an agnostic manner with respect to the actual implementation technologies. This makes it possible to represent heterogeneous IoT assets by relying on simulation and virtualization techniques to support a variety of scenario components and network topologies. In particular, the IoT nodes and the wireless connections between them are simulated using event-based simulators, such as OMNET++ and Ns-
