Investigation preparation
This phase involves recognizing the investigation’s objective and determining the necessary resources for its execution. The investigator needs to understand the purpose and the goal of the particular case investigation. They need to prepare the essential resources that would be required to facilitate the investigation.

Evidence acquisition
This step requires identifying the sources of the digital evidence and looking for methods to preserve the digital evidence. This step is extremely crucial, collecting evidence from different possible sources. A single wrong step could lead to the loss of highly important information. The investigator needs to make sure to search areas that are easily missed for hidden data or information. Collecting data or evidence is surely important but thinking and implementing methods to preserve these collected data is equally important.
Analysis of evidence
In this stage, it is necessary to pinpoint the potential tools and methods that could be applied for data processing and the interpretation of analytical outcomes. Analyzing the evidence collected, its relevance in regards to the case, and checking how it can be used to get closer to the result.
Result determination
This step requires making or compiling your findings into a report and then presenting those findings. Compiling all the evidence collected along with your conclusion based on your findings.



3.4 Demystifying Artificial Intelligence in the Digital World
AI constitutes a domain within computer science wherein computer systems are enabled to replicate human intelligence. This discipline encompasses the investigation and construction of computer systems capable of emulating certain human‐like forms of intelligence. It encompasses the realm of systems that possess the ability to grasp novel concepts, engage in logical reasoning, formulate deductions, comprehend natural language, and interpret visual scenes.
AI can be categorized into different types based on its capabilities and functionalities.

3.4.1 Artificial Narrow Intelligence
This type of AI is focused on a specific task with specific intelligence [8]. The form of AI referred to as Narrow AI is readily observable in contemporary computing environments. These intelligent systems have acquired the capability to execute specific tasks without direct, explicit programming. This manifestation of intelligence is exemplified by technologies such as voice recognition in Apple’s iPhone assistant Siri, the visual recognition system within self‐driving cars, and even product recommendation engines. Unlike human cognitive abilities, these systems are confined to mastering and performing designated tasks, hence earning the label of “narrow” AI.


3.4.2 Artificial General Intelligence
This type of AI can perform anything a human is capable of performing. Diverging significantly, General AI embodies a form of adaptive cognition akin to the flexibility seen in human intelligence. It possesses the capacity to learn and proficiently execute a broad spectrum of tasks, ranging from basic activities like hair cutting to complex undertakings such as problem‐solving across diverse domains. This ability to engage with various subjects stems from accumulated experiential learning (Figure 3.2).


Figure 3.2 Types of artificial intelligence.




3.4.3 Artificial Super Intelligence
These are the AI systems that can outshine human intelligence in every aspect. These are self‐learning systems that outshine human intelligence in problem‐solving, creativity, and planning. These systems have capabilities to learn itself.
AI is a technique based on algorithms and models and is one of the biggest reasons for the rise in technology and business fields. The AI revelations come with a couple of advantages [9].

AI provides great reliability.
Its cost‐effectiveness is a real help for companies and businesses.
It is capable of solving complicated or complex issues and problems.


Table 3.1 The benefits of AI in forensics.




Benefits of incorporating AI into Digital Forensics 

Decrease in personnel hours and reduction of involvement schedules.
AI systems have the capacity to efficiently handle and analyze considerably larger volumes of data in a notably shorter timeframe. As a consequence, the allocation of personnel hours for engagements is decreased, yielding savings for both accounting firms and audited organizations. Furthermore, AI can expedite the process of pinpointing the root cause of fraud, a particularly valuable advantage in cases where fraudulent activities are still ongoing. 

Technology related to machine learning and the processing of natural language.
Through the integration of natural language processing technology, AI identifies key attributes and performance indicators in contracts, administrative records, financial statements, and similar documents. Furthermore, AI platforms, operating as machine‐learning solutions, provide organizations the flexibility to adapt the systems to their unique requirements using sample documents. These systems continue to enhance their capabilities through usage, without the need for explicit programming [10]. 

Elimination of human mistakes.
Due to its minimal requirement for human involvement in data processing and analysis, AI substantially diminishes the likelihood of human error stemming from clerical mistakes, typos in equations or figures, and similar issues. Additionally, AI plays a pivotal role in detecting irregularities or incongruities within data sets, aiding in the recognition of human‐made errors. 

Enhanced data interpretation.
As AI possesses the capability to handle substantial data volumes, the platforms can condense information into user‐friendly visuals for presenting findings. This facilitates precise, prompt, and comprehensible data analysis.   

It is capable of providing helpful options and is useful in decision‐making.
AI also makes sure to restrict data from getting lost.
AI has reinforcement learning which is one of the greatest tools in trying to increase the reliability of applications. It is based on testing in real life the success and failure of applications.
Table 3.1 discusses the benefits of incorporating AI into Digital Forensics.




3.5 Application of Machine Learning in Digital Forensics Investigations
Digital forensics analysts can largely make use or take advantage of machine learning algorithms and models to detect and uncover easily missed (when conducted manually) and hidden evidence in digital sources [11]. Machine learning pattern detection and recognition can be used or applied to carry these forensic investigations out. Regardless of the many works or methods proposed to apply machine learning to digital forensics, there are numerous skepticisms regarding the opacity of AI in digital forensics (Figure 3.3).
The goal of AIML in computer forensics is to be able to analyze and then correlate the data or information stored as evidence in an investigation [12]. It is used to reduce the large amounts of data collected to only required and interesting evidence related to the investigation, in this way data or evidence to be personally analyzed is reduced.

The correlation functionality serves the purpose of identifying connections among evidence that might be disregarded or not noticed by human professionals, primarily due to the substantial volume of data under consideration [13]. This analytical approach has been empirically validated using authentic datasets, yielding notably favorable, and dependable outcomes in comparison to instances where solely human experts undertook analogous manual analysis.


3.6 Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Forensics
The implementation of AI in the field of forensic or digital security can help different systems analyze the predeterminate approach to handle the errors as well as possible upcoming errors along with possible security breaches and attacks. It can also help us by providing us with different possible approaches that can be taken to predict or analyze the problem, such that the problem is solved before the security of our systems, machines, or applications gets compromised.
When working or analyzing using traditional forensics tools, it is important to get external input from the users to work along with the procedure of the forensic process which is not a need or requirement when using AI tools to analyze forensic data, when using AI tools, it may detect and allocate the threat on the computer system in prior which lets the security program to execute and handle the threat before the breach takes place. However, in case the breach has taken place already, AI can capture the evidence from the source and then maintain a record of the attack to prevent future similar breaches [14].
AI possesses the capability to aid forensic experts by effectively arranging and overseeing data, as well as conducting multi‐tiered meta‐analysis. This contribution can prove time‐saving for forensic investigators during their inquiry processes, thereby safeguarding their dedication to case resolution and elevating the dependability of outcomes to a considerable degree.


3.7 Pattern Recognition Using Artificial Intelligence
AI helps investigators in recognizing patterns which is one of the most important things to find or realize when it comes to forensic investigations. It is important to realize subtle or hard connections to conclude.
Pattern recognition helps in connecting the dots by detecting patterns in emails and messages as well as in the different components of single images. AI is capable of automatically storing previous existing data in databases which makes it easier to match new information with existing information [15]. It assists investigators by making it easier for them to realize if the criminal performing the current breach is possibly someone who has attacked similarly before as well. It would try to fit all the potential data types to obtain a high degree of performance (Figure 3.4).
AI is capable of providing fast and quick solutions to legal communities when it is required in the case of more complex and extensive databases of information.
Miscommunication between important parties involved in a particular forensic investigation could be one of the biggest issues since it would lead to misinterpretation of data, information, or evidence which further would lead to wrong conclusions during the decision‐making process and conclude with injustice. AI helps in bridging the gap between forensic statisticians, lawyers, criminal investigators, and other parties involved in a particular forensic investigation.
Forensic investigations require and involve support from strong statistical evidence to prove your narrative and arguments regarding the particular forensic case. AI is capable of building graphical structures and models situations that will help to prove the reliability of the evidence provided and therefore help the law in approving or disapproving arguments to make better judgements and provide justice. AI also makes it easier to understand the statistics of a study while reducing errors with the help of its mathematical and computational tools.
AI can be a good tool to store, analyze, and use the data stored in its online repositories of all the digital investigations. The exponential rate of development of the storage capacities of USBs, optical media, and hard drives has made it hard for forensic science investigators to store and analyze the data that is in those storage devices [4]. This is where AI comes into play and helps in storing and analyzing all of these large amounts of data.


Figure 3.4 Pattern recognition process.


Data mining is one of the most known fields to use AI. Data mining can aid or facilitate the process of pattern recognition since during data mining, the user can ask for a certain file that contains specific information to be highlighted. It is capable of ignoring obvious patterns or irrelevant patterns focusing on the relevant ones only. It is a combination of statistical and probabilistic AI methods and is used on large or enormously sized data where the normal manual computational methods would prove ineffective and inefficient.
Feature selection and dimensionality reduction help in filtering out relevant, important, quality data from irrelevant, noisy, and redundant data. Both these methods are used in reducing the amount of data, but they are still very different from each other. Feature selection simply selects the most relevant features to increase prediction accuracy while dimensionality reduction fully transforms high‐level features to low‐level features. A few commonly used methods are PCA which is the principal component analysis, information gain, and random projection.
AI helps by providing fraud detection technologies. It helps in combining structured and unstructured data that is collected from various sources to create or form risk models which are extremely crucial and of great importance for advanced analytics. These advanced analytics are utilized to rank risks that are at firm level layer rather than data layer and further approaches like machine learning and cognitive data analytics are used to further the investigations.
Artificial neural networks are capable of telling us the activities of a web surfer. We will be able to distinguish which surfer is surfing legally and which is surfing illegally – making use of proxy servers and accumulating online traffic over a server to crack it down.
Through remote sensing and satellite facilities artificial neural networks are capable of deciding which phone calls to trace and which not during investigations to aid the investigators.


3.8 Applications of AI in Criminal Investigations

3.8.1 Bombing Scenarios
Bombs are extremely hard to deal with and criminals are also capable of destroying hundreds of lives with just a single bomb. However, with the help of AI, we may be able to detect these bombs [16]. Robots, a creation of AI, may be able to detect the various components used in the making of bombs like aluminum powder, nitroglycerine, passive infrared sensors, tetranitrate, etc. This way we may be able to detect explosives beforehand and avoid loss of lives.


3.8.2 Gun Fires
Sensors linked to a cloud‐based program may be placed in municipal infrastructures which will help to correctly identify and pinpoint gunshots. The sensors are capable of recording the time and sound of the gunshots which is information that would help the investigators to pinpoint the location of the shooter or shooters.
Interpretable machine learning classifiers, like decision trees and models based on rules, have frequently found application within digital forensics scenarios. In the realm of elucidating legal cases, the concept of Bayesian Networks (BN) has also garnered attention from the community. AfzaliSeresht and colleagues introduced an approach rooted in explainable AI (XAI), employing event‐based rules to generate narratives for detecting patterns in security event logs. This model serves to support forensic investigators. Furthermore, Mahajan and co‐researchers leveraged Local Interpretable Model‐agnostic Explanations (LIME) for the classification of toxic comments in the realm of cyber forensics. This adoption resulted in not only notable accuracy but also interpretability, surpassing diverse machine learning models.



3.9 Conclusion
This chapter has mentioned the growing rates of criminal attacks in the digital world and how handling these digital attacks manually with limited human labor becomes extensive, unreliable, and extremely hard. Large amounts of data and evidence collected cannot be manually analyzed or handled, and this is the juncture at which the integration of AI becomes pertinent. The utilization of AI simplifies the process for investigators to gather, analyze, and categorize data and evidence. AI technologies like pattern recognition and remote sensing make it easier for investigators to realize the significance of the evidence collected and the correlation between newly collected information and existing information. The forensic sector benefits from AI and considers it a supplementary tool but does not fully depend on it.
