Best Practices for Data Ingestion and Normalization with Splunk
This section delves into the best practices for Splunk data import and standardization. We cover techniques for selecting the correct data inputs and forwarders, how to use the Common Information Model (CIM) to accomplish data standardization, and how to successfully manage data preservation and storage regulations for a streamlined and efficient cybersecurity operation.
Choosing the Right Data Inputs and Forwarders
Choosing the right data inputs and forwarders is critical for accurate and effective data intake in Splunk. Consider the following excellent practices:

Identify essential data sources: Identify the data sources that are most relevant to your security use cases, such as firewall logs, network device logs, application logs, and endpoint logs.
Use Universal Forwarders (UF) for high-performance data forwarding: Universal Forwarders are lightweight and can forward large volumes of data with low resource utilization. Use UFs for the majority of data collection chores.
Use Heavy Forwarders (HF) for data preprocessing: Use Heavy Forwarders if you need to preprocess or filter data before sending it to the indexer. However, keep in mind that HFs utilize more resources than UFs, so use them sparingly.
Monitor files and directories: Set up forwarders to monitor certain files and directories, ensuring that relevant log data is ingested as it is generated.
Assign appropriate sourcetypes to data inputs: Assign an appropriate sourcetype to each data input to ensure accurate parsing, indexing, and searching of the data in Splunk.

Implementing Data Normalization using the Common Information Model (CIM)
In Splunk, data normalization is critical for effective data analysis and correlation. The Common Information Model (CIM) is a standardized data model that aids in the standardization of data. Use the following best practices while deploying CIM:

Use CIM-compatible add-ons and apps: Whenever possible, use CIM-compatible Splunk add-ons and apps to ensure that data from many sources is normalized according to the CIM schema.
Map custom data sources to CIM: If you have bespoke data sources that aren’t supported by existing CIM-compatible add-ons, you’ll need to construct custom field extractions and mapping rules to align the data with the CIM schema.
Validate data mapping: Review and validate your data sources’ mapping to the CIM schema on a regular basis to ensure data normalization is accurate and up to date.

Managing Data Retention and Storage Policies
Proper data retention and storage management are critical for keeping your Splunk implementation efficient and cost-effective. Consider the following best practices:

Establish retention policies based on data value: Create retention policies for various categories of data depending on their value and relevance to your security use cases. Keep crucial data for extended periods of time while deleting less important info more regularly.
Configure index and volume settings: Create distinct indexes and volumes for different sorts of data, each with its own retention settings. This method gives you more control over data preservation and helps you save money on storage.
Track data ingestion rates and storage consumption: Track the volume of data ingested into Splunk as well as the storage usage of your deployment on a regular basis. This will assist you in identifying potential bottlenecks, optimizing resource utilization, and planning for future capacity needs.

You can ensure that your security data is accurate, consistent, and efficiently stored by following these best practices for data intake and normalization with Splunk.
