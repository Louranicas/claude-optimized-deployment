Long Description for Figure 5.4
In centralized placement, a central NIDS monitors traffic from a border router, offering comprehensive visibility and simplified management, but struggling in resource-constrained IoT environments. Distributive placement involves deploying NIDS instances on IoT devices, providing decentralized detection and improved responsiveness with balanced effectiveness. The hybrid placement combines both approaches, with a distributed component for local intrusion detection and a centralized component for overall network visibility.

FIGURE 5.4 Placement of NIDS.

A central NIDS stationed at the border router monitors traffic from IoT devices in a centralized placement setup. Although this method simplifies management and offers extensive traffic visibility, resource limitations in Internet of Things environments present difficulties. By using Distributive Placement, NIDS instances are installed directly on Internet of Things devices. This technique balances the effectiveness of distributed NIDS, ensuring decentralized detection and enhanced responsiveness. By offering local detection capabilities, this configuration addresses the shortcomings of centralized systems. Both distributive and centralized elements are combined in the hybrid placement. It keeps a central NIDS for network visibility overall and employs distributed NIDS for local intrusion detection. By combining the benefits of distributive and centralized techniques, this strategy achieves both localized responsiveness and complete traffic oversight.

5.4.1 Machine Learning and Multi-Access Edge Computing in IDS
The use of ML and MEC to improve IDS for the Internet of Things is covered in detail in this section [5]. By processing data closer to the IoT devices, MEC lowers latency and makes real-time threat detection possible. MEC improves the IDS’s capacity to swiftly assess and address security issues by shifting processing responsibilities from centralized data centers to edge nodes. This is important given the dynamic and resource-constrained nature of IoT environments [5].
The IDS architecture incorporates machine learning approaches to enhance detection precision and adjust to novel and dynamic security threats. To find patterns suggestive of harmful activity, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are some of the machine learning techniques that are used [11]. With the help of these algorithms, the IDS can learn from past data, enhancing its detection capabilities over time and lowering false positives. This IDS framework’s MEC and ML synergy offers a reliable, scalable, and effective solution that is suited to the requirements of contemporary IoT ecosystems and guarantees thorough defense against advanced cyber threats.
The evaluation metrics for IDS performance are determined by the counts of true positives (α), true negatives (δ), false positives (γ), and false negatives (β), as presented in Table 5.
