Security Testing
In the intricate web of global trade and commerce, the supply chain stands as a critical lifeline, connecting businesses, manufacturers, and consumers across continents. However, with the ever-increasing reliance on digital technologies and interconnected systems, this intricate network has become a prime target for malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain or disruptive purposes.
Kaur et al. (2024) argue that as we navigate the complexities of the modern supply chain, it is imperative to recognise the paramount importance of cybersecurity testing. By proactively identifying and mitigating potential risks, we can fortify the resilience of our supply chains, safeguarding not only the flow of goods and services but also the integrity of sensitive data and the trust of our stakeholders.1
Rane and Qureshi (2024) argue that automated scanning and penetration testing are vital components of a cybersecurity strategy. To improve understanding, we must conduct supply chain cybersecurity testing, advocating for best practices in an era where cyber threats loom large. Cybersecurity testing has a pivotal role in securing the supply chain and ensuring partners are not unwittingly opening up new vulnerabilities.2
The growing threat of cyberattacks must be taken seriously. The supply chain, once perceived as a relatively secure domain, has increasingly become a prime target for cybercriminals. The interconnectivity and complexity of modern supply chains, coupled with the proliferation of digital technologies, have inadvertently created vulnerabilities that malicious actors are all too eager to exploit.
Cyberattacks on the supply chain can manifest in various forms, each with devastating consequences. From data breaches compromising sensitive information to ransomware attacks threatening operations, the repercussions can ripple across the entire supply chain ecosystem, disrupting operations, eroding consumer trust, and inflicting substantial financial losses.
Moreover, the rise of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and state-sponsored cyber activities has added a new layer of complexity to the threat landscape. These sophisticated actors possess the resources and motivation to infiltrate supply chains, often with the intent of stealing intellectual property, disrupting critical infrastructure, or gaining a strategic advantage.
Ignoring the growing threat of cyberattacks on the supply chain is no longer an option. Proactive measures, including robust cybersecurity testing, are paramount to safeguarding the integrity and continuity of our supply chains in the face of an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.
Common vulnerabilities in the supply chain must be considered. To effectively secure the supply chain, it is crucial to understand the various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. These vulnerabilities can stem from a range of sources.
Lax security protocols, outdated software, and insufficient access controls can create entry points for cybercriminals to breach systems and compromise data. The supply chain often involves multiple third-party vendors and partners, each with their own security posture. A weak link in this chain can potentially expose the entire ecosystem to cyber threats.
Disgruntled employees, contractors, or individuals with malicious intent can exploit their privileged access to systems and data, posing a significant risk to the supply chain’s integrity. Outdated and legacy systems, which may still be in use due to compatibility or cost concerns, can present vulnerabilities that are difficult to patch or mitigate.
The complex nature of supply chains can create gaps in awareness, making it challenging to monitor and detect potential threats or anomalies across the entire ecosystem.
By identifying and addressing these common vulnerabilities, organisations can take proactive steps to enhance the cybersecurity posture of their supply chains, reducing the risk of costly breaches and disruptions.
Cybersecurity testing plays a pivotal role in enhancing the resilience of the supply chain by proactively identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. By conducting rigorous testing, organisations can evaluate the effectiveness of their security measures, identify gaps, and implement necessary improvements to fortify their defences.
Cybersecurity testing techniques, such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, can uncover weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes, allowing organisations to take corrective actions before malicious actors can exploit them. By simulating real-world attack scenarios, cybersecurity testing can help organisations refine their threat detection and incident response capabilities, ensuring they are better prepared to respond swiftly and effectively to potential cyber incidents.
Engaging in regular cybersecurity testing promotes a heightened awareness of security risks and challenges within the organisation, fostering a culture of vigilance and proactive risk management. Many industries and sectors have stringent cybersecurity regulations and standards in place. Cybersecurity testing can help organisations demonstrate compliance and mitigate the risk of hefty fines or legal consequences.
By leveraging the power of cybersecurity testing, organisations can fortify the resilience of their supply chains, safeguarding against potential disruptions, data breaches, and reputational damage, while fostering trust and confidence among stakeholders.
Cybersecurity testing encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies designed to assess and validate the security posture of systems, applications, and processes. In the context of supply chain security, several types of cybersecurity testing are relevant.
Vulnerability scanning assessments involve scanning and analysing systems, networks, and applications to identify known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Vulnerability assessments provide a comprehensive view of potential weaknesses and enable organisations to prioritise remediation efforts. External vulnerability scans aim to identify vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit from outside the organisation’s network. Internal vulnerability scans help to identify vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers who have already gained internal access, such as employees or contractors.
Penetration testing simulates real-world cyber attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of an organisation’s security controls and incident response capabilities. Penetration testers employ various techniques, such as network reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities, to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Examples include External Infrastructure Pen Tests, Internal Pen Tests, and Wi-Fi Tests.
As supply chains increasingly rely on web-based applications and platforms, it is crucial to assess the security of these applications. Web application security testing involves identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure authentication mechanisms.
In the context of software development and integration within the supply chain, secure code review involves analysing source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities, coding flaws, and non-compliance with secure coding practices.
Supply chains often involve human interactions, making them susceptible to social engineering attacks. Social engineering testing evaluates the effectiveness of security awareness training and the ability of employees to identify and respond to phishing attempts, pretexting, and other forms of deception.
Given the reliance on third-party vendors and partners within the supply chain, it is essential to assess their security posture and practices. Third-party risk assessments help organisations identify and mitigate potential risks introduced by external entities.
By employing a combination of these cybersecurity testing techniques, organisations can gain a comprehensive understanding of their supply chain’s security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and implement effective mitigation strategies to enhance overall resilience. Let’s explore a few in more detail:
Penetration testing simulates a real-time cyber attack against an app/software, system, or network under secure conditions. It is performed manually by a certified security expert to understand the strength of the security measures against attacks in real time. Unknown vulnerabilities, including zero-day threats and business logic flaws, are uncovered.
The typical process involves defining the scope of the test, including the systems, applications, and networks to be tested. Gather information about the target systems, such as IP addresses, domain names, and publicly available information. Scan the target systems using automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
Develop attack scenarios and threat models based on the identified vulnerabilities. Attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorised access or manipulate the target systems.
Collect data on the vulnerabilities exploited and any sensitive information accessed. Document the findings, including the vulnerabilities exploited, methods used, and potential impact. Provide recommendations for remediation.
Red team exercises involve the act of systematically and rigorously (but ethically) identifying an attack path that breaches the organisation’s security defence through real-world attack techniques. In adopting this adversarial approach, the organisation’s defences are based not on the theoretical capabilities of security tools and systems, but their actual performance in the presence of real-world threats. Red teaming is a critical component in accurately assessing the company’s prevention, detection, and remediation capabilities and maturity.
Red team exercises allow organisations to actively test their existing cyber defences and capabilities in a low-risk environment. This allows them to continuously evolve the organisation’s security strategy based on the company’s unique weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and the latest real-world attack techniques.
This enables organisations to identify misconfigurations and coverage gaps in existing security products, improve network security to detect targeted attacks and improve breakout time and increase healthy competition among security personnel and foster cooperation among IT and security teams. Generating security awareness among staff over the risk of human vulnerabilities which may compromise the organisation’s security is crucial. Develop skills and maturity in security capabilities within a safe training environment.
Van Buggenhout (2024) argues purple team exercises work better than red team exercises as they are run in a more collaborative way so both defenders and attackers work together more cohesively to identify routes in and improve runbooks and response mechanisms.3
Security code review is vital in secure software development. This aims to identify and rectify vulnerabilities in an application’s source code, reducing the risk of security breaches.
A security analyst examines the source code to identify potential security flaws and coding errors. Security code reviews should be integrated into the software development life cycle, conducted regularly, and tailored to the application’s specific technology stack and threat landscape.
Static application security testing (SAST) or code scanning automates the analysis of an application’s source code, bytecode, or binary code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors without executing the application. SAST tools break down your code, enabling them to probe deep into functions and subroutines for hidden vulnerabilities. They occasionally produce false positives, but these tools are adept at uncovering a wide array of potential threats, such as memory leaks, infinite loops, and unhandled errors.
Dynamic application security testing (DAST), or black-box testing, is a method for evaluating the security of an application while it’s running without any knowledge of its internal code or structure. This simulates real-world attack scenarios with valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities from an external perspective.
Key capabilities include runtime testing: DAST scanners interact with the application in real time, sending various inputs and requests to assess how the application responds. DAST scanners examine the application from an outsider’s perspective, just like a malicious attacker would.
DAST tools simulate various attack vectors, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), to identify vulnerabilities that could compromise the application’s security. DAST tools are particularly efficient when scanning large and complex applications because they do not require access to the source code. DAST tools can assess how well authentication and access controls are implemented by trying to bypass them through various means.
Ethical hacking involves security professionals attempting to breach a system’s defences in an authorised manner. This allows organisations to identify vulnerabilities and weak points from the perspective of an attacker. Ethical hackers use the techniques malicious hackers use to improve security.
Web application hacking: Ethical hackers focus on identifying weaknesses in web applications.
System hacking: Ethical hackers attempt to identify vulnerabilities within operating systems, software, and hardware components of computer systems.
Web server hacking: Ethical hackers assess web server configurations, access controls, and vulnerabilities that might allow attackers to compromise the server’s functionality or gain unauthorised access.
Database hacking: This involves identifying vulnerabilities within databases and their management systems. Ethical hackers aim to uncover issues such as SQL injection, insecure database configurations, and unauthorised data access.
Implementing effective cybersecurity testing within the supply chain requires a strategic and well-coordinated approach. To maximise the benefits of cybersecurity testing and ensure its successful integration, organisations should consider best practices.
Establish a comprehensive cybersecurity testing programme. Develop a structured programme that outlines the objectives, scope, methodologies, and frequency of cybersecurity testing activities. This programme should align with the organisation’s overall risk management strategy and be tailored to the specific needs and complexities of the supply chain.
Involve stakeholders and subject matter experts. Engage relevant stakeholders, including supply chain partners, security professionals, and subject matter experts, throughout the cybersecurity testing process. Their input and collaboration can provide valuable insights and ensure a comprehensive assessment of potential risks and vulnerabilities.
Integrate cybersecurity testing into the software development life cycle (SDLC). For organisations developing or integrating software within the supply chain, it is crucial to incorporate cybersecurity testing practices into the SDLC. This includes conducting secure code reviews, static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), and ensuring adherence to secure coding standards.
Adopt a risk-based approach to cybersecurity testing, focusing efforts on critical systems, applications, and processes that pose the highest risk to the supply chain. This approach ensures efficient allocation of resources and maximises the impact of testing activities.
Establish well-defined processes for identifying, prioritising, and remediating vulnerabilities discovered during cybersecurity testing. This includes developing and maintaining a centralised vulnerability management system, assigning responsible parties, and establishing timelines for remediation.
Encourage collaboration and information sharing among supply chain partners, industry associations, and relevant stakeholders. This can facilitate the exchange of threat intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned, enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of the supply chain ecosystem.
Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, necessitating continuous monitoring and adaptation of cybersecurity testing strategies. Regularly review and update testing methodologies, tools, and processes to ensure they remain effective and aligned with the latest threat landscape and industry best practices.
By adhering to these best practices, organisations can effectively integrate cybersecurity testing into their supply chain operations, fostering a proactive and resilient approach to cybersecurity and mitigating the risks posed by malicious actors.

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, vulnerability scanning is a critical component of any comprehensive security strategy. As the digital world continues to expand, organisations face an increasing number of threats, making it imperative to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is a process that involves systematically analysing systems, networks, and applications to detect and report on any weaknesses or flaws that could be leveraged by cybercriminals. These vulnerabilities can range from software bugs and misconfigurations to outdated or unpatched systems, all of which can leave an organisation exposed to various types of cyber attacks.
Sontan and Samuel (2024) argue the case for the use of AI-powered vulnerability scanners. By using AI to conducting regular vulnerability scans, organisations can gain valuable insights into their security posture, enabling them to prioritise and address the most critical vulnerabilities promptly. They argue that we can better prioritise critical vulnerabilities by applying machine learning algorithms to analyse extensive datasets. This proactive approach not only helps mitigate risks but also ensures compliance with industry regulations and standards.4
Mohaidat and Al-Helali (2024) contend that vulnerability scanning is vital in supply chain security. Supply chain security has become a paramount concern for organisations across various industries. With the increasing interconnectivity and complexity of modern supply chains, a single vulnerability in any part of the chain can have far-reaching consequences, potentially compromising the entire ecosystem.5
Jimmy (2024) argues vulnerability scanning plays a crucial role in securing the supply chain by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities at every stage. They argue the case for use of AI and cloud security tooling for conducting thorough scans of all systems, networks, and applications involved in the supply chain process so that organisations can detect and remediate vulnerabilities more quickly before they can be exploited by threat actors.6
Moreover, vulnerability scanning helps organisations maintain visibility and control over their supply chain partners’ security posture. By requiring supply chain partners to undergo regular vulnerability assessments and provide reports, organisations can ensure that their partners adhere to the same high security standards, minimising the risk of a breach originating from a third-party vendor or supplier.
Implementing a robust vulnerability scanning programme can provide numerous benefits in securing your supply chain. By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities proactively, organisations can significantly reduce the risk of cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents that could disrupt the supply chain operations.7
Many industry regulations and standards, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, mandate regular vulnerability assessments. Vulnerability scanning helps organisations demonstrate compliance and avoid costly penalties or legal ramifications.
Proactively addressing vulnerabilities is often more cost-effective than dealing with the consequences of a successful cyber attack, which can include remediation costs, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.
Vulnerability scanning provides organisations with a comprehensive view of their security posture, enabling them to make informed decisions and prioritise remediation efforts based on the criticality of the identified vulnerabilities.8
By implementing robust security measures, including vulnerability scanning, organisations can differentiate themselves from competitors and demonstrate their commitment to supply chain security, which can be a key factor in attracting and retaining customers.
Common vulnerabilities in supply chain systems must be constantly assessed. Supply chain systems are vulnerable to a wide range of threats. Outdated or unpatched software can introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals. Common software vulnerabilities include buffer overflows, cross-site scripting (XSS), and SQL injection.
Improperly configured systems, such as web servers, databases, or firewalls, can expose sensitive information or provide entry points for unauthorised access. Inadequate authentication and authorisation mechanisms, such as weak passwords or lack of multi-factor authentication, can allow unauthorised access to critical systems and data.
Unencrypted or poorly secured communication channels between supply chain partners can expose sensitive data in transit, making it vulnerable to interception and manipulation. Supply chain partners, such as vendors or suppliers, may have inadequate security measures in place, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced into the supply chain ecosystem.
Develop a comprehensive vulnerability management policy that outlines the scope, frequency, and procedures for conducting vulnerability scans, as well as the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders.
Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all systems, networks, and applications involved in the supply chain process. This inventory will serve as the foundation for your vulnerability scanning efforts.
Choose vulnerability scanning tools that are suitable for your organisation’s specific needs and infrastructure. Consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, and compatibility with existing systems.
Establish a schedule for conducting regular vulnerability scans across all identified assets. The frequency of scans should be based on the criticality of the assets and the organisation’s risk tolerance.
Develop a systematic approach to prioritising and remediating identified vulnerabilities. Consider factors such as the severity of the vulnerability, the potential impact on the supply chain, and the resources required for remediation.
Implement continuous monitoring and reporting mechanisms to ensure that vulnerabilities are promptly identified and addressed. Regular reporting to stakeholders and management can help maintain visibility and accountability.
Engage with supply chain partners and establish clear expectations for vulnerability management. Consider requiring partners to undergo regular vulnerability assessments and provide reports to ensure a consistent level of security across the entire supply chain ecosystem.
It is important to maximise the effectiveness of your vulnerability scanning efforts in securing your supply chain. Ensure that your vulnerability scanning programme covers all relevant assets, including systems, networks, applications, and devices involved in the supply chain process. Regularly update your asset inventory to account for changes and additions.
Implement automated and scheduled vulnerability scans to ensure consistent and timely assessments. This approach minimises the risk of overlooking vulnerabilities due to manual processes or resource constraints.
Conduct both credentialled (authenticated) and non-credentialled (unauthenticated) vulnerability scans to gain a comprehensive understanding of your security posture. Credentialled scans provide deeper insights into system configurations and vulnerabilities, while non-credentialled scans simulate external attacks.
Prioritise the remediation of vulnerabilities based on their risk level, considering factors such as the severity of the vulnerability, the criticality of the affected assets, and the potential impact on the supply chain operations.
Implement continuous monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect and respond to newly discovered vulnerabilities or changes in the security landscape.
Integrate your vulnerability scanning programme with other security tools and processes, such as patch management, incident response, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to security.
Establish secure and controlled processes for remediating identified vulnerabilities. This may include testing patches or updates in a secure environment before deploying them to production systems.
Provide regular training and awareness programmes for employees and supply chain partners to ensure a consistent understanding of vulnerability management best practices and the importance of supply chain security.
Selecting the appropriate vulnerability scanning tools is crucial for the success of your vulnerability management programme. Ensure that the chosen tools are compatible with your organisation’s existing systems, networks, and applications. This includes support for various operating systems, databases, and web applications.
Select tools that are scalable to accommodate the size and complexity of your supply chain ecosystem, including the ability to scan a large number of assets simultaneously. Evaluate the accuracy of the vulnerability scanning tools and their ability to minimise false positives, which can lead to wasted resources and unnecessary remediation efforts.
Look for tools that provide comprehensive reporting and intuitive dashboards, enabling you to easily visualise and analyse vulnerability data, track remediation efforts, and communicate findings to stakeholders.
Consider tools that offer automation capabilities and seamless integration with other security tools, such as patch management systems, SIEM solutions, and ticketing systems, to streamline vulnerability management processes. Evaluate the vendor’s reputation, support offerings, and commitment to regular updates and improvements to ensure that the tools remain effective and up to date with the latest vulnerabilities and threats.
Ensure that the chosen tools comply with relevant industry regulations and standards, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or ISO 27001, if applicable to your organisation. Vulnerability scanning plays a crucial role in helping organisations achieve and maintain compliance with various industry regulations and standards. Many regulatory bodies and frameworks, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST, mandate regular vulnerability assessments and the implementation of robust vulnerability management processes.
PCI DSS: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires organisations that handle credit card transactions to conduct regular vulnerability scans and remediate identified vulnerabilities to protect cardholder data.
