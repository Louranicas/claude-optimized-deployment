Chapter: 1868 - “It was flooded with lotteries, gambling dens and licensed brothels. Many of the city officials, as well as the police force, were thugs and murderers. Violence was rampant...”
The situation was dire, he continued. Most of the plantations were in ruin. The state was bitterly divided between Democrats and Republicans, rural and city, and there was no money in the state treasury. There were no cotton mills or other industries, few wharves or warehouses. The levees were in a deplorable condition. The state’s drinking water was polluted. Waste from the slaughterhouses was drained into the Mississippi. Yellow fever epidemics killed a large number of people each year. Transportation and communication between population centers were essentially nonexistent, as there was not a single hard-surfaced road and less than two hundred miles of usable railroad tracks in the entire state, and there was only limited access to the telegraph.
For an ambitious man like Henry Warmoth, it was a dream come true. By painting the bleakest possible picture of the state when he entered office, there was almost nothing he could do that would make things worse, while he would receive credit for any progress that took place whether he was responsible for it or not. To save the state, he made clear, he needed far more power than traditionally given to the governor. He needed control over the machinery of state.
And he set out to take it.
Warmoth was young and inexperienced but instinctively understood the mechanics of politics: being a successful politician required the accumulation of power. And patronage is the source of political power. He began rewarding his base, sprinkling loyalists throughout the government. At his direction, the Republicans who controlled the legislature created eight new parishes, allowing him to appoint a substantial number of new judges, district attorneys, constables, sheriffs, clerks, recorders and all the other officials who made the government function. He interpreted a newly passed state law to mean he was empowered to fill existing vacancies when the State Senate was not in session without its consent. It was a complicated, controversial and legally dubious approach, but it eventually enabled him to stack half of New Orleans city council with his supporters among other plum positions.
Next, he had to get rid of potential restraints on his use of power. Like countless people before him, as well as those who would follow him into politics after, Warmoth didn’t believe the laws applied to him. As far as he was concerned, laws were more a suggestion than a rule. They should be subject to common sense, as he judged it, and “the great law of necessity.”
“As Chief Executive,” he once explained to a legislative committee, “the Governor has the power to do anything which, in his judgment, is necessary in seeing that the laws are properly executed...
“There is a distinction between laws being interpreted and laws being executed.”
He meant it too. According to a popular story being told in New Orleans, when the grand duke of Russia, Alexei Romanov, had visited the city he said to Warmoth, “Governor, they tell me you have as much power as my father.”
“Your father? Hell,” Warmoth supposedly responded, “your father’s power is not a circumstance to mine.”
He’d learned how to slip around the law early; ironically, he had become a lawyer when he was only eighteen years old, lying about his age to be admitted into practice. As governor, in addition to controlling the courts through his appointments, he wanted to be able to enforce his interpretation of the law. Citing the need to stop the violence that had plagued the state prior to the election, with the acquiescence of the newly constituted city council, he created a new five-hundred-man police force. The new Metropolitan Police, consisting almost entirely of Black veterans of the Union army, supposedly was formed to assist sheriffs in keeping the law but in fact acted as Warmoth’s militia. Clad in black-and-red uniforms they became highly visible in the streets of New Orleans and surrounding areas.
He asserted his authority by firing state officials. “As the Chief Executive of the State, I have control of all the militia, of all the sheriffs, of all the constables and of all the police forces organized in the state, and they are under my orders whenever, in my judgment, it is necessary to use them,” he testified in a hearing challenging his dismissals. And then he added, “That is my interpretation of the (state) constitution.”
The attorney questioning him noted, perhaps sarcastically, “Now we understand what your powers are.”
Warmoth disagreed. “I haven’t told you half of them yet,” he responded.
The law, he made clear, was whatever he said it was. Then he proceeded to act that way. He claimed he had the right to issue a writ compelling sheriffs to arrest anyone he believed should be arrested. At one point, he requested and signed a clearly unconstitutional bill permitting police to clean up the streets of New Orleans by arresting vagrants. At another time, he suspended the district attorney of Natchitoches Parish, even though he did not have power over the judicial branch of the government.
Inevitably, there was opposition to his actions. In a front-page story, the Times-Picayune described him in headlines as “A Governor Who is Above the Law,” who “is the very essence of despotic rule.” In response, Warmoth attacked the “venal and subsidized” media: “I told the people that if half the lies the newspapers had told about me were true, I ought to be in the penitentiary for life, thereby depriving them of the services of the best Governor the state has ever had in its history.”
The relationship between the media and politicians has always been symbiotic, but complex and difficult. The actions of politicians affect every citizen, so it is the obligation of the media to report them. Newspaper publishers and editors like New York’s Horace Greeley, for example, even went into politics.
How the media cover them becomes the question. It often pays to be supportive, figuratively and literally. Those outlets providing positive spin may get exclusive interviews and early access to stories. And there is a lot of money to be made. By law, states are required to publish a significant amount of material, ranging from legislative actions to notices about elections, and the newspapers awarded those contracts can count on reliable government payments. After taking office Warmoth had a law passed setting fees for publishing official state information, raising the normal rates in some cases as much as 500 percent and establishing a printing commission to designate those newspapers that would get the business. About thirty-five papers around the state received state revenue, and in several situations those funds supported their entire business.
The three members of that commission were Warmoth, Lieutenant Governor Dunn and the Republican speaker of the house.
The commission also selected the New Orleans Republican to be the state’s official journal. The fact that Warmoth owned 250 of the 1,100 issued shares in the paper, allowing him to share in the profits, apparently was not revealed in the journal.
But opposition papers, especially the popular Times-Picayune, furiously attacked him, claiming, “In that position (as head of the printing commission), he has voted his own printing company the fattest of the subsidies. Under this system about a half million dollars has been appropriated to a fungous and mercenary press, which has earned its infamous wages by calumniating a people who were robbed and oppressed that it might flourish in insolence and impunity.”
The ambitious Warmoth also had to secure his own political as well as financial future. Having been elected the second youngest governor in American history, his prospects were seemingly endless. He already was gaining national attention. His handling of the election riots in October 1868 had received substantial coverage. A young Midwesterner acceptable to the South, who could claim support from both Black and white citizens, was definitely an intriguing prospect. When assessing candidates for the 1870 Senate race in Louisiana, the New York Herald included him near the top, despite the fact that “Governor Warmoth is too young to enter the lists, his age not reaching the required thirty summers.”
As promising as his future might be on the national stage, before any of that could happen he had to protect his political future within the state. That was a problem. Louisiana law limited its governors to a single term. That law would have to be changed to suit Warmoth’s interests. In March 1870, buried beside the news that thirty states had ratified the Fifteenth Amendment was the news that the legislature had proposed four amendments to the state constitution to be voted on the following November. One of them restored the right to vote to all Confederate soldiers. That was certain to be popular with the opposition party. But the last one would not be, though it was the key to Warmoth’s future. It removed Article 50, “which provides that the Governor shall be ineligible for reelection at the end of his four year term,” from the constitution.
In addition to the Democrats’ opposition, several Republicans who had been planning to run for the post objected to this power grab. Among them was the Black lieutenant governor, Oscar Dunn. It caused a crack in the party, a hint of the split that would soon follow.
As it turned out, far more important than the proposed amendments were several bills changing the electoral system. The Constitution grants states the power to determine “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections.” While the right to vote became subject to federal laws following the Civil War, no laws dictate how each state counts the votes. And throughout American history, the manner in which votes are counted—and who does the counting—has made all the difference.
The system hadn’t changed much in half a century. After the polls closed, the boxes were opened and the votes were counted by hand. The “returns” from each box were reported to a central location and added together.
Although, changes were on the horizon. A year earlier, in 1869, a young inventor named Thomas Edison had received his first patent, for a mechanical voting machine to be used to tally votes in Congress. Still, it would be decades before the appearance of lever-operated voting machines.
Few voters knew how the system worked. They cast their vote and went home. Several days later newspapers reported the result. Politicians relied on that lack of interest. So few voters paid attention when the legislature changed the registration and election laws.
But politicians did. They recognized that the new laws gave Warmoth significant control over the electoral system.
Under these new laws, the governor appointed the chief election officer and the supervisor of voters in each parish. Supervisors fixed the day, time and places the polls would be open. They also were empowered to name a commissioner of elections at each polling place to oversee conduct of the voting and return the boxes to the state. Registrars also were responsible for registering potential voters and supplying lists of legally registered voters to the poll commissioners.
A supervisor’s decision was final and could not be appealed to the courts.
Most importantly, although almost no one realized it, was a law that established a Returning Board, which made the final determination about the election. The board had the power to settle all disputes; its members were authorized to examine claims of fraud or irregularities and could simply throw out the results in any precinct or parish that in their sole opinion had been unduly influenced by fraud or violence. It gave them the power to discard returns for just about any reason.
The five-man board was composed of Warmoth and Dunn, the secretary of state and two Republican senators.
These new election laws put Warmoth in control of the entire process, from registration through vote counting, virtually assuring his own reelection as well as the fate of other candidates. Elected representatives recognized his power and were careful not to attack him. As one assembly member said when asked his opinion, “Not that I have anything against the governor himself, but I think it improper to give such extraordinary power to any man, were he an apostle.”
Another member added cautiously, “Although I would have the greatest confidence in whatever he reported.”
There had never been a politician quite like Warmoth. He was an outsider who had succeeded by gaining the support of other outsiders, people who previously had been excluded from the process, people who felt they were powerless. He told them what they wanted to hear. He made them feel good about themselves. And he took action to defend their rights, creating and heavily arming a state militia that would protect not only him but Black citizens. And if he wasn’t always truthful or even accurate, his supporters didn’t seem to care. He understood another fundamental rule of politics: many people won’t care if you’re dishonest, as long as you’re fulfilling their demands with your dishonesty.
For newly enfranchised Black voters he was a revelation. Most previous state government officials had supported slavery, so whatever Warmoth did—and how he did it—was a significant improvement.
He also was personally appealing. Supporters and opponents alike agreed he was charming; he was young, good-looking, well-spoken and very publicly single. The bachelor Warmoth cut a dashing figure in New Orleans. He had a great backstory; he had come to Louisiana as a poor lawyer, his entire fortune a twenty-dollar gold piece in his pocket, and he had once been thrown out of an office-apartment for failing to pay the rent, but he had worked hard and been successful. Like the rags-to-riches hero of Horatio Alger’s Ragged Dick, which had just been published, he was a self-made man of the people. They looked at him and saw what was possible for themselves or their children. And so they turned out to vote for him.
The four amendments were on the ballot the following November. That election, he later said, “was admitted by everybody in the state...the quietest and fairest election ever held in Louisiana up to that time.”
The facts were different. There were widespread allegations of fraud on both sides. According to Republican reports, “in at least a dozen parishes [Black] men were intimidated from voting.” And according to Democratic newspapers, newly appointed parish supervisors set up registration centers thirty to fifty miles from Democratic areas and did not keep them open for regular hours. The canniest among them was Bossier Parish supervisor Daniel Cady Stanton, the son of abolitionist and women’s rights leader Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Carpetbagger Stanton had arrived in Bossier only two months earlier. In addition to limiting the opportunities to register, he opened only four polling stations and kept no list of registered voters in two of them, so no one knew who or how many people had voted. On election day voters discovered that Stanton himself had replaced another candidate on the ballot.
Not surprisingly, he was elected to the state legislature.
While Republicans controlled the voting, Democrats tried to gain control of the counting. In Baton Rouge, as Republican supervisors were opening the ballot boxes, the doors burst open, and the intruders began shooting. Four Black men were killed, and about twenty more people were wounded. Only the arrival of federal troops prevented more deaths. In Donaldsonville, a town several miles outside Baton Rouge that had elected America’s first Black mayor only two years earlier, armed Democrats surrounded the courthouse where the ballot boxes were being opened. Fearing violence, the supervisor decided to take the boxes across the river where federal troops offered protection. As they began moving the boxes, members of the mob opened fire, killing one man and wounding several others.
The election officials retreated to the courthouse.
The stalemate was broken the next morning when Warmoth’s Black militia arrived, threatening to burn down the town unless the ballot boxes were given to them. After several more people were shot on both sides, the militia marched into town and the ballot boxes were handed over.
As expected, when the votes finally were counted, all four amendments had been approved. Warmoth no longer faced term limits. Republicans won all the Congressional races, retained control of the state legislature and took control of New Orleans’s city government. It was an overwhelming victory—and naturally, the Returning Board approved all the results.
Warmoth had become a political force. He had, complained his detractors, “with his bold and efficacious measures” made himself the center of state government. The South had never seen a politician like him. Ulysses Grant invited him to the White House, where he dined privately with the president and his family. He was only twenty-eight years old.
Grant needed all the Republican supporters he could gather. He intended to run for reelection in two years, and the Republican party was split while Democrats were united against him. The Civil War was over but there was no real peace. North and South were battling over the country’s future. “At the North,” explained the New Orleans Republican, “the South is represented as a desperato, with a slouched hat and a revolver. At the South the North is pictured as a burglar with a slouched hat and a revolver.”
The Times-Picayune was far blunter. In response to a New York Times editorial, it presented the Southern position, writing that the Times “has reasons in abundance to justify the hate of the North against the South. The fact that this hate does exist has produced a corresponding hatred of the South toward the North. The North commenced the work of hate. It invaded the Southern states. It has killed half a million or so of its people and for six years has carried out its hate in measures unsurpassed for their tyranny and malignity...
“We hate the people of the North as they hate us.”
Throughout the South, the president’s Reconstruction policies were failing to take hold. Now that they had been brought back to the Union, the Southern states were demanding the decision-making rights granted to them in the Constitution. They focused hard on the words the consent of the governed while resisting attempts to expand suffrage to all. But having tasted freedom, Black Americans were not taking a step back. Grant was trying desperately to satisfy both sides. “The Southerners are passionate,” he explained. “It is absolutely necessary to give political passions a sufficient time to pass away. The young generation comprehends its duties and interests better...”
But recognizing the rise of the KKK and other white supremacist organizations, he authorized the newly created Department of Justice to send troops into the South to protect Black citizens.
Southern leaders continued to insist that the federal government had limited authority, if any, over the states, even while Grant was imposing new laws.
Somehow Warmoth had been able to stake out a middle ground. While he relied on Republican support, he portrayed himself as a politician above the party fray, demonstrating his independence when votes were at stake. During his first two years in office, he vetoed thirty-nine bills sent to him by the legislature, claiming many of them were fiscally irresponsible. He declared himself the guardian of the pocketbook, vowing not to spend taxpayer money on folly, and angering legislators by turning down funding requests for their local projects. He refused to sign legislation directing St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans to be paved with wooden blocks at a cost of $1,500,000. He vetoed a bill handing control of the city’s practically nonexistent drainage system to a new private company and amended the state constitution to set debt limits. Many of the bills he did sign benefited Louisianians of both parties. His promises to “bring railroads, open natural watercourses and facilitate ocean commerce” proved popular. He provided funds for the restoration of the levees and the expansion of railroads throughout the state and into Texas. He supported increased funding for public education, granted people who owed back taxes additional time to repay and removed the final restrictions on men who had fought for the Confederacy.
He made attempts to appease Democrats in his political appointments, putting numerous Confederate veterans in state offices, including making General James Longstreet commander of the state militia and General Jeff Thompson chief state engineer. When Republicans objected, he tried to mollify them by appointing Black men to well-paying positions as well.
But despite his efforts, there was no middle ground on race. The majority of Republicans were Black; the Democrats were almost all white. Republicans demanded civil rights be extended and protected, while Democrats were terrified Black politicians would take control of the state. Every attempt Warmoth made to satisfy one side angered the other. Once, a Black Democrat was addressing a Canal Street rally when Black Republicans arrived to confront him. He was, they said, a traitor. There was a real chance that violence would erupt.
This was a chance to remind Black voters that the governor was defending their rights, even in an unpleasant situation. Warmoth rushed to the scene and “fearlessly,” according to the Democratic papers, got up on the platform and told the Republicans, “I come here to ask that freedom of speech, which, as Republicans we demand for everybody. This Black citizen of Louisiana has as much right to his own opinions as you or I have to our own... He must be permitted to speak when and where he pleases...”
The Republicans dispersed.
But his own powers of persuasion could not work in every case, and there seemed no possible compromise when the legislature passed a civil rights bill and sent it to him for signature. The bill made it a crime to deny any citizen equal accommodations on a railroad, streetcar or steamboat, or in a hotel or theater. The bill had been proposed by Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback, a Black Union officer elected to the State Senate in 1868, who had declared that Black citizens would no longer accept being “refused a drink of common whisky in a common grog-shop.” His bill would essentially integrate the state. To Democrats it was an anathema, worse even than the amendments Washington was trying to force on them.
Lieutenant Governor Dunn strongly supported Pinchback’s bill. He had not forgiven Warmoth for pushing through legislation allowing the governor to run for a second term. He knew that this civil rights bill put Warmoth in a box: veto it and lose the support of the Black community, or sign it and lose support among both Democratic and even some Republican white voters.
Initially Warmoth relied on a pocket veto, letting the bill sit unsigned on his desk until the legislative term ended. But when the legislature passed it a second time he had little choice but to respond. In early February 1869, the same day President Grant told reporters that Black citizens would not be invited to his inaugural ball, Warmoth was forced to explain to Black legislators why he had vetoed their bill, telling them, “We cannot hope by legislation to control questions of personal association; much less can we hope to force on those who differ from our views of what is humane, or courteous or Christianlike...”
It was a marvel of political rhetoric, criticizing Democratic party values while serving their interests. But it did little to soften the blow.
Pinchback and Dunn knew serious damage had been inflicted on Warmoth, but they accepted his veto. “I consider myself just as far above coming into company that does not want me,” Pinchback said, “as they are above my coming into an elevation with them...” But, he added, while he was not going to force anyone to associate with other people, he continued to demand equal accommodation.
Besides, he noted, the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by the legislature legally gave Black citizens all the rights included in this bill.
Although nothing was said about enforcing those rights.
Where Warmoth was most vulnerable was corruption. Southern politicians and newspapers had successfully created the image of corrupt northerners who raced down south after the war to “steal enough to fill his carpet bag.” Warmoth’s opponents had begun referring to him as “the Prince of carpetbaggers.” In America, politics had always been a profitable profession, and voters had always resented the fact. Almost a half century earlier Andrew Jackson had run for the presidency as the anti-corruption candidate. In 1860 the New York Times had described Washington, DC, as a place where “the prize of life is a grab at the contents of UNCLE SAM’s till.” While many Louisianians begrudgingly accepted corruption as a by-product of government, few politicians had been as open about engaging in it as Warmoth. Although officially his annual salary was $8,000, the general perception was that he had managed to collect as much as $100,000 during his first year in office. People didn’t know whether to be impressed at the incredible amount or appalled by it. When a committee asked him about it, he admitted he had made that claim to a friend but refused to confirm it was true.
Bribes were common, and few bills were introduced or passed from which someone did not stand to profit. Bills that failed simply hadn’t been paid for properly. For example, Warmoth claimed he had vetoed the bill to pave St. Charles Avenue out of a sense of moral rectitude because he had been offered a $50,000 bribe and a share of the construction company’s profits by a man named John Walsh. Walsh disputed Warmoth’s account of upright behavior, instead claiming that the real reason the governor had vetoed the bill was that he demanded $75,000. When Warmoth called him a liar, Walsh challenged him to a duel, a challenge the governor turned down.

These new election laws put Warmoth in control of the entire process, from registration through vote counting, virtually assuring his own reelection as well as the fate of other candidates. Elected representatives recognized his power and were careful not to attack him. As one assembly member said when asked his opinion, “Not that I have anything against the governor himself, but I think it improper to give such extraordinary power to any man, were he an apostle.”
Another member added cautiously, “Although I would have the greatest confidence in whatever he reported.”
There had never been a politician quite like Warmoth. He was an outsider who had succeeded by gaining the support of other outsiders, people who previously had been excluded from the process, people who felt they were powerless. He told them what they wanted to hear. He made them feel good about themselves. And he took action to defend their rights, creating and heavily arming a state militia that would protect not only him but Black citizens. And if he wasn’t always truthful or even accurate, his supporters didn’t seem to care. He understood another fundamental rule of politics: many people won’t care if you’re dishonest, as long as you’re fulfilling their demands with your dishonesty.
For newly enfranchised Black voters he was a revelation. Most previous state government officials had supported slavery, so whatever Warmoth did—and how he did it—was a significant improvement.
He also was personally appealing. Supporters and opponents alike agreed he was charming; he was young, good-looking, well-spoken and very publicly single. The bachelor Warmoth cut a dashing figure in New Orleans. He had a great backstory; he had come to Louisiana as a poor lawyer, his entire fortune a twenty-dollar gold piece in his pocket, and he had once been thrown out of an office-apartment for failing to pay the rent, but he had worked hard and been successful. Like the rags-to-riches hero of Horatio Alger’s Ragged Dick, which had just been published, he was a self-made man of the people. They looked at him and saw what was possible for themselves or their children. And so they turned out to vote for him.
The four amendments were on the ballot the following November. That election, he later said, “was admitted by everybody in the state...the quietest and fairest election ever held in Louisiana up to that time.”
The facts were different. There were widespread allegations of fraud on both sides. According to Republican reports, “in at least a dozen parishes [Black] men were intimidated from voting.” And according to Democratic newspapers, newly appointed parish supervisors set up registration centers thirty to fifty miles from Democratic areas and did not keep them open for regular hours. The canniest among them was Bossier Parish supervisor Daniel Cady Stanton, the son of abolitionist and women’s rights leader Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Carpetbagger Stanton had arrived in Bossier only two months earlier. In addition to limiting the opportunities to register, he opened only four polling stations and kept no list of registered voters in two of them, so no one knew who or how many people had voted. On election day voters discovered that Stanton himself had replaced another candidate on the ballot.
Not surprisingly, he was elected to the state legislature.
While Republicans controlled the voting, Democrats tried to gain control of the counting. In Baton Rouge, as Republican supervisors were opening the ballot boxes, the doors burst open, and the intruders began shooting. Four Black men were killed, and about twenty more people were wounded. Only the arrival of federal troops prevented more deaths. In Donaldsonville, a town several miles outside Baton Rouge that had elected America’s first Black mayor only two years earlier, armed Democrats surrounded the courthouse where the ballot boxes were being opened. Fearing violence, the supervisor decided to take the boxes across the river where federal troops offered protection. As they began moving the boxes, members of the mob opened fire, killing one man and wounding several others.
The election officials retreated to the courthouse.
The stalemate was broken the next morning when Warmoth’s Black militia arrived, threatening to burn down the town unless the ballot boxes were given to them. After several more people were shot on both sides, the militia marched into town and the ballot boxes were handed over.
As expected, when the votes finally were counted, all four amendments had been approved. Warmoth no longer faced term limits. Republicans won all the Congressional races, retained control of the state legislature and took control of New Orleans’s city government. It was an overwhelming victory—and naturally, the Returning Board approved all the results.
Warmoth had become a political force. He had, complained his detractors, “with his bold and efficacious measures” made himself the center of state government. The South had never seen a politician like him. Ulysses Grant invited him to the White House, where he dined privately with the president and his family. He was only twenty-eight years old.
Grant needed all the Republican supporters he could gather. He intended to run for reelection in two years, and the Republican party was split while Democrats were united against him. The Civil War was over but there was no real peace. North and South were battling over the country’s future. “At the North,” explained the New Orleans Republican, “the South is represented as a desperato, with a slouched hat and a revolver. At the South the North is pictured as a burglar with a slouched hat and a revolver.”
The Times-Picayune was far blunter. In response to a New York Times editorial, it presented the Southern position, writing that the Times “has reasons in abundance to justify the hate of the North against the South. The fact that this hate does exist has produced a corresponding hatred of the South toward the North. The North commenced the work of hate. It invaded the Southern states. It has killed half a million or so of its people and for six years has carried out its hate in measures unsurpassed for their tyranny and malignity...
“We hate the people of the North as they hate us.”
Throughout the South, the president’s Reconstruction policies were failing to take hold. Now that they had been brought back to the Union, the Southern states were demanding the decision-making rights granted to them in the Constitution. They focused hard on the words the consent of the governed while resisting attempts to expand suffrage to all. But having tasted freedom, Black Americans were not taking a step back. Grant was trying desperately to satisfy both sides. “The Southerners are passionate,” he explained. “It is absolutely necessary to give political passions a sufficient time to pass away. The young generation comprehends its duties and interests better...”
But recognizing the rise of the KKK and other white supremacist organizations, he authorized the newly created Department of Justice to send troops into the South to protect Black citizens.
Southern leaders continued to insist that the federal government had limited authority, if any, over the states, even while Grant was imposing new laws.
Somehow Warmoth had been able to stake out a middle ground. While he relied on Republican support, he portrayed himself as a politician above the party fray, demonstrating his independence when votes were at stake. During his first two years in office, he vetoed thirty-nine bills sent to him by the legislature, claiming many of them were fiscally irresponsible. He declared himself the guardian of the pocketbook, vowing not to spend taxpayer money on folly, and angering legislators by turning down funding requests for their local projects. He refused to sign legislation directing St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans to be paved with wooden blocks at a cost of $1,500,000. He vetoed a bill handing control of the city’s practically nonexistent drainage system to a new private company and amended the state constitution to set debt limits. Many of the bills he did sign benefited Louisianians of both parties. His promises to “bring railroads, open natural watercourses and facilitate ocean commerce” proved popular. He provided funds for the restoration of the levees and the expansion of railroads throughout the state and into Texas. He supported increased funding for public education, granted people who owed back taxes additional time to repay and removed the final restrictions on men who had fought for the Confederacy.
He made attempts to appease Democrats in his political appointments, putting numerous Confederate veterans in state offices, including making General James Longstreet commander of the state militia and General Jeff Thompson chief state engineer. When Republicans objected, he tried to mollify them by appointing Black men to well-paying positions as well.
But despite his efforts, there was no middle ground on race. The majority of Republicans were Black; the Democrats were almost all white. Republicans demanded civil rights be extended and protected, while Democrats were terrified Black politicians would take control of the state. Every attempt Warmoth made to satisfy one side angered the other. Once, a Black Democrat was addressing a Canal Street rally when Black Republicans arrived to confront him. He was, they said, a traitor. There was a real chance that violence would erupt.
This was a chance to remind Black voters that the governor was defending their rights, even in an unpleasant situation. Warmoth rushed to the scene and “fearlessly,” according to the Democratic papers, got up on the platform and told the Republicans, “I come here to ask that freedom of speech, which, as Republicans we demand for everybody. This Black citizen of Louisiana has as much right to his own opinions as you or I have to our own... He must be permitted to speak when and where he pleases...”
The Republicans dispersed.
But his own powers of persuasion could not work in every case, and there seemed no possible compromise when the legislature passed a civil rights bill and sent it to him for signature. The bill made it a crime to deny any citizen equal accommodations on a railroad, streetcar or steamboat, or in a hotel or theater. The bill had been proposed by Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback, a Black Union officer elected to the State Senate in 1868, who had declared that Black citizens would no longer accept being “refused a drink of common whisky in a common grog-shop.” His bill would essentially integrate the state. To Democrats it was an anathema, worse even than the amendments Washington was trying to force on them.
Lieutenant Governor Dunn strongly supported Pinchback’s bill. He had not forgiven Warmoth for pushing through legislation allowing the governor to run for a second term. He knew that this civil rights bill put Warmoth in a box: veto it and lose the support of the Black community, or sign it and lose support among both Democratic and even some Republican white voters.
Initially Warmoth relied on a pocket veto, letting the bill sit unsigned on his desk until the legislative term ended. But when the legislature passed it a second time he had little choice but to respond. In early February 1869, the same day President Grant told reporters that Black citizens would not be invited to his inaugural ball, Warmoth was forced to explain to Black legislators why he had vetoed their bill, telling them, “We cannot hope by legislation to control questions of personal association; much less can we hope to force on those who differ from our views of what is humane, or courteous or Christianlike...”
It was a marvel of political rhetoric, criticizing Democratic party values while serving their interests. But it did little to soften the blow.
Pinchback and Dunn knew serious damage had been inflicted on Warmoth, but they accepted his veto. “I consider myself just as far above coming into company that does not want me,” Pinchback said, “as they are above my coming into an elevation with them...” But, he added, while he was not going to force anyone to associate with other people, he continued to demand equal accommodation.
Besides, he noted, the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by the legislature legally gave Black citizens all the rights included in this bill.
Although nothing was said about enforcing those rights.
Where Warmoth was most vulnerable was corruption. Southern politicians and newspapers had successfully created the image of corrupt northerners who raced down south after the war to “steal enough to fill his carpet bag.” Warmoth’s opponents had begun referring to him as “the Prince of carpetbaggers.” In America, politics had always been a profitable profession, and voters had always resented the fact. Almost a half century earlier Andrew Jackson had run for the presidency as the anti-corruption candidate. In 1860 the New York Times had described Washington, DC, as a place where “the prize of life is a grab at the contents of UNCLE SAM’s till.” While many Louisianians begrudgingly accepted corruption as a by-product of government, few politicians had been as open about engaging in it as Warmoth. Although officially his annual salary was $8,000, the general perception was that he had managed to collect as much as $100,000 during his first year in office. People didn’t know whether to be impressed at the incredible amount or appalled by it. When a committee asked him about it, he admitted he had made that claim to a friend but refused to confirm it was true.
Bribes were common, and few bills were introduced or passed from which someone did not stand to profit. Bills that failed simply hadn’t been paid for properly. For example, Warmoth claimed he had vetoed the bill to pave St. Charles Avenue out of a sense of moral rectitude because he had been offered a $50,000 bribe and a share of the construction company’s profits by a man named John Walsh. Walsh disputed Warmoth’s account of upright behavior, instead claiming that the real reason the governor had vetoed the bill was that he demanded $75,000. When Warmoth called him a liar, Walsh challenged him to a duel, a challenge the governor turned down.

The bribery system wasn’t a secret, and Warmoth wasn’t alone. Supposedly, on occasion bribes were paid in cash on the House floor. It was rumored that an office had been opened where people willing to pay for legislation would make their deals.
Testifying in front of a committee of concerned citizens formed to investigate corruption, Warmoth said, “Do you know a proposition of bribes is a matter of almost everyday occurrence, and if I should come forward and publish the men who offered me the bribe what would be the result? The Democratic press would attack me, and instead of giving me credit, would say I have made enough money, and consequently did not care to make any more.”
The people paying those bribes, he added, were “the very best people of this city.” By best he meant the wealthiest. When a grand jury formed after the investigation challenged him to reveal their identity, he refused, pointing out accurately that there were no laws that prohibited offering or accepting bribes in Louisiana.
It wasn’t just bribery. Politicians had discovered numerous ways of profiting from their office, many of them not even technically illegal. For example, there was no law prohibiting the governor from awarding the lucrative state printing contract to a publishing company in which he was a partner. And it was widely believed that Warmoth—just like many other legislators—profited from inside information. Knowing what legislation was proposed, they could buy shares in companies at a modest price and then sell them for a profit after passing a bill that benefited them.
Kickbacks were common and expected. People who were given state jobs, often at exorbitant salaries, were expected to pay for them out of those salaries.
By 1870 Warmoth had established himself as an experienced, clever politician. Few people doubted he would be reelected in two years. In fact, one of the state’s US senators was leaving office, and there were strong whispers that after winning the gubernatorial election Warmoth, at that point old enough to take office, would resign and allow the legislature to appoint him to that seat. And after serving a Senate term...anything was possible.
Even those people who didn’t like him had to admit he had stabilized the state government. When he had taken office, the entire South was still reeling from the aftermath of the war. The old ways were done. People were anxious about their future. It seemed like no one was in charge. Their lives were being dictated by northern politicians in Washington. That no longer was true. Warmoth was in charge.
Due at least partially to his policies, the state’s economy was normalizing. The recovery was slow and too many people were still suffering, but at least there was a hint of optimism. One way of reinforcing that feeling was bringing back popular traditions. In New Orleans, nothing was more traditional, nothing made people happier, nothing provided more of a boost to the local economy than Mardi Gras.
Mardi Gras, a public party to welcome Lent, had been a tradition in the region since French explorers Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville and Sieur de Bienville landed there in
