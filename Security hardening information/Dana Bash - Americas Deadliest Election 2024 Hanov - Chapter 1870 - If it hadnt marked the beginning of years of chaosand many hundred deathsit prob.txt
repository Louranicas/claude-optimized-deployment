Chapter: 1870 - If it hadn’t marked the beginning of years of chaos—and many hundred deaths—it probably would have been quickly forgotten. But that’s not what happened.
The Custom House faction seized control of the party’s central committee. That meant they would make all the decisions about the party operations. Warmoth couldn’t afford to let that happen—literally. The ability to control legislation is precisely what lobbyists and campaign contributors pay for. Warmoth was an unusually clever man who believed that the best defense was an attack: he responded by creating his own committee, which then gained control of the convention.
He had become a master of the art of politics. Warmoth successfully forged a coalition between his remaining Republican supporters and Democrats to take away all state patronage from Dunn and the Custom House faction, greatly weakening that group.
The feud escalated. Dunn bitterly accused the governor of “selling out” Black voters and warned his supporters against taking any “bribes” Warmoth might offer them. Warmoth accused Dunn and the Custom House of using graft and corruption to maintain support.
It was a classic political brawl, a battle of words, threats and political deeds. But that changed in the summer of ’71 when the guns came out. While Warmoth was in Mississippi, recovering from an operation to repair an injury to his right foot suffered in a boating accident, Packard hastily scheduled a state party convention. The Custom House Republicans intended to take advantage of Warmoth’s absence to consolidate control of the party.
In the weeks leading up to that gathering, both sides used every possible method to ensure local political clubs sent their supporters to New Orleans. Hired thugs broke up meetings, threats were made, bribes were paid. The Democratic Picayune gleefully reported, “The whole Radical [Republican] party...is absorbed in this combat; public business and interest are utterly ignored and public money ruthlessly squandered to promote the fortunes of the one or the other faction. Every species of fraud, deceit, violence and trickery is employed to the same end.”
It was too good an opportunity for a politician as skilled as Warmoth to miss. The day before the convention opened, completely unexpectedly, he hobbled into New Orleans on crutches. The image was political gold: the wounded warrior returning to defend his city. Great crowds of his supporters greeted his triumphant arrival with a rally and cheers.
Packard panicked. The convention had been scheduled to take place in the State House. Somehow, Warmoth had to be kept out. As head of the central committee, Packard announced that the location had been changed. The state convention would now be held...in the Custom House. Only those delegates with official tickets would be permitted to enter.
And he issued the official tickets.
To make sure Warmoth and his followers were kept out, Packard deputized dozens of new US Marshals and called for military support. “To preserve the peace,” the Picayune noted with irony, the Custom House was surrounded by three infantry regiments, armed with two Gatling guns. They were supplemented by eighty police officers. Inside the massive building the newly sworn deputies guarded every door. There was no possible way Warmoth was going to get inside.
Warmoth didn’t care. Getting inside was never part of his plan. Far more important, reporters would be there to cover the confrontation. Warmoth never saw a reporter’s notebook he didn’t like. Praise him, criticize him, he didn’t seem to care, as long as they wrote about him. So he was going to hand them a great story.
His carriage arrived at the Custom House midmorning and was met there by more than a hundred loyal delegates. He managed to talk his way into the public building, but marshals prevented him from entering the courtroom. That was perfect. He called for a chair and struggled dramatically to stand on it—supported by his crutches. After silencing the crowd, he said, “We are called upon today to witness a sight which has never before been seen since the foundation of this government. We stand here today in the presence of three companies of the United States Army, who have been brought here to intimidate the free Republican voters of Louisiana.”
The commander of the troops told Warmoth to end the spectacle. The governor stood tall and told the crowd his Republican convention would be held at a building called Turner Hall and urged them to follow him there.
As he began hobbling slowly down the stairs, Custom House supporters crowded into the building. One of them attempted to kick away the governor’s crutches. The two sides started shouting threats. Pistols were drawn. A deputy marshal aimed his weapon at Warmoth. Instantly, a Warmoth man grabbed the gun.
The governor’s supporters crowded in to protect him. By the time they got him outside, several thousand people had gathered. He stood on his carriage and repeated his speech to deafening cheers. When he concluded his remarks, the incredibly enthusiastic crowd picked up the chant To Turner Hall!
As Warmoth’s carriage moved slowly up Canal Street his supporters stopped it. The two horses were unhitched, and several men picked up the shafts, pulling it themselves at a fireman’s run. They shouted loudly and gleefully as they led the crowd to the hall, “limited only by the supply of oxygen in their lungs.”
The opposition papers described the scene quite differently, writing, “Governor Warmoth attempted to force his way into the Customhouse without credentials or a ticket of admission. He was met at the front of the stairs by two officers of the convention, who put him out without ceremony or hesitation. He then attempted to address the crowd, but was driven from this position by an officer who would not permit him to open his mouth. The bolting governor then took to his carriage and incontinently fled, dragging behind him a crowd of officeholders and paid emissaries, who could find nothing else to do but take the place of the horses and drag their master in his carriage through the streets, like so many braying asses.”
Four thousand Black and white men, Republicans as well as many Democrats, jammed into Turner Hall. That convention began by the entire crowd singing the rousing song “John Brown,” then symbolically hanging an American flag from a window, which was marked by three cheers.
When Warmoth spoke, he railed against the presence of soldiers at the Custom House, telling an anecdote about a conversation between a friend of his and a Spaniard concerning the struggle for power between the Whigs and Democrats. “Said the Spaniard to him, ‘Sir, on which side of the contest is the army? In Spain, as the army goes, so goes the election.’ It has been our boast, up to this time, that the army of the United States has nothing to do with the election of candidates....” The crowd rose and cheered when he continued, “This is the first instance in our great republic when it has been otherwise.” He paused, then added softly, “May it be the last.”
He was just warming up. He played to the emotions of the aroused crowd, which punctuated every sentence with an ovation. “We want in this State and in this broad country, liberty of the people!” They cheered. “We want liberty for the white man and liberty for the Black man.” They cheered. “We want no Black man to have any right not accorded to every white man, and no white man to have any right not accorded to every Black man.
“That is the great landmark of the Republican party; that is the great beacon light by which we have steered through many years of war, bloodshed and unhappiness.” He looked out at the assembly and asked, “Shall we turn back now?”
They roared, “No! No! We will not turn back.”

If it hadn’t marked the beginning of years of chaos—and many hundred deaths—it probably would have been quickly forgotten. But that’s not what happened.

They roared, “No! No! We will not turn back.”

Meanwhile, at the Custom House Warmoth was denounced as a thief, a man who took bribes and “the greatest living practical liar.” Serious conversations took place about beginning impeachment hearings. The convention then endorsed President Grant for a second term and said that there was no longer a place for Warmoth—whose followers did not support Grant—in the Republican party. Finally, they declared that the New Orleans Republican would no longer be the official organ of the Republican party, threatening its publishing contract.
By the end of the day the rift was complete. The Republican party was in tatters. Warmoth no longer was assured of being the Republican nominee for governor in the next election. There was already speculation the Custom House faction would nominate the popular Lieutenant Governor Dunn, who would be an extremely formidable opponent.
A substantial number of the Black voters who had carried Warmoth to victory in ’68 were lost to him. So he began building a new coalition.
Everything had changed. And then everything changed again.
On November 22, Oscar Dunn died.
It was a stunning turn. He had died of “congestion of the brain,” his doctor announced. Apparently, he had been ailing for several weeks but rather than consulting a physician had been taking Dr. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, a cold medicine that contained opium or morphine and other common remedies. All the while he had met visitors in his home, among them Warmoth, and while they were distressed by his condition, no one believed it to be fatal.
By the time his family called the doctor it was too late. “Pneumonia had taken such a hold of the system that medical skill could not avail,” the doctor explained. He had lapsed into a coma and then, waking to utter the final words, “Come, Jesus. Jesus, come,” he had closed his eyes at last.
But even that detailed report did not stop the suspicions from spreading. Dunn’s death seemed far too convenient. Rumors began circulating, the lieutenant governor had been poisoned by one of Warmoth’s henchmen. There was no evidence of any kind, but the circumstances were enough for people who already believed Warmoth was capable of such an act to be certain he was guilty.
The city of New Orleans turned out for Dunn’s funeral. “Perhaps no public event in years has produced a demonstration so large in every respect,” the Picayune reported. “It was not only participated in by people of his own race, but by a large part of the white population, who have felt for the deceased a genuine respect... The sorrow of his death was widespread and general, confined to no class or condition of society.”
Five hundred police officers marched. Several bands played mournful tunes. The state militia, the local Masons, religious societies and political clubs joined the melancholy procession. And Henry Warmoth?
The governor was properly and publicly somber. He provided his private carriage to Dunn’s family and walked through New Orleans with the other pallbearers to the cemetery. Undoubtedly his mind was churning. The lieutenant governor was next in line to the governor. The State Senate would elect Dunn’s successor. If the position wasn’t filled, the speaker of the house, a Custom House leader, would be next in line.
The decision on which candidate to support was made even more pressing by the fact his political enemies were actively discussing impeachment. If Warmoth was impeached before Dunn’s replacement was in office, the speaker of the house would become governor.
Some politicians are instinctive: they make decisions based on what they feel at the moment. That wasn’t Warmoth. He was deliberative. He carefully calibrated every move to determine the potential pluses and minuses before moving forward. This time, though, he had to act quickly. It was believed his enemies would initiate impeachment hearings when the legislature convened as scheduled in early January. But if one of Warmoth’s men was next in line, there would be no political benefit in replacing him. The day after Dunn’s funeral he called the State Senate into special session.
The best choice for him was State Senator P. B. S. Pinchback. Not necessarily a good choice, as Pinchback was independent and ambitious and at times had voted against Warmoth, but he was Warmoth’s best choice. He was not in league with the Custom House. The opposition nominated its own candidate. The first vote was tied. Warmoth went to the floor of the Senate “to stiffen the members,” he said, by conversation, good manners, but most important, to make deals. Both sides offered bribes for support. “The chances are that the vote will be tied,” read a note received by one senator from Custom House leaders. “I can hold $5,000 ready to place in your hands if you change your vote to our man.”
It turned out that would have been a bargain. It supposedly cost Warmoth $15,000 to induce a senator to change his vote. Pinchback was elected.
This was all happening in smoke-filled back rooms and dark, quiet corners. Publicly, the honest men of the state legislature were busy doing the people’s business. But no one anticipated the turmoil that erupted when the official legislative session opened in early January.
The new legislative session started with the election of a speaker, expected to be Custom House leader George W. Carter. Carter and Warmoth had once been friends. Carter was the attorney who had successfully defended the governor against the embezzlement charges in Texas, and in response Warmoth had literally created a new parish in southwest Louisiana and arranged for Carter to be elected as its representative. But in the pursuit of power—and in this case, revenue from printing contracts—the two men had fallen out and become bitter enemies.
In response to Pinchback’s election in the special session, Custom House Republicans had negotiated a deal with Democrats to reject that vote and impeach the governor. That would make Carter the governor. But getting it done was extremely complicated. It required successfully manipulating a lot of parts—procedural and human—and there was doubt Carter could pull it off.
The impeachment process begins when the House brings charges against an elected official, who is then tried in the Senate. Once that official is impeached they are suspended from office until the Senate reaches a verdict. So Carter devised a different, perfectly legal strategy. He intended to impeach Warmoth, elevating himself to governor, then keep Warmoth in limbo by keeping friendly senators out of the chamber, denying the Senate the quorum it needed to conduct business. He arranged for fourteen senators to take a leisurely cruise on the federally owned revenue ship Wilderness; while the lower House debated, these men spent a week living mostly belowdecks and then were set ashore in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, out of legal reach of Louisiana law.
It was a clever plan, but Carter had made one huge mistake: he had underestimated his opponent. The South was still healing from Union General Sherman’s ruthless March to the Sea, in which his army burned everything in its path. It was an apt metaphor for the way in which Warmoth approached politics. He never played defense. He attacked.
He went after Carter, attempting to replace him as speaker. A complex battle of procedural motions basically ended in a stalemate. Marshal Packard raised the ante, bringing in federal troops, supposedly to preserve the peace—and then ordered the arrest of Warmoth, Pinchback, eighteen representatives and four senators for conspiring “by violence to eject the Speaker of the House, and (engaging) in bribery and corruption of divers members of said House of Representatives...and to incite riot.”
To incite riot. It was an extraordinary charge. The federal government was arresting the leaders of a state government. Warmoth was enraged, but he and the others surrendered peacefully. They were marched through a boisterous crowd to the federal courtroom inside the Custom House where they were made to wait several hours—supposedly because the proper forms were misplaced—then arraigned and released on bail.
Charges and countercharges were being hurled so rapidly it was impossible for citizens to keep pace. Warmoth called upon his Metropolitan Police to protect his members inside the Mechanics Institute where the legislature was meeting. Carter issued an order prohibiting police in the building. The next day several hundred neatly dressed “civilians” showed up, badges concealed under their coats, and took positions around the building.
Inside, Carter attempted to bring some kind of order to the House. Instead, one of the most bizarre spectacles ever seen in an American legislature unfolded. As soon as he gaveled the session to order, a motion was made by Warmoth’s representatives to declare the speaker’s chair vacant, and supposedly was approved by acclamation. But as the governor’s people moved forward to enforce that act, Carter leaned back in his chair and pointed at the door behind the speaker’s platform.
The door instantly swung open and thirty men, “thugs and Ku-Klux,” according to the New Orleans Republican, “swarmed around their leader and with hands upon their weapons showed a ready desire to shed blood...
“There was an instant of almost breathless anxiety. The Republican members realized that assassination stared them in the face, but determined if they must die to fall at their posts and awaited the attack... Had they exhibited the least panic at this astounding demonstration there is every reason to believe they would have been slaughtered like sheep...”
Later reports claimed the armed men included Deputy US Marshals and “three conspicuous long-haired Texans.”
Even as that session ended in chaos, several police officers took positions around Warmoth’s office after threats on his life were made. A large crowd of Carter’s supporters gathered outside the building, chanting, “Hang Warmoth! Hang Warmoth!”
Warmoth very publicly dismissed the danger. But the next day he again ordered a large number of armed Metropolitan Police officers to surround the Mechanics Institute. When they refused to admit Custom House representatives, Carter convened his legislature in a hall above a Royal Street saloon. Lacking sufficient members to conduct business he sent out the sergeant at arms to arrest and, by force if necessary, drag members to the groghouse. That night, as some members remained in hiding, armed “deputies” broke into private homes and brought them back under guard. Representative Walter Wheyland resisted, and in the melee two sergeants at arms shot and killed him. They were arrested and a coroner’s jury indicted Carter as an accessory to the murder.
The following day a once-again fittingly solemn Warmoth, accompanied by aides and reporters, attended Wheyland’s funeral. He made a point to pay tribute in time to make the evening’s editions.
The January 6 front page of the Picayune declared, “The Lord of Misrule appeared upon our streets last night.” While the paper was actually reporting about the beginning of Mardi Gras—“Revelers on the Streets!”—it was an apt description of the situation. Two legislatures were convening daily, but neither one could raise a quorum. Several members moved back and forth as it seemed like one side might be gaining an advantage. Democrats stayed quietly on the sidelines, resisting offers—Warmoth supposedly promised the speakership to a Democrat if that party supported him—knowing that a broken, dispirited Republican party was the best possible outcome for them. As the Democratic paper Bee reported, “It is evident that we no longer have any government—and are in a state of complete anarchy.”
When the Custom House finally accepted the reality that its legislature would never have a quorum, it made several forcible attempts to take control of the State House. On January 13, Carter issued a proclamation calling on citizens to take arms to help him overthrow the government. Warmoth appealed to Grant for federal troops, but the president refused to declare martial law or commit troops.
The next morning an estimated six thousand Custom House supporters filled the streets outside the Mechanics Institute. Several speeches were made—and once again, after each disparaging remark about Warmoth, the crowd chanted, “Hang him! Hang him!”
A final attempt to take over the legislature happened on the twenty-second. Two days before, Carter distributed handbills urging “TO ARMS! TO ARMS! TO ARMS!” The time and place to gather was announced, and people were urged to “let those who have dared to trample on your rights as freemen and citizens tremble until the marrow of their bones shakes. Let the cry be: DOWN WITH WARMOTH AND HIS THIEVING CREW... LIBERTY OR DEATH.”
Carter also issued a proclamation informing supporters that they would be sworn in as assistant sergeants at arms, giving them legal protection in “protecting their way.”
That night, perhaps in preparation, intruders broke into a militia armory and stole numerous rifles.
The city prepared for the showdown. Newspapers urged readers to stay away from the area. Shopkeepers locked their doors and lowered their shutters. Bankers and financial dealers shipped money boxes to Mobile, fearing an out-of-control mob would rampage through the city.
The showdown was scheduled for eleven o’clock The next morning four thousand men, carrying rifles, muskets, shotguns, revolvers and clubs, met by the ten-year-old statue of Henry Clay at the intersection of Canal and Royal Streets. More than two thousand members of the state militia and the Metropolitan Police department, armed with rifles and a battery of artillery, were waiting for them at the State House. A bloodbath seemed inevitable.
Carter addressed his “army,” exhorting them to get rid of “that creature who by fraud occupies the Chair of State.” He was a fine speaker and built the crowd to an emotional pitch. And while he warned this heavily armed mob against resorting to violence to oust Warmoth, they understood his real meaning had little to do with peace.
Incredibly, as he reached the crescendo of his remarks, his arms waving, his voice rising to a peak, he was handed a note from General William Emory, commander of the US Army in Louisiana, informing him that he had just received a telegram from the secretary of war in Washington: “The President directs you to hold your troops in readiness to suppress a conflict of armed bodies of men, should such occur, and to guard public property from pillage or destruction.”
Carter knew these supporters could not stand against regular army troops. Moving against this warning would invite loss of life. He paused, waited, then read the message out loud. It was greeted with unhappy murmurs. He quickly changed course and began calming the crowd. “It’s no use, gentlemen, we can’t fight against the United States government... As it stands now, you are not required to perform any further duty...you must deport yourselves every way as good citizens should...
“I command you now, that you do hereafter abstain from all violence; that you do nothing to bring on a collision with minions of usurped authority. Gentleman, I have done. For the present the question is settled. General Emory has whipped this fight.”
The crowd lingered for a time, unsure how to respond, then gradually drifted into the afternoon.
Perhaps desperate to surrender gracefully and preserve his honor, Carter ended up dueling with Metropolitan Police Superintendent General A. S. Badger. Each fired a single shot wide and announced they were satisfied.
The battle wasn’t quite done. President Grant had decided to support his brother-in-law James Casey, one of Warmoth’s political enemies, whom he had appointed to the lucrative position of running the ports. Republicans in Washington sent a House committee to Louisiana to try to settle the situation. The five-man committee interviewed numerous witnesses, who were permitted to testify to rumors, innuendo and newspaper stories. One witness, asked if he was testifying to facts, responded, “I am reciting facts which are generally believed... Of course, I cannot have any personal knowledge of many of the charges set forth...”
Looking back years later, Warmoth complained, “Every personal and political enemy of mine was given a chance at me... If one percent of the charges had been true I should still be in the State Penitentiary.”
The governor testified for several hours. At its conclusion one Republican member summed up the general feeling about Warmoth: “We cannot determine whether you are an angel from Heaven, or a Devil from Hell.”
The final report castigated Warmoth, although by the time it was issued the Custom House effort to take control had been defeated. But great damage had been done.
For Warmoth, there was no returning to the Republican party. But he was still very much an ambitious man, still held power as governor, and for someone as clever as he was there were other political paths he might forge. And so he set out in a different direction.
The prelude was over.

More than two millennia ago Plato praised democracy in the Republic, calling it “a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.” But then he added the warning, “Democracy passes into despotism.”
For thousands of years civilizations had been struggling to find a sustainable political system which provided the most benefit for the most people, at least most of the time. The results have been, at best, mixed.
By the beginning of the 1870s, historic monarchies and dictatorships were evolving into various forms of popular rule as governments, under pressure from within, searched for a structure that offered security and opportunity to its citizens. Borders and rulers were in flux. In England, while the benevolent Queen Victoria sat upon the throne, industrial working men had gotten the right to vote for an increasingly powerful Parliament. France’s Napoleon III, who had been elected that nation’s first president but declared himself emperor after being constitutionally barred from reelection, had been deposed in
