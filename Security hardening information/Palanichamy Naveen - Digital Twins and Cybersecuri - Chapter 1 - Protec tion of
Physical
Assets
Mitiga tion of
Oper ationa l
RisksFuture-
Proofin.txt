Digital twins are virtual representations or replicas of physical objects, sys -
tems, or processes. They are created using real-time data from their phys -
ical counterparts and advanced technologies such as sensors, internet of 
things (IoT) devices, and analytics. Digital twins aim to provide a compre -
hensive and dynamic understanding of physical assets, enabling organiza-tions to monitor, analyze, simulate, and optimize their performance.
The concept of digital twins originated from the field of computer-aided 
design (CAD) and simulation, where virtual models were created to test and validate designs before physical production. However, the concept has evolved beyond static models to encompass real-time data and interactive capabilities, creating a dynamic and interconnected relationship between the physical and digital realms.
Digital twins can range from simple models representing individual 
components or subsystems to complex replicas of entire systems or ecosys -
tems. They can be classified into two main types:
Product Digital Twins
These digital twins represent individual physical objects or products. They provide a virtual counterpart that can be monitored, analyzed, and opti-mized throughout its life cycle. For example, in manufacturing, product digital twins can simulate the performance of a specific machine, enabling predictive maintenance and optimization.

However, these models were static and lacked the real-time data integra-
tion and interactive capabilities of modern digital twins.
Erdős et al.  address the increasing demand for adaptive, offline-  
programmed robotic cells to reduce the time-consuming process of online programming. They introduce a design approach to transform existing physical workcells into parametric digital twins. This involves enhanc -
ing the accuracy of these twins through multi-level calibration methods, thereby ensuring the precision of offline-planned robotic operations. The approach is demonstrated through a belt grinding and polishing robotic cell for a cast aluminum workpiece in a real industrial setting.

tion to avoid costly online modifications or design changes. They propose a parametric DT model to enhance implementation feasibility, facilitate iter -
ative refinement between digital and physical systems, and reduce online work by improving twin closeness. A case study demonstrates the appli -
cation of this model in a real-world scenario. The study involves grinding and polishing cast aluminum parts, using a digital twin to simulate the entire manufacturing process. This approach reveals potential issues like collisions and joint limit violations, allowing for layout optimization and parameter calibration. The calibrated DT model then generates an accu-rate tool path for the robot controller, minimizing online adjustments and significantly simplifying the engineering process. They conclude that while DTs are crucial, the field still lacks comprehensive frameworks and appli-cation references. Future work will focus on automating online tasks and clarifying twin closeness, enhancing the DT model’s efficiency throughout a system’s life cycle [3].
Sensor Integration
The integration of sensors and IoT devices played a crucial role in the evo -
lution of digital twins. Sensors enabled the collection of real-time data from physical assets, providing a continuous stream of information about their performance, condition, and environment. This data integration allowed for dynamic updates and monitoring of the digital twin, providing a more accurate representation of the physical asset.
