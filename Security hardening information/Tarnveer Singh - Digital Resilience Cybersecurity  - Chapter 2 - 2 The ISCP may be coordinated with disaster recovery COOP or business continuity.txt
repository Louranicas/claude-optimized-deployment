Information system: An information system is a set of resources for collecting, processing, maintaining, using, sharing, or disposing of information. Components include mainframes, servers, workstations, network components, operating systems, middleware, and applications. Network components can include firewalls, sensors, switches, routers, gateways, wireless access points, and network appliances. Servers can include database servers, authentication servers, email and web servers, proxy servers, domain name servers, and network time servers. Components can be commercially off-the-shelf or custom-developed and deployed in land-based, sea-based, airborne, and/or space-based systems.
Information systems face disruptions, from mild (e.g., power outage) to severe (e.g., fire). Vulnerabilities can be reduced through management, operational, or technical controls, but not all risks can be eliminated. Contingency planning mitigates system and service unavailability by enhancing system availability.
We must consider how federal information system contingency planning fits into risk management, security, and emergency preparedness programmes. It also covers other emergency preparedness plans and their relationship to information system contingency planning. Finally, it explains how integrating contingency planning throughout the SDLC promotes system compatibility and cost-effective responses to disruptions.
Contingency planning and resilience: Organisations must withstand hazards and sustain missions through environmental changes, whether gradual or sudden. Building a resilient infrastructure minimises disruption impacts on essential functions.
Resilience is the ability to adapt and recover from environmental changes. It is an end-state where organisations continue essential functions during disruptions. Resilient organisations adapt to changes and risks affecting critical functions. Risk management, contingency, and continuity planning are security and emergency management activities that can be implemented holistically as part of a resiliency programme.
Effective contingency planning starts with a policy and a business impact analysis (BIA) for each system. This prioritises systems and processes based on FIPS 199 impact levels and develops recovery strategies. FIPS 199 examines three security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Confidentiality protects information access and disclosure. Integrity guards against improper modification or destruction. Availability ensures timely and reliable information access.
Impact levels for each objective are high, moderate, or low, as defined in FIPS 199.
The highest individual security objective impact levels determine the overall system security impact level.
Contingency planning addresses the availability impact level of information systems. High-impact systems should consider high-availability and redundancy options, such as fully redundant load-balanced systems, data mirroring, and off-site database replication. These options are costly and should be reserved for high-impact systems. Lower-impact systems can use less expensive options and tolerate longer downtimes.
Effective contingency planning includes early incorporation and ongoing maintenance of security controls. NIST SP 800–53, Rev. 3, identifies nine contingency planning (CP) security controls. Not all controls apply to all systems. FIPS 199 categorisation determines applicable controls. For instance, low-impact systems do not need alternative sites, while moderate-impact systems require only basic backup controls. FIPS 199 allows tailoring of CP controls in NIST SP 800–53 to appropriate baselines.
Several CP controls reference environmental controls from the NIST SP 800–53 Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) family. These controls pertain to the location housing the system, including hardware and technology assets. Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800–53 offers more on environmental controls.
Organisations can use compensating security controls to meet CP control intents. These controls must provide comparable protection and have justified use.
Finkenstadt et al. (2024) go beyond this to argue businesses are increasingly leveraging strategic foresight and scenario planning to prevent disruptions. Generative AI can be used to provide rapid, cost-effective, and comprehensive contingency planning. This AI-driven approach enhances decision-making and provides effective risk reduction.2
Disaster Recovery
The ability to maintain operations and minimise disruptions is critical for success. Unexpected events such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, or supply chain disruptions can have devastating consequences for organisations, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and even the potential for business failure.
Noor (2024) argues this is where business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) planning come into play, serving as essential strategies for mitigating risks and ensuring resilience in the face of adversity. Noor provides guidance on the formation of the BC and DR plans and setting the recovery time objectives.3
Sehra and Singh (2024) argue that at the core of an effective disaster recovery plan lies the selection of reliable suppliers who can support your organisation’s ability to recover quickly and efficiently.4 Nanda et al. (2024) contend that these suppliers play a crucial role in providing the necessary resources, services, and expertise to maintain business continuity during times of crisis. By carefully evaluating and choosing the right suppliers, you can significantly enhance your organisation’s preparedness and increase its chances of weathering the storm.5
Reliable suppliers are the backbone of a robust disaster recovery plan. They provide the vital resources, services, and expertise necessary to maintain business operations during and after a disruptive event. Without reliable suppliers, organisations may find themselves ill-equipped to respond effectively, leading to prolonged downtime, lost revenue, and potentially irreparable damage to their reputation.
Furthermore, reliable suppliers can offer invaluable guidance and support throughout the disaster recovery process. They possess the specialised knowledge and experience to navigate complex situations, ensuring that your organisation can quickly adapt and respond to evolving circumstances.
