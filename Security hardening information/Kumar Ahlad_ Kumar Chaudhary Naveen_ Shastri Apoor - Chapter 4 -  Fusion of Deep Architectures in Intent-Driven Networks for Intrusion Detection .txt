# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Kumar, Ahlad_ Kumar Chaudhary, Naveen_ Shastri, Apoorva S._ Sing - Digital Defence_ Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (2025, CRC Press) - libgen.li
Chapter: 4 - , “Fusion of Deep Architectures in Intent-Driven Networks for Intrusion Detection” explores the cutting-edge integration of AI into Intent-Based Networking (IBN), a modern approach to network management designed to fulfill specific business objectives. This chapter delves into how IBN differs from traditional network management by ensuring networks operate reliably and efficiently, adhering to business policies and intent. It further examines the potential of leveraging AI—specifically machine learning and deep learning—to enhance security and manage network intrusions within these intent-driven environments. This chapter highlights the use of advanced AI models, including Random Forest Classifiers, ID-convolutional neural networks, and hybrid architectures combining convolutional layers with Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to detect and respond to security breaches. By presenting results from models trained on both imbalanced and balanced datasets, this chapter offers insight into how deep learning architectures can be utilized to create smarter, more secure networks. Through this fusion of AI and IBN, this chapter demonstrates the effectiveness of using deep architectures to improve intrusion detection, thereby laying the groundwork for more secure and adaptive business networks.
