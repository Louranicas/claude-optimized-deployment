The purposes of hacktivism are:

Avoiding government censorship by aiding individuals in bypassing national firewalls or facilitating online organizations for demonstrators.
Utilizing social media platforms to advocate for human rights and aiding oppressed populations under dictatorial regimes in communicating with the outside world.
Disabling government websites that pose threats to politically active individuals.
Upholding online freedom of expression and enhancing access to information.
Supporting civilian uprisings and defending democratic principles.
Assisting users in protecting their privacy and avoiding surveillance by utilizing private and anonymous networks like Tor and the Signal messaging app.
Challenging corporate or government authority.
Providing assistance to illegal immigrants in safely crossing borders.
Participating in demonstrations against globalization and capitalism.
Protesting war crimes and combatting terrorism financing.


Figure 2.2: Hacktivism
Hacktivists can execute attacks through various methods:

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack involves overloading systems and causing a website to crash. Similarly, individuals resort to civil disobedience, such as staging a sit-in, to draw attention to an issue. During such protests, businesses often suspend operations as dozens or hundreds of people occupy areas where these businesses operate. This forces organizations to halt activities, garnering attention from the public. Similarly, hacktivists employ a comparable tactic with Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. While they do not modify website content, they overload it with requests, congesting the server and making it unresponsive to regular users.
Doxing is short for dropping documents. It is typically carried out as a malicious act against individuals whom the hacker disagrees with or opposes. Doxing involves the release of personal information about an organization or individual, including their real name, home address, workplace, phone number, bank details, and other private information. This information is then publicly disclosed without the victim’s consent. This data is sensitive and may be used in extortion attempts.
Bloggers frequently have the ability to convincingly convey truths and make impactful societal statements, even without disclosing their real identities. Their anonymity shields them from retaliation, rendering them inaccessible to their targets. This strategy is commonly employed by activists, whistleblowers, and journalists, providing a platform for them to address issues like human rights abuses or oppressive governmental regimes while safeguarding their anonymity.

Website defacement is a form of attack wherein unauthorized individuals gain access to a website and modify its content with their own material. These alterations often involve political or religious messages or other objectionable content intended to embarrass the website owners. Additionally, it may include a notice indicating that a particular hacker group has successfully breached the website’s security. Retaliation, rendering them inaccessible to their targets. This strategy is commonly employed by activists, whistleblowers, and journalists, providing a platform for them to address issues like human rights abuses or oppressive governmental regimes while safeguarding their anonymity.
This technique enables Internet users to attach a geotag to YouTube videos, revealing the video’s location on platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps. Geo-bombing occurs when a hacktivist utilizes the geolocation feature to disclose the filming location of a video. This is often utilized to indicate where political prisoners or human rights activists are being held captive.

RECAP is software designed to provide users with access to documents from the United States Federal Court that would typically incur a fee. The database utilized by federal courts in the United States is known as Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER). Hacktivists offer a free service while eliminating a barrier they believe should not exist in the first place.
Website replication involves duplicating a legitimate website. In cases where a website is censored, hackers might replicate the site’s content and publish it under a new Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The hacktivist duplicates the content and links it to a new URL on a mirror site, ensuring continued accessibility to the content. This practice is aimed at promoting freedom of information.
Information leaks are a prevalent activist strategy wherein an insider source obtains access to sensitive or classified material that exposes misconduct by an individual, company, or government agency and discloses it to the public. Hacktivists release such data not only to challenge organizations or individuals conflicting with their principles but also to gain publicity. When credible information is disclosed, news outlets are inclined to disseminate it widely. When a hacktivist movement or group, such as Wikileaks, is prominently featured in headlines, it may even gain authority, visibility, and recognition.
Types of hacking
Types of hacking consist of a spectrum ranging from ethical practices like penetration testing to malicious activities such as phishing and ransomware attacks. These techniques vary in their objectives, methodologies, and ethical considerations. Different types of hacking are:

Phishing involves deceiving users into revealing crucial information like passwords or credit card details by impersonating reputable companies or individuals. Malicious actors utilize tactics to trick users into clicking on harmful links, potentially leading to virus installation or other forms of cyber attacks.
Clickjacking, also termed as UI redress attack, involves deceiving a user into clicking on a button or link on a different page than intended by overlaying multiple transparent or opaque layers. By doing so, the attacker reroutes the user’s clicks meant for their page to another page, typically owned by a different application or domain. Similarly, keystrokes can be intercepted using a similar technique, where users may unknowingly input sensitive information into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker, believing they are entering data into a legitimate webpage.
Malware, short for malicious software, refers to harmful programs that users install accidentally. It poses threats to computer systems, networks, or applications, often resulting in system crashes. Examples of malware include spyware, Trojan horses, viruses, worms, and ransomware.
Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is an attack method where an attacker injects SQL code into an application, enabling them to access or manipulate data within a computer system. This malicious code grants the attacker the ability to execute SQL statements within the system, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as customer data, intellectual property (IP), and other confidential data.
Session hijacking, also known as TCP hijacking, involves attackers stealing a web user’s active session by obtaining their unique session ID. This enables them to impersonate the user, accessing data or performing actions as if they were the legitimate user. Such breaches disrupt sessions and pose significant risks to both personal and organizational data security. In a session hijacking attack, malicious actors gain access to a server without authentication. Once the session is hijacked, the attacker no longer needs authentication as long as the session remains active. This provides the attacker with a level of server access equivalent to that of the compromised user, who had previously undergone server authentication before the attack occurred.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a flaw in a web application that enables a third party to execute a script in the user’s browser on behalf of the web application. It stands as one of the most widespread vulnerabilities on the web. Exploiting XSS against a user can result in various adverse outcomes, including compromised accounts, account deletion, privilege escalation, malware infections, and more.

Types of hackers
The primary classification of hackers is based on their motivations and activities, dividing them into six categories: white hat, black hat, gray hat, red hat, green hat, and blue hat hackers, as illustrated in Figure 2.
