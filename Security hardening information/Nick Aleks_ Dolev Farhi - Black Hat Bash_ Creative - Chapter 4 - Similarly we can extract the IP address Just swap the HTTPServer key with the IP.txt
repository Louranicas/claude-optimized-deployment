Similarly, we can extract the IP address. Just swap the HTTPServer key with the IP key:
$ whatweb 172.16.10.10:8081 --log-json=/dev/stdout --quiet | jq '.[0].plugins.IP.string[0]'

"172.16.10.10"

Go ahead and run WhatWeb against every web server we’ve identified to see the technologies they run.



Summary
In this chapter, we put bash to use in many ways. We created dynamic target host lists; used multiple tools to perform host discovery, port scanning, and banner grabbing; created an automated script to notify us of newly discovered hosts; and parsed various tool results. In the next chapter, we’ll run vulnerability scanners and fuzzers against these targets.
