# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Kumar, Ahlad_ Kumar Chaudhary, Naveen_ Shastri, Apoorva S._ Sing - Digital Defence_ Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (2025, CRC Press) - libgen.li
Chapter: 10 - , “Insight into How Legal and Ethical Considerations Improve Artificial Intelligence Capabilities to Enhance the Performance of Cyber Forensic Accounting,” illustrates the intricate relationship between legal and ethical considerations (LEC) and the performance of cyber forensic accounting (PCFA). This chapter investigates how artificial intelligence capabilities (AIC) mediate this relationship, using a proposed model supported by structural equation modeling and validated through statistical data from surveys conducted with accountants in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The analysis confirms significant interconnections between LEC, AIC, and PCFA, demonstrating how thoughtful legal and ethical frameworks can enhance the performance of AI in forensic accounting. By providing nuanced insights into these dynamics, this chapter not only offers a foundation for further research but also serves as a practical guide for practitioners and policymakers. It highlights how effective rules and policies regarding AI management can optimize cyber forensic accounting practices, ultimately leading to more robust and reliable financial investigations.
