Chapter: 789 - To address this trade-off, password managers can be used to store and manage complex passwords securely.
Mixed passwords are a subtype of complex passwords created using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. This focus on complexity strengthens their security against hacking attempts, making them akin to high-security locks with multiple tumblers. However, memorability is sacrificed for this enhanced security. Examples include @ali#789. To manage this trade-off, password managers can be employed for secure storage and retrieval of complex passwords.
Pattern passwords, an alternative unlock method offered by Android phones, utilize a 3x3 grid of dots. A specific path must be created by users by connecting these dots in the correct sequence to unlock the device. Unlike traditional password methods that rely on memorizing a combination of letters and numbers, pattern passwords leverage a visual memory component. However, as with other password types, the security of a pattern password increases with its complexity. Simpler patterns, such as connecting neighboring dots in a straight line, are more susceptible to being guessed compared to intricate patterns that weave across the grid.
Fingerprint authentication represents a significant shift from conventional password methods. Unlike memorizing a combination of letters or numbers, this approach utilizes the unique characteristics of a user's fingerprint for secure access. The user simply needs to place their finger on a designated scanning sensor on the device, eliminating the need to recall complex passwords. This biometric authentication method offers a convenient and secure alternative to traditional password-based logins.
Face lock passwords allow for device unlocking through facial recognition. When a user positions their phone in front of their face, the camera captures their image and verifies it against stored data. Upon successful recognition, the phone unlocks automatically, eliminating the need for manual password input. This method offers a convenient and hands-free approach to device security.

Types of password attacks and measures of prevention
One of the most prevalent challenges in the modern age is password attacks. The most common reason for hacking-related data breaches is overused, weak, or stolen passwords, which are also a tried-and-true way for hackers to access the IT resources of the company. Password attacks occur through various techniques and practices to reduce enterprise risk. Some of the prevalent password attacks shown in Figure 8.1 are as follows:

Figure 8.1: Types of password attack

Brute-force attacks: A brute-force attack is a password attack where hackers conduct many hit-or-miss efforts to acquire access. It uses automated techniques, including software, for trying out possible letter-number combinations. Attackers must look for efficiency because it takes time to use a large number of options. Simple options, like short or common passwords, are frequently used to begin generating a list of possible combinations. The attackers will also apply the criteria if they are aware of the password requirements for a particular provider, such as the minimum number of characters that are permitted.
Complex passwords are recommended to help resist brute-force attacks. A six-digit password that is all lowercase and all alphabetic can be much less effective in a brute-force attack than a ten-digit password that is a combination of case and character. An access control tool like OneLogin can reduce the risk of such assaults. Thus, allowing and configuring remote access is advisable after consulting the IT department to determine if the organization utilizes it. Furthermore, multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enforced since enabling MFA guarantees that an attempted hacker can only seek access to the account via the second factor; if the hacker cannot obtain access to the fingerprint or mobile device, they would be locked out.

Phishing: Phishing occurs when a fraudulent email is sent by a hacker posing as a trustworthy party, with the hope that personal information will be revealed voluntarily. At times, recipients are led to fake reset your password screens, while other times, links in the email install malicious code on the device.
To avoid phishing attacks, the sender of the email should be checked by looking at the From: Line to ensure the claimed identity matches the expected email address. If there is any doubt, the supposed sender should be contacted to confirm they were the actual sender. Additionally, the IT team should be consulted, as they can often determine if the received email is legitimate.

Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: These attacks occur when a hacker or compromised system intercepts communication between two uncompromised parties, deciphering the information being exchanged, including passwords. In carrying out a MitM password attack, the hacker typically acts as a proxy to disguise the interception of data.
To help prevent MitM attacks, encryption should be enabled on the router, as an accessible modem and router can be exploited by anyone using sniffer technology to view the transmitted information. Strong credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) should be used, as many router credentials remain unchanged from the default settings; if a hacker gains access to router administration, all traffic can be redirected to their compromised servers. Additionally, a virtual private network (VPN) should be used, as a secure VPN ensures that all servers receiving data are trusted, thus helping to prevent MitM attacks.

Dictionary attacks: Dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks are similar, yet they differ significantly. Conventional brute-force attacks try to break a password character by character, but dictionary assaults search through a list of frequently used terms and phrases. Dictionary attacks often use variants of frequently used terms, while more sophisticated assaults employ user-specific information that can be easily retrieved from the Internet. One can quickly find out the name of a worker's pet from their Instagram account.
Several precautions should be taken in order to prevent dictionary attacks. Dictionary terms are never appropriate for passwords; a word that appears in a book should not be used as a password. If it is necessary to use a password rather than an access management tool, a password management system should be considered. In addition, accounts should be locked after an excessive number of unsuccessful password attempts. Although it may cause inconvenience to be temporarily deprived of access to an account because of a forgotten password, this action greatly strengthens account security. Furthermore, users should think about getting a password manager since these tools create strong passwords on their own, preventing dictionary attacks.

Credential stuffing: It is a method that takes advantage of accounts that never had their passwords changed after an account break-in. Various combinations of former usernames and passwords are tried by hackers, with the hope that the victim never changed them. If a hack has been experienced in the past, it is known that old passwords were likely leaked onto a disreputable website.
To help prevent credential stuffing, several measures can be taken. Monitoring of accounts is recommended. Regularly changing passwords is advisable, the longer a password remains unchanged, the greater the likelihood that a hacker will find a way to crack it. Additionally, the use of a password manager is suggested, similar to preventing a dictionary attack, many credential stuffing attacks can be averted by employing a strong and secure password, and a password manager aids in maintaining them.

Keylogger attack: Keyloggers operate by spying on their victims and recording their keystrokes, capturing not only passwords but also all other text input. This includes usernames, credit card details, security question answers, and sensitive information like social security numbers. Keyloggers commonly function as a type of spyware, infecting a victim’s device with malware. While physical device keyloggers exist, software keyloggers are more prevalent. To infiltrate a victim’s device, attackers typically employ methods such as phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, or Trojans. Once keyloggers have infiltrated a system, they are exceedingly difficult to detect, emphasizing the importance of prevention as the best defense, particularly in this scenario.
To protect from keyloggers, several measures can be taken. Regular checks of physical hardware are advised; if someone gains access to your workstation, they can install a hardware keylogger to collect keystroke information. Therefore, it is recommended to regularly inspect your computer and the surrounding area to ensure awareness of each piece of hardware. Additionally, running a virus scan is essential; reputable antivirus software should be utilized to scan your computer regularly. Antivirus companies maintain records of the most common malware keyloggers and will flag them as dangerous during scans.

Rainbow table attacks: A rainbow table attack constitutes a form of password attack wherein the attacker pre-computes the hashes of numerous common passwords and stores them in a table. Upon obtaining access to a hashed password, the attacker can swiftly ascertain the original password by comparing the hash to the pre-computed hashes in the table.
To fortify defenses against rainbow table attacks, employing strong and unique passwords is imperative. Additionally, it is crucial to utilize a hashing algorithm that is resistant to such attacks. Furthermore, employing salting techniques, which involve appending a random value to each password before hashing, can significantly enhance security by thwarting the effectiveness of rainbow tables. Regularly updating passwords and utilizing multifactor authentication mechanisms also serve as effective deterrents against rainbow table attacks. Lastly, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of stored password hashes by implementing robust access controls and encryption mechanisms further bolsters defenses against such malicious exploits.

Social engineering attacks: Social engineering encompasses a form of password theft where the victim is manipulated into disclosing their password. This can occur through various means, including phishing attacks as described previously, or by impersonating a legitimate authority figure and soliciting the victim's password.
Prevention of social engineering entails the implementation of robust security measures. Strong passwords should be utilized, alongside encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive data. Educating users on security best practices is vital, fostering awareness of potential threats and instilling caution in interactions online. Furthermore, the establishment of MFA adds an additional layer of security, requiring multiple forms of verification for access. Regular monitoring of networks for suspicious activity aids in the detection and mitigation of social engineering attempts. Additionally, fostering a culture of security consciousness within organizations and promoting a healthy skepticism towards unsolicited requests for sensitive information contribute to effective prevention strategies against social engineering attacks.
Internet of Things security
IoT has introduced new security challenges. Unlike traditional devices, many IoT devices lack built-in security features and operate under the radar of conventional cybersecurity systems. Furthermore, they often transmit data unencrypted, making them prime targets for attackers.
IoT security involves a comprehensive strategy to safeguard connected devices and the networks they inhabit. Since security was not prioritized during the design phase of many IoT devices, robust protections are essential to prevent data breaches and network compromise. The ever-growing number and variety of these devices, coupled with the expanding communication channels they utilize, create a constantly evolving attack landscape for businesses. Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain remote access to devices, steal sensitive data through various methods like credential theft, or control software weaknesses for malicious purposes. Some of the IoT risks illustrated in Figure 8.2 are:

Weak authentication: Deficient authentication mechanisms pose a significant vulnerability in IoT security. Many devices either lack robust authentication altogether or rely on weak default passwords that are susceptible to brute-force attacks or public discovery. Even if an individual device stores minimal sensitive data, a compromised system can act as a gateway, granting attackers access to the broader network. Furthermore, compromised devices can be incorporated into botnets, leveraging their processing power for malicious activities such as malware distribution or launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. To mitigate these risks, manufacturers should prioritize robust authentication practices. This includes implementing MFA protocols, employing strong, unique default passwords that require mandatory changes upon initial setup, and enforcing guidelines that encourage users to create secure passwords:


Figure 8.2: IoT security challenges

Low processing power: While minimizing power consumption is crucial for extending battery life and keeping costs low in IoT devices, this focus on efficiency often comes at the expense of robust security features. The limited processing power of these devices makes them ill-equipped to handle complex security measures like firewalls, virus scanners, and end-to-end encryption. This inherent vulnerability leaves them wide open to hacking attempts. To compensate for this limitation, a layered security approach is necessary. The devices themselves can implement basic security measures within their capabilities. By implementing strong security features at the network level, such as robust firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure communication protocols, the network can act as a powerful security shield, protecting even the most resource-constrained IoT devices from malicious actors.
Legacy assets: Legacy assets, those applications and systems not originally designed for the cloud, pose a significant challenge in securing modern IT environments. Built-in an era before widespread cyber threats, these systems often lack the robust security features needed to combat today's sophisticated attacks. For example, older systems might be incompatible with newer, more secure encryption standards, rendering sensitive data vulnerable if intercepted. The very act of making these outdated applications Internet-enabled introduces inherent risks. Patching vulnerabilities or implementing stricter access controls may seem like straightforward solutions, but the reality with legacy assets is far more complex.
Shared network access: It is more convenient for IoT devices to share the same network as the user's other devices, like their Wi-Fi or local area network (LAN). However, this convenience also increases the entire network's vulnerability. A compromised IoT device can be used to access sensitive data stored on the network or other connected devices. Similarly, another device on the network could be exploited to hack the IoT device. In these cases, customers and manufacturers often blame each other. To mitigate risks, every IoT application should ideally use a separate network or have a dedicated security gateway or firewall to contain any security breaches to the device itself. A VPN can offer protection from external threats, but if the application shares a connection with other devices, it remains susceptible to attacks from those devices if they become compromised.
Inconsistent security standards: Due to the lack of a single, industry-wide standard, security standards within IoT are uneven. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication must be enabled while limiting danger, which requires businesses and specialized markets to create standards and norms.
Absence of encryption: Regular transmissions without encryption pose a serious risk to the security of the IoT. Since many IoT devices communicate data without encrypting it, credentials and other sensitive data sent to and from the device may be intercepted in the event that the network is breached.
Absence of firmware updates: Devices that have faults that lead to vulnerabilities when they are deployed pose a serious risk to IoT security. Manufacturers need to be able to release firmware upgrades to remove risks, regardless of whether the vulnerabilities originate from developed code or a third party. Updates should ideally be performed remotely, however this is not always possible. Physical access to the device may be required to send updates if a network has restricted message capabilities or too poor data transfer rates.
Disparities between cloud storage and mobile networks: Numerous IoT devices communicate with cloud-based apps on a regular basis. Even while an IoT device's cellular network and cloud application might be safe, data transfers from the network to the cloud usually go via the public Internet, making them susceptible to malware and interception. A single, little hole can jeopardize an IoT deployment as a whole. Cloud-based connectivity solutions from IoT manufacturers and their clients can help close these gaps.
Restricted device management: It is common for businesses to be blind to the fact that a device has been compromised and turned off. Every mobile network operator (MNO) offers a platform for managing connectivity; some are really basic and do not provide much information. Users ought to be able to identify unusual activity on hacked or hijacked devices and remotely deactivate them before they cause more damage, since these devices typically consume data in different ways.
Physical vulnerabilities: Unauthorized access is possible since some IoT devices are in constant touch with people and do not operate in secluded regions. on the context of fleet management, for instance, drivers might pilfer Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards for free data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers on their cars. For identity theft, other criminals might take SIM cards. IoT device physical access can potentially be utilized for malicious activities, such information theft or network access.

End users cannot constantly monitor their IoT devices to ensure they are not being physically accessed. Thus, it is essential to consider ways to harden devices with better components and security features.
The safety and effectiveness of networks and linked devices are greatly increased by implementing strong IoT security, resulting in several benefits. Some of the key benefits shown in Figure 8.3 are:

Enhanced data protection: Sensitive data transmitted and stored by IoT devices is shielded from breaches and unwanted access thanks to IoT security. This is accomplished by lowering the possibility of data theft and guaranteeing user privacy through strong encryption, safe authentication procedures, and frequent security updates.
Enhanced device reliability: IoT devices that have robust security measures in place are less vulnerable to cyberattacks that could interfere with their operation. Secure devices perform consistently and dependablely, increasing their operational reliability. This is important for applications in vital industries including manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare.
Preventing unwanted access: MFA and access control are two IoT security features that aid in preventing unwanted users from accessing IoT networks and devices. As a result, there is a lower chance of hostile activity such data alteration, eavesdropping, and unapproved device control.
Defense against botnets: Robust IoT security helps keep devices from being hijacked and incorporated into botnets. Large-scale DDoS assaults, which can disrupt services and seriously harm infrastructures and organizations, can be launched by attackers using botnets.
Regulation compliance: Implementing IoT security helps organizations comply with industry regulations and standards that mandate the protection of personal and sensitive data. This compliance avoids legal penalties and builds trust with customers and stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to data security.
Enhanced network safety: Protect The general security of the network is enhanced by IoT devices. The integrity and security of the entire network can be enhanced by reducing vulnerabilities and making sure that IoT devices do not serve as entry points for cyberattacks, safeguarding data and other connected systems.

Social media security
Social media security refers to the methods and measures that companies and individuals use to protect the information, privacy, and confidentiality of their social media accounts. This entails controlling third-party apps and permissions, employing account authentication, monitoring privacy settings, being alert to phishing schemes, and upholding safe browsing practices. Data protection for businesses and individuals while reducing risks becomes more crucial as social media platforms gain in popularity and interconnection. Ensuring user data, privacy, and accounts on multiple social networking sites requires the development of policies and procedures for effective social media security. This defence guards against identity theft, malware, phishing attacks, illegal access, online harassment, and data breaches. Users can ensure a safer online experience and considerably reduce their susceptibility to cyberattacks by putting in place the necessary security measures. By securing private data, blocking illegal access, and guarding against identity theft, fraud, and online abuse, social media security is essential for maintaining individual privacy.
Restricting access to trusted individuals ensures a higher level of privacy. Furthermore, it enhances online reputation management, allowing individuals to control their online presence better and protect against reputational damage from inappropriate content or harassment. This creates a safer and more enjoyable online experience by minimizing interactions with cyberbullies.
Social media security is crucial for businesses to safeguard confidential company information, such as intellectual property, against illegal access and data breaches. Businesses relying mostly on social media for marketing and information sharing must have this protection. Furthermore, by regularly monitoring and responding to security threats, decreasing the possibility of unauthorized account access, and safeguarding priceless assets, strong social media security helps minimize hazards to a brand's reputation. Businesses can protect themselves from legal and financial repercussions and retain a respectable market position by putting security first. By adhering to data protection standards, they can also build customer trust and credibility. Some of the common online social networks are depicted in Figure 8.4:

Figure 8.4: Popular online social networks
Understanding the most common social media security risks is essential for protecting your personal and business information online. The most common social media security risks depicted in Figure 8.5 are:

Phishing scams
Impersonation accounts
Malware infections and hacking
Insecure third-party applications
Password theft
Data security and privacy settings
Unprotected mobile devices

The most common social media security risks are explained in detail as follows:

Phishing scams: Phishing scams are among the most prevalent cybersecurity risks on social media. In a phishing scam, the objective is to deceive individuals or employees into revealing passwords, banking details, or other sensitive information. One common method involves fake coupons for well-known brands, especially prevalent on Facebook. To claim the coupon, users must provide personal information such as their address and birth date.
Account impersonation: It is comparatively simple for an attacker to set up a social media profile that resembles the appearance of an enterprise. This is one of the main benefits of social network verification. Customers, staff, or prospective employees are all possible targets for imposter accounts. The company's reputation takes a hit when contacts are tricked into disclosing private information. Additionally, imposter accounts have the potential to fool staff members into divulging login passwords for company systems.
Another form of impostor fraud involves companies looking to collaborate with influencers. In this con, someone poses as a well-known social media influencer and contacts them to ask for a free product. Verification is essential to guaranteeing authenticity when partnering with real influencers, but doing so also delivers marketing benefits.

Malware infections and hacking: Social media platforms can be used by malicious links or infected files to propagate malware and viruses, endangering the security of networks and devices. Financial losses, unwanted access to private data, and extended recovery times are all possible outcomes of these attacks. Social media users must be careful about the items and links they download. Security software should be updated often to reduce these dangers, and staff members should be trained about potential vulnerabilities.
Insecure third-party applications: Although locking down your social media accounts is an excellent precaution; hackers can still access your accounts by finding security holes in related third-party apps. Instagram particularly alerts users to be wary of third-party apps that promise to provide them with followers or likes. The account can be fully accessed if login credentials are provided to these apps, either by supplying a username and password or by using an access token. Viewing private messages, finding out about friends, and posting spam or other dangerous content on the profile are all possible.
Password theft: Engaging in various social media quizzes might appear harmless and entertaining at first glance. However, online social media challenges and quizzes frequently serve as a means to collect password information or obtain personal details, often used as forgotten password clues. Participating in these quizzes can inadvertently pose security risks for employees. While the quizzes may seem innocuous, they can potentially expose sensitive information, making individuals vulnerable to identity theft, phishing attacks, or unauthorized access to accounts. Consequently, individuals must exercise caution and refrain from sharing personal details or answering security-related questions in these seemingly harmless online activities.
Data security and privacy settings: People widely acknowledge the potential privacy risks of using social media. Trust in social networks' capacity to safeguard privacy and data has steadily declined in recent years. Governments worldwide have restricted access to the TikTok platform on official equipment due to concerns regarding data security. This decline in trust can be attributed to various factors, including frequent data breaches, controversies surrounding data misuse by social media companies, and increasing awareness among users regarding exploiting their personal information for targeted advertising and other purposes. TikTok's prominence in recent debates over data security stems from allegations that the platform collects extensive user data, including potentially sensitive information, and shares it with the Chinese government. Such concerns have prompted governments to take precautionary measures, such as banning or restricting access to TikTok on official devices, to diminish potential risks associated with data security and privacy breaches.
Unprotected mobile devices: More than half of all Internet time is spent using mobile devices. With a single tap, social media accounts may be easily accessed using social media apps. The ease is great as long as the phone is in the owner's hands, but if a phone—including an employee's—is misplaced or stolen, the one-tap access function makes it very easy for a thief to access social media accounts. They can also send phishing or malware attacks to the owner's connections or post on the account afterward. Unexpectedly, many smartphone users still leave their phones unlocked, even though securing the device with a password, fingerprint, or facial verification adds a layer of security.
With the increasing number of cyber threats, ensuring the safety of online presence is crucial. Here are some essential guidelines to keep social media accounts secure:

Figure 8.5: Essential guidelines for the safety of social media accounts

Strong passwords: Establishing a robust password serves as the primary safeguard against cyberattacks. Using numerals, special characters, and a mix of capital and lowercase letters should be considered. Date of birth and pet name are easily guessed information that should be avoided. Update passwords frequently, and never use the same one for multiple accounts.
Enable two-factor authentication: An extra layer of security can be added to social media accounts with 2FA. This feature requires a second form of verification, such as a unique code sent to phone, to be provided in addition to your password.
Be mindful of what is shared: Personal information should be carefully considered before being shared on social media. Cybercriminals can use that information to impersonate a person or even steal their identity. Caution should be exercised when sharing the address, phone number, or details about the daily routine.
Stay updated: Regular updates should be applied to your social media apps and devices to ensure the latest security patches are in place. Developers frequently release updates to fix vulnerabilities and enhance security features, so keeping everything up-to-date should be a regular habit.
Beware of phishing attempts: Vigilance should be maintained regarding suspicious emails or messages that request personal information or login credentials. Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, so the sender's email address should be double-checked, and clicking on suspicious links should be avoided.

Security and cryptocurrency
A cryptocurrency is an exclusively digital representation of value. It is processed and stored with computer, mobile, or application-specific software. Cryptocurrency transactions take place over the Internet or secure, specialized networks. They are mostly unregulated and are issued by private companies or development groups.
A digital payment method known as cryptocurrency depends on transaction verification independent of banks. Peer-to-peer technology, which allows anybody, anywhere, to send and receive money, verifies transactions. Digital entries in an online database that detail individual transactions are the sole means by which cryptocurrency payments are made instead of actual money that is carried and exchanged in the real world. Transactions involving Bitcoin funds are recorded into a public ledger. Crypto wallets are utilized to store cryptocurrency.
When encryption is used to validate transactions, cryptocurrency was developed. Data about Bitcoin is stored and sent between wallets and public ledgers using complex coding. Security and safety are the goals of encryption. Cryptocurrencies offer advantages such as faster transaction speeds, ease of use, and broad accessibility. However, they are vulnerable to hacking through the software used to access them and, being unregulated, generally provide no legal recourse for users if they fall victim to an attack.
Some of the best-known cryptocurrencies are:

Bitcoin: Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency founded in 2009 and is the most actively traded digital currency. Its creation is attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, an enigmatic pseudonym believed to represent either an individual or a collaborative group.
Ethereum: Ethereum functions as a blockchain platform with its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). It trails only Bitcoin in terms of popularity within the cryptocurrency market.
Litecoin: Exhibiting a close resemblance to Bitcoin, Litecoin prioritizes expedited innovation. This translates to faster transaction processing and payment mechanisms to handle a higher volume of transactions.
Ripple: Ripple is a distributed ledger system extending beyond the realm of cryptocurrency-specific transactions. The company behind Ripple has established partnerships with various prominent institutions within the financial sector.
Altcoins: This designation encompasses all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin, serving as a clear distinction from the first mover in this space.

Some of the most prominent cryptocurrency security risks shown in Figure 8.6 include:

Figure 8.6: Cryptocurrency risks

Crypto hacking: Crypto exchanges and wallets are often targeted by bad actors. Unauthorized access is gained, and crypto coins are stolen in a crypto hack. A common form of this attack involves hackers targeting crypto as it is transferred from one blockchain to another.
Wallet theft: Wallets, which are software applications that enable users to access, manage, and transfer crypto, are easy targets for cybercriminals when stored on unsecured mobile devices.
Social engineering via email phishing: Email phishing scams are commonly used to manipulate investors into revealing their private wallet keys. Users are tricked into downloading malware through these emails, allowing bad actors to gain control of devices, secretly monitor user activity, and steal crypto.
Crypto miners and 51 percent attacks: Crypto miners, who are volunteer coders, verify blockchain transactions to ensure the security and decentralization of cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of new coins. A 51 percent attack occurs when a group of miners controls more than half of a cryptocurrency’s mining power, enabling the group to manipulate the blockchain and double-spend coins.

To ensure the security of the cryptocurrency, some of the key practices are as follows:

Use a crypto wallet: Storing most crypto in a secure wallet provides protection from theft. A crypto wallet, either a software product or physical device, stores the keys to cryptocurrency accounts. Crypto wallets facilitate transfers between crypto types and transactions while protecting investments. Various types of cryptocurrency wallets are available, so researching the best option is advisable.
Enable 2FA for exchanges: When cryptocurrency is first purchased, it usually resides in an exchange account. If hackers gain access to this account, they can withdraw crypto to a wallet they control. Enabling 2FA for withdrawals in exchange apps can thwart these attacks. 2FA requires a code from a phone each time a withdrawal is made, enhancing security beyond just an email and password.
Regularly check crypto accounts: Regular monitoring of crypto accounts can help detect suspicious transactions and bots monitoring wallet activity. Staying updated with crypto news allows timely reporting of any losses due to breaches. Changing login credentials regularly enhances security.
Be wary of suspicious emails: Hackers often use social engineering, such as phishing emails, to access crypto accounts. Suspicious emails with slightly off addresses, odd spelling and grammar mistakes, and unexpected links or attachments should be avoided. Verification of any crypto websites or apps is essential to avoid scams.
Withdraw cryptocurrency from exchanges: Exchanges are attractive targets for scammers due to the large amounts of crypto stored. Risk exposure can be minimized by withdrawing cryptocurrency from the exchange to a personal wallet. Once transferred, attackers would need to compromise the personal device or steal the private key to access the crypto.
Use strong passwords: Strong passwords are difficult to crack. Using a mix of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters enhances security. Avoid using the same password on multiple platforms and change passwords periodically. A secure password manager can help manage complex passwords.
Avoid public Wi-Fi for crypto transactions: Public Wi-Fi should be avoided for sensitive transactions such as crypto trading due to the risk of nearby individuals intercepting Internet traffic and potentially viewing transactions.
Use secure Internet for crypto trading: Secure Internet usage involves more than avoiding public Wi-Fi. Setting up basic security infrastructure at home includes testing the firewall, ensuring anti-malware software is up to date, and securing the wireless router with a strong password. Network encryption and disabling network name broadcasting also enhance security.
Use a hardware wallet if possible: A hardware wallet, a USB device that stores key vaults, is one of the best ways to protect crypto. Hardware wallets have no Internet connection, making them difficult to infect with malware. Transactions require connecting the wallet to a PC or mobile device, and PIN codes provide additional security.
Check URLs to avoid fake crypto software: Scams involving fake wallets or applications can be avoided by downloading wallets only from the developer’s official website. Avoiding click-through advertisements and using direct links from official websites ensures authenticity.
Do Not enter seed words on websites: Seed words should only be entered during the initial installation of a wallet. Any request for seed words from a browser window should be treated with suspicion, and clearing the browser’s cache and reinstalling the wallet from a blank page is advised.
Use a good quality VPN: A VPN service can encrypt communications and hide online activities from potential intruders. VPNs help prevent MITM attacks, where hackers intercept and monitor data between a user and a website.

Security suit software
A security suite is an all-in-one cybersecurity solution that is equipped to defend against advanced threats with multi-layered protection, including network security, multi-device protection, and malware detection. Typically encompassing features such as antivirus, anti-malware protection, a firewall, and performance scanners, it is developed to meet the needs of today’s businesses. Both physical and cloud infrastructure environments can be protected by security suites, and they are managed through a single management tool. Furthermore, automatic updates ensure that your business is seamlessly protected against the latest cybersecurity threats.
While similar functions are served by security suites and the best antivirus software—helping to protect devices, networks, and businesses against cyberthreats—they are not identical. A business is shielded from viruses, worms, and malware by security suites, which routinely scan devices on the network to detect and eliminate potential threats. However, an antivirus is just one of a collection of tools in a security suite that work holistically to provide advanced protection. Other features, including access controls, firewalls, browser protection, and password managers, are also included.
Security suite software offers a variety of solutions to address cybersecurity threats:

Malware protection: Malicious software (malware) is detected and removed from computers. Notifications are provided at least monthly to ensure users are aware of up-to-date protection. Background scans are run with minimal performance impact during system startup.
Firewall security: Built-in firewalls secure private data by restricting access to safe sites only and preventing unauthorized access to the computer. In many cases, the suite's firewall works collaboratively with the existing firewall included in the operating system.
Multiuser protection: Unlike older anti-malware solutions that protect a single device, security suites can safeguard up to 10 systems with a single license.
Browsing security: Access to malicious websites or those designed to steal data is automatically blocked.
Bot scanning: Some suites include bot-scanning features to identify botnet activity. This helps prevent computers from becoming bots or suffering denial of service (DoS) attacks.
Online parental control: Certain suites offer parental control features that allow parents to set time limits for computer usage, monitor browsing activity, and even block access to inappropriate websites.
Spam protection: Spam filtering may be included to automatically detect and prevent spam emails from reaching inboxes.
VPN access: The most comprehensive security suites provide VPN services that encrypt your entire browsing session. This keeps your IP address and other personal information private.

Firewall
With the increasing number of cybercrimes, securing information has become essential for individuals and companies. However, many challenges are faced in implementing effective security measures. One such security device that can help safeguard networks and devices from outsiders is a firewall. A firewall is a network security device used to observe and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, adhering to the security policies defined by an organization. Essentially, it is used to act as a protective wall between a private internal network and the public Internet.
Just as fencing is used to protect a property and keep trespassers at bay, firewalls are used to secure computer networks. Unauthorized access to a network is prevented by firewalls, which are network security systems. They can be implemented as hardware or software units that filter incoming and outgoing traffic within a private network, according to a set of rules designed to spot and prevent cyberattacks. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or cloud-based. Cloud-based firewalls, referred to as firewall as a service (FWaaS), can be managed centrally and provide perimeter security.
The network traffic is analyzed by a firewall based on pre-configured rules, and the traffic is filtered according to these rules. Traffic generated from unreliable and suspicious sources is prohibited, and only traffic configured to be accepted according to firewall filter rules is permitted.
At the entry point, which is a port, traffic is intercepted by firewalls. Specific data packets are allowed or blocked based on pre-configured security rules. Incoming traffic is permitted only through trusted sources, such as trusted IP addresses or trusted source or a specific port.
Types of firewalls
Network firewalls are an indispensable component of any organization's cybersecurity strategy. Functioning as the initial line of defense, these critical security solutions scrutinize all data traversing the network. By implementing granular control over inbound and outbound traffic, firewalls effectively filter out malicious actors and their tools, such as malware and unauthorized access attempts, before they can infiltrate the system and compromise sensitive data or disrupt operations. Network firewalls come in various forms, each offering distinct levels of security. Firewalls are classified into the following groups (also depicted in Figure 8.7) according to their structure and functionality:
Packet filtering firewall
Packet filtering firewalls are among the oldest firewall architectures. Operating only at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model, the static packet filtering firewall does not differentiate between application protocols. Individual packets are accepted or denied based on an examination of fields in the packet's IP and protocol headers. Filtering of IP packets is done based on the source and destination IP address and source and destination port.
Several advantages are associated with this type of firewall. Headers are filtered in a fast and efficient manner, costs are kept low, and fewer resources are used. However, some limitations are present as well. Logging facilities are often lacking in packet filters, making them impractical for organizations with compliance and reporting requirements. Additionally, since only packet headers are examined, attackers can bypass the static packet filter using simple spoofing techniques, as the filter cannot distinguish between true and forged addresses.
Further limitations include difficulties in managing larger installations, as packet filtering rules are examined sequentially and must be carefully entered into the rule base. The static packet filter's inability to examine the entire packet allows attackers to hide malicious commands inside unexamined headers or within the payload itself. Finally, the lack of state-awareness in static packet filters necessitates the configuration of rules for both sides of the conversation by the administrator.
Static packet filtering firewalls are best suited for traffic isolation within departments, as shown in the following figure:

Figure 8.7: Types of firewalls
Circuit level gateways
A circuit level gateways act as semi-transparent bridges between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They operate at the session layer of the OSI model, overseeing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets on a virtual circuit between the two transport layers. The gateway monitors and validates each session, ensuring it is legitimate and authorized, while controlling the flow of traffic without inspecting the contents of each data packet.
Circuit-level gateways provide semi-transparent links between external networks that are untrusted and trustworthy inside networks. Operating at the session layer of the OSI model, they supervise packets on a virtual circuit that connects the two transport layers: TCP and UDP. Without opening each data packet to examine its contents, the gateway controls the traffic flow while keeping an eye on and verifying each session to ensure it is authentic and allowed.
Circuit level gateways provide a variety of advantages, such as higher network performance, easier configuration, affordability, little resource use, and more efficient network security. They reduce latency by processing connections rapidly and effectively at the session layer, eliminating the need for deep packet inspection. The configuration is simple, concentrating on the connections' current status and minimizing the intricacy of setting up specific rules. They are affordable for companies looking to properly safeguard their networks because of their less complicated nature, resulting in cheaper operating expenses. They also operate more efficiently and need less overhead because they do not require a different proxy server for every application, which makes managing network security easier.
Despite their benefits, circuit level gateways have several limitations, including limited inspection capabilities, frequent update requirements, insufficient data leakage protection, lack of traffic monitoring, and dependency on vendors for TCP/IP stack modifications. Malicious packets may pass through if they are part of an authorized session since they do not examine the contents of individual data packets. Regular updates are necessary to stay effective against evolving threats, which can be resource-intensive and demand significant IT staff attention. They also do not protect against data leakage from within the network, requiring additional security solutions to safeguard sensitive information. They fail to notice other signs of network problems or security breaches because of their limited focus on session handshakes. Lastly, their effectiveness is closely tied to proper TCP/IP stack configuration, often necessitating vendor intervention for updates and modifications.
Stateful inspection firewalls represent a significant advancement in network security compared to traditional stateless packet filtering. Unlike stateless firewalls that treat each data packet in isolation, stateful inspection firewalls employ a dynamic approach. They accurately track the characteristics of network connections, including source and destination IP addresses and port numbers. This comprehensive monitoring allows them to build and maintain a state table, essentially a log of every incoming and outgoing packet. By analyzing this state table, the firewall can determine if a packet belongs to an existing, authorized connection or represents a new request. If a packet does not align with an established connection, it undergoes rigorous evaluation against predefined security policies.
Stateful inspection firewalls elevate network security through a multi-layered approach. They analyze not only the packet header, like traditional firewalls, but also the data payload itself, enabling them to identify and block threats that would otherwise slip through. This in-depth examination extends beyond simple packet filtering, granting the ability to track active connections and ensure only authorized traffic matching established connections finds passage. Unfamiliar packets are held under scrutiny and evaluated against security policies. This dynamic adaptation to ever-evolving network traffic landscapes allows stateful inspection firewalls to provide real-time adjustments and safeguard enterprise networks against even the most complex and sophisticated attacks.
Stateful inspection firewalls come with several challenges, including configuration complexity, limitations in application layer defense, and the absence of user authentication. The meticulous configuration required to manage and maintain the state table can be time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating regular updates and reviews. Stateful inspection firewalls typically do not authenticate users, meaning they cannot verify the identity of individuals initiating network connections, which is crucial for robust security. This highlights the need for additional authentication mechanisms and web application firewalls to secure network access and protect against web-based threats.
Proxy firewalls
A proxy firewall acts as an application-level gateway, inspecting and filtering data exchanged between internal users and external resources. This intermediary function safeguards the network by enabling control over application traffic and effectively blocking malicious content.
A proxy firewall ensures that no direct connections are ever made with outside servers by evaluating and transferring data packets on behalf of users. Hiding internal network addresses improves security. To keep malicious content out of the network, the proxy firewall also enforces stringent guidelines regulating which applications can send data.
Proxy firewalls, which serve as an effective initial layer of defense by filtering application data to safeguard network resources, provide enhanced security. These firewalls mediate data transit, avoiding direct access from the outside and averting security lapses. Proxy firewalls also offer enhanced privacy. By hiding internal network information from the public Internet, they provide users anonymity while protecting their actions from outside dangers. The assessment of network traffic content facilitates advanced threat identification and helps reduce sophisticated cyber threats.

The assessment of network traffic content facilitates advanced threat identification and helps reduce sophisticated cyber threats.
While proxy firewalls offer robust security features, their deployment can introduce operational complexities for enterprise networks. The proxy architecture may introduce bottlenecks, potentially leading to degraded network performance and impacting user experience. Additionally, protocol limitations may restrict the functionality of certain applications within the network, hindering operational flexibility. Furthermore, the configuration and ongoing management of proxy firewalls necessitate specialized technical expertise. Improper configuration can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities, requiring careful attention. Additionally, caching data can expose sensitive information if not properly secured, highlighting the importance of ensuring end-to-end encryption and data integrity to prevent such risks.
Next generation firewalls
Next generation firewalls (NGFWs) represent a significant advancement over traditional stateful firewalls. While traditional firewalls provide basic stateful inspection of network traffic, NGFWs offer a comprehensive security solution. Key features of NGFWs include application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and continuous threat intelligence updates delivered from the cloud. This expanded functionality empowers NGFWs to provide a deeper understanding of network activity, allowing for granular control over application access and real-time threat identification and mitigation.
Compared to traditional firewalls, NGFWs deliver a comprehensive security upgrade. NGFWs leverage multi-layered protection by inspecting traffic at all levels of the OSI model (layers 2-7), providing organizations with superior network visibility. This enhanced analysis is coupled with integrated intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) for real-time threat identification and mitigation. Beyond basic packet filtering, NGFWs incorporate advanced features such as automatic updates for antivirus, anti-ransomware, and anti-spam protection, proactively safeguarding against evolving threats. They further analyze permitted applications for vulnerabilities, adding an extra layer of defense. Additionally, NGFWs facilitate role-based access control, ensuring granular control over network access based on user roles. Advanced policy management empowers administrators with control over application usage. NGFWs deliver these robust protections without compromising network performance. This translates to a streamlined security infrastructure with centralized management, enabling swift deployment of new security strategies across the entire network.
Hardware-based NGFWs are encountering growing challenges in securing modern, highly distributed IT environments. The traditional model of centralizing all traffic through a data center for NGFW inspection creates performance bottlenecks for cloud-based applications and geographically dispersed users. While geographically distributed deployments with local Internet breakouts can improve performance, they introduce significant management complexity and ongoing costs. Additionally, effectively inspecting the ever-increasing volume of encrypted traffic, a critical security requirement, often relies on software-based proxy capabilities within NGFWs. These software solutions can have a detrimental impact on overall network performance and user experience.
Cloud firewalls
Like a regular firewall, a cloud firewall is a security solution that filters potentially dangerous network traffic. On the other hand, cloud firewalls function inside the cloud environment, unlike conventional firewalls. FWaaS is another name for this cloud-hosted firewall model. Like traditional firewalls that protect an organization's internal network, cloud-based firewalls provide a virtual barrier around cloud platforms, infrastructure, and applications. Additionally, cloud firewalls have the capability to protect on-premise infrastructure.
Cloud firewalls provide companies moving to the cloud with a complete security solution. They filter traffic from various sources, such as tenants, virtual data centers, virtual networks, and the Internet. This guarantees safe connections between cloud computing and actual data centers. Like on-premises firewalls, cloud firewalls offer advanced access controls, connection management, and filtering between clients and the cloud—even for encrypted content—to ensure a consistent security posture. They also interact with access control providers to give users control over user identity protection and filtering tools. Subsequently, performance management elements that are normally only available in on-premises solutions are now included in cloud firewalls. These features include performance, visibility, usage, configuration, and logging tools. This combination of security, access control, and performance management makes cloud firewalls a powerful tool for organizations in the cloud.
Cost optimization through service-based pricing for cloud firewalls can be advantageous. However, it necessitates a careful evaluation of potential drawbacks. One key consideration is the leaving of some control over vital security configurations. Furthermore, the migration process to a different cloud provider in the future may introduce compatibility challenges. Consequently, security teams are often maintained by many service providers to respond to major issues.
