This exponential increase in address space allows for a virtually limitless number of unique IP addresses, accommodating the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
    

     Each IPv6 address is
    



     composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons, which can represent a vast range of IP addresses, making it ideal for the expansive needs of
    


      modern networks.
     




     In the following figure, the IPv6 address
    


      is highlighted.

     The
    


      ipcalc
     


     program can also
    



     work with IPv6 addresses; however,
    


      Sipcalc
     


     has more features and displays more information about IPv6 by default.
    

     Sipcalc can be installed by entering the
    


      sudo apt install -y sipcalc
     


     command.
    

     The following figure shows how to
    


      use
     




       sipcalc
      




      :

     In the interest of staying
    



     on subject, this is as far as we’re going to go into IPv6 addresses.
    

     However, we will be reviewing common IPv6 attacks a little later in
