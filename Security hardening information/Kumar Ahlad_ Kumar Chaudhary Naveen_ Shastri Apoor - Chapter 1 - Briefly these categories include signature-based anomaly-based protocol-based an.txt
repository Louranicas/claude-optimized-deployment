Briefly, these categories include signature-based, anomaly-based, protocol-based, and hybrid approaches [5].



Long Description for Figure 5.1
The anomaly-based NIDS starts with establishing a baseline and detecting deviations, which trigger alarms. The specification-based NIDS uses network protocol and system behavior specifications to detect anomalies. The signature-based NIDS monitors events, matching them with a signature database to trigger alerts. The hybrid NIDS combines all three types to offer comprehensive threat detection, with each method contributing to the overall detection process. The diagram illustrates the interconnected roles each NIDS type plays in providing robust intrusion detection.

FIGURE 5.1 Types of NIDS.

The functions of several NIDS are depicted in Figure 5.
