Supply Chain Risk Management and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
DOI: 10.4324/9781003604969-4


Supply Chain Risk Management
Effective risk management of supply chain risk is crucial. Conducting risk management is a continuous process that requires a comprehensive and proactive approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities.
Rashid et al. (2024) found that information processing capability and digital supply chain significantly affect supply chain risk management and resilience. Supply chain risk management positively mediates the relationship between information processing capability and digital supply chains.1 So there is a very clear link. Globalisation, specialisation, outsourcing, lean operations, rapid changes, geopolitical challenges, and complex supply chains make risk management crucial in SCM. Risks include quality defects, supply shortages, legal issues, natural disasters, exchange rate fluctuations, port congestions, regulatory compliance, and terrorism. Disruptions can occur anytime and anywhere in the supply chain.
Shishehgarkhaneh et al. (2024) argue that use of artificial intelligence in supply chain risk management is highly beneficial as the process of risk management inherently relies on identifying and minimising risk, managing impacts which are central to the procurement process. Organisations should look beyond first-tier suppliers to assess risks from second-tier suppliers.2
While organisations can influence suppliers through direct interaction and contract management, it’s harder across the entire supply chain. Regular meetings with key organisations in the supply chain can help share messages and learnings.3
Organisations should encourage first-tier suppliers to enforce behaviours throughout their supply chains. This can be formalised by including contract requirements for first-tier suppliers to assess their suppliers with the same standards the organisation uses. This practice was used in the 2012 London Olympics.
Odimarha et al. (2024) contend that emerging technologies can be used to provide greater transparency across the supply chain. Use of IoT sensors, AI, and blockchain can enable continuous monitoring, risk assessment, and secure information sharing reducing risk to all parties through the supply chain.4
By adopting a structured risk management framework, organisations can enhance their resilience and ensure the continuity of their operations in the face of potential disruptions.
Risk identification is the first step in the risk management process. Identify potential risks and vulnerabilities within the supply chain. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as supply chain mapping, supplier assessments, data analysis, and scenario planning exercises. Collaborating with stakeholders and subject matter experts can also provide valuable insights into potential risks.
Risk assessment is crucial once risks have been identified. Assess their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the organisation. This assessment can be conducted using tools and techniques such as risk assessment matrices, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), or Monte Carlo simulations. Prioritising risks based on their severity and probability can help organisations allocate resources effectively.5
Risk mitigation planning comes after assessing the risks. Organisations should develop comprehensive mitigation plans to address the identified vulnerabilities. These plans may include strategies such as diversification of suppliers, inventory optimisation, business continuity planning, cybersecurity measures, and contingency planning for various disruption scenarios.6
Implementation and monitoring is the next step. Implement the risk mitigation plans and continuously monitor the supply chain for emerging risks or changes in existing vulnerabilities. This may involve deploying specialised risk management software, conducting regular audits and assessments, and fostering collaboration and information sharing with stakeholders.7
Continuous improvement is essential. Risk management is an iterative process that requires continuous improvement and adaptation. Organisations should regularly review and update their risk management strategies based on lessons learned, changes in the business environment, and the adoption of new technologies or best practices. Encouraging a culture of continuous improvement can help organisations stay ahead of potential supply chain vulnerabilities. Emerging technologies like AI and machine learning can help improve monitoring, ensure continuous risk assessment, and embed continuous improvement.8
Stakeholder engagement and communication helps to identify and mitigate risks. Effective risk management requires collaboration and communication with internal and external stakeholders, including suppliers, partners, regulatory bodies, and industry associations. Sharing information, best practices, and risk intelligence can enhance overall supply chain resilience and foster a collaborative approach to risk mitigation.
By embracing a comprehensive risk management approach and fostering a culture of proactive risk identification and mitigation, organisations can fortify their supply chain resilience and ensure operational continuity in the face of potential disruptions.
Supply chain risk management as a process starts with identifying all possible risks, followed by prioritisation, mitigation, management, and communication to stakeholders.
A critical step is assigning responsibility to risk owners in the team or Project Implementation Unit (PIU), who are accountable for monitoring, mitigating, and managing risks. Risk owners must understand their responsibilities and the management strategy.
After mitigating or managing risks, it’s important to learn from these experiences to refine approaches. The process should be a continuous cycle, with activities reinforcing each other. This circular process can be conducted alongside procurement risk analysis.
Step 1: Risk Identification
Risks are unexpected and varied, so nobody can capture every risk but aim for as many possible choke points as you can. Typical risks for identification include those below:

Table  4.1  Risk Taxonomy


Risk Category
Risk Type
Risk Description




Supplier performance
Financial
Risk associated with the financial health of the supplier, which could result in bankruptcy, causing supply interruptions and other losses


Quality
Risk associated with the quality of products or services provided by a supplier


Delivery
Risk of the supplier failing to deliver the product/service on time


Capacity
Risk of the supplier not having sufficient capacity to satisfy demand


Integrity
Risks associated with corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive, or obstructive practices by the supplier


Reputation
Risk associated with negative effects on the brand or reputation of the organisation caused by supplier practices or actions


Environmental and social
Social
Risk associated with activities in the supply chain such as engagement of workers, safe working conditions, social impacts on local communities due to labour influx, engagement with stakeholders, and impacts associated with use of land


Environmental
Risk associated with activities in the supply chain such as hazardous waste, pollution, carbon emission, actions that cause conversion or degradation of natural or critical habitats


Health and safety
Risk associated with suppliers not following relevant occupational health and safety requirements, including the handling of hazardous conditions and substances, ineffective safety training, incomplete records of incidents and accidents, lack of preparedness to respond to incidents, and lack of remedies for adverse impacts

Category
Risk associated with a specific supply category, caused, for instance, by highly complex and fragmented supply chains


Raw material
Risk associated with specific raw materials, which can include global shortages and competition from other industries


Logistics
Risk associated with the transportation and storage of products across the supply chain


Technology
Cybersecurity
Risk associated with the theft of or damage to the organisation’s or supplier’s hardware, software, or information, including possible disruption to their operations


Intellectual property
Risk involving a potential loss of intellectual property


Geopolitical
Domestic
Risk associated with changes in policy in the domestic market of organisation that can affect its ability or costs of sourcing, such as changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, and trade sanctions


Labour
Risk associated with labour disputes that could disrupt the production and delivery of products and services


Legal
Risk that exposes the organisation to potential legal actions or disputes in international trade


Macroeconomic
Currency
Risk associated with currency volatility that might negatively affect an organisation’s profitability (sometimes also termed foreign exchange risk)


Inflation/volatility
Risk associated with inflationary pressure or swift changes in the price of raw materials and labour in source countries


Natural disasters

Risk associated with disruptions affecting the operation of suppliers or the flow of products, due to major natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, hurricanes, fires, and floods



Organisations should note that this is just one framework that can be adapted to suit a project’s needs. The ability to address these risks depends largely on the organisation’s influence over its suppliers. It’s important to understand the supply market, consider how attractive the procurement is to suppliers, and assess their ability to manage identified risks.
In challenging environments, such as those affected by fragility, conflict, and violence, organisations may consider engaging specialist support or requesting hands-on expanded implementation support.

Step 2: Risk Prioritisation
Once risks are identified, they can be prioritised by their likelihood and potential severity. Likelihood assesses how probable a risk is, while severity assesses its impact. This assessment is subjective, but organisations can use prior experience and information from the procurement process.
Prioritisation can be done using a five-category scale:

= Very Low (VL).
= Low (L).
= Medium (M).
= High (H).
= Very High (VH).

Based on these classifications, organisations can plot each risk on a risk criticality matrix. This matrix, sometimes called a heat map, shows high overall risk in red, and lower risks in amber and green.

Step 3: Risk Mitigation and Management
Organisations can use the heat map to determine how to address these risks, using the colours to categorise risks on a scale from high to low risk. Typical actions for each category include:

High risk: Address through ongoing assessments and contingency plans (e.g., alternative sources, higher inventory, inspections, and audits).
Substantial risk: Address with periodic assessments, monitoring, and contingency plans.
Moderate risk: Manage via routine procedures and internal reporting. Organisations may accept these low-priority risks.
Low risk: Accept as part of doing business or monitor as needed.

The supply chain risk management process can lead to four main strategies:

Avoid: Do not pursue the current supply chain design if risks are too severe. For example, if forced labour risk is high, find an alternative design with suppliers that have strict workforce protection policies.
Minimise: Implement the design but mitigate risks through improved monitoring or process modifications. For example, require regular reporting and inspections.
Spread or transfer: Implement the design but reduce risk via diversification, subcontracting, outsourcing, joint ventures, hedging, or insurance. For example, purchase scarce components and provide them to the supplier, giving more control but also greater liability.
Accept: Implement the design and accept associated risks. For example, accept small quality defects if they can be corrected easily and inexpensively without harm to stakeholders.


Step 4: Risk Communication and Learning
Learning from past successes and failures is crucial. A template for recording this information is available,9 which can be shared to refine risk management approaches and increase expertise.
Capturing the information in a risk management plan: Organisations can compile insights into a risk management plan. This plan offers a transparent way to review, compare, and prioritise risks, and develop action plans if needed. There is no right or wrong way to do this. Think about risks, classify them, and find mitigation strategies.

Case Studies
Real-life case studies of supply chain vulnerabilities help us bring to life the real and present risks that exist in our businesses. Supply chain vulnerabilities are not mere theoretical constructs; they manifest in real-world scenarios, impacting businesses across industries and geographies. Examining real-life case studies can provide valuable insights into the potential consequences of supply chain disruptions and the importance of proactive risk mitigation strategies.
The 2011 Thailand floods had huge impact. In 2011, severe flooding in Thailand disrupted the operations of numerous manufacturing facilities, including those of major automotive and electronics companies. The disruption rippled through global supply chains, causing production delays and shortages of critical components. This event highlighted the vulnerability of supply chains to natural disasters and the need for geographic diversification and contingency planning.
The Fukushima nuclear disaster was catastrophic. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, had far-reaching consequences for global supply chains. The disaster disrupted production of critical components used in various industries, including automotive and electronics. This event underscored the importance of supply chain resilience and the need for robust risk management strategies.
The Suez Canal blockage caused severe disruption. In March 2021, a massive container ship became wedged in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the world’s most critical maritime trade routes for nearly a week. This disruption caused significant delays and backlogs in global supply chains, highlighting the vulnerability of transportation networks and the need for contingency plans and alternative routes.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to shortages the world over. The global COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains across industries, from healthcare to consumer goods. Disruptions in manufacturing, transportation, and labour availability have led to shortages, delays, and increased costs. This event has underscored the need for agility, diversification, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.
The NotPetya cyber attack hit well -corporations hard. In 2017, the NotPetya cyber attack targeted Ukrainian organisations but quickly spread globally, impacting major corporations like Maersk, Merck, and FedEx. This attack disrupted operations, caused significant financial losses, and highlighted the vulnerability of supply chains to cyber threats and the need for robust cybersecurity measures.
These real-life examples serve as sobering reminders of the far-reaching consequences of supply chain vulnerabilities and the importance of proactive risk management strategies. By learning from these events, organisations can better prepare for and mitigate potential disruptions, enhancing their overall supply chain resilience.
Safeguarding your supply chain from hidden vulnerabilities is not just a matter of business continuity; it’s a strategic imperative that can spell the difference between success and failure in today’s interconnected global marketplace.

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
In the ever-evolving landscape of supply chain management, proactive measures are paramount to mitigating risks and ensuring seamless operations. One such powerful tool is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), a systematic approach that identifies potential failures, evaluates their effects, and implements preventive actions. By employing FMEA, we can unlock a realm of opportunities to enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain a competitive edge.
Marco-Ferreira et al. (2023) argue FMEA can be highly effective and in some cases more effective than alternatives to reduce risk in the supply chain and provide preventive actions. Alternatives considered include the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy logic DEMATEL, and disruption analysis network (DA_NET) methods.10
FMEA is a structured methodology that originated in the aerospace industry but has since been adopted across various sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics. Its core objective is to anticipate and address potential failures before they occur, thereby minimising disruptions and maximising operational excellence.
Carvalho et al. (2022) insist FMEA as an approach is effective in assessing resilience including that of critical infrastructure, providing a cost-effective way to evaluate plausible alternatives concerning the improvement of preventive measures.11
We must delve into the intricacies of FMEA and its invaluable role in supply chain management. From understanding its components to implementing best practices, we will explore how this powerful tool can fortify your supply chain operations and propel your business toward unprecedented success.
Ghadir et al. (2022) assert that traditional FMEA can be highly effective for supply chain risk, especially when combined with Best–Worst Method (BWM), applying appropriate risk weights. This approach can help assess the potential impact of major disruptions.12
The value of FMEA should not be underestimated. The modern supply chain is a complex web of interconnected processes, involving numerous stakeholders, intricate logistics, and stringent quality standards. Any disruption or failure within this intricate system can have far-reaching consequences, impacting customer satisfaction, profitability, and brand reputation.
FMEA plays a crucial role in supply chain management by identifying potential risks. By systematically analysing each process step, FMEA helps identify potential risks, bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities that could lead to failures or disruptions. Prioritising critical areas is essential. FMEA assigns risk priority numbers (RPNs) to potential failures, allowing organisations to prioritise their efforts and allocate resources effectively. Implementing preventive measures helps provide assurance. Through the development of robust control plans, FMEA enables the implementation of preventive and corrective actions, mitigating the likelihood and impact of failures.
Enhancing quality and compliance are proven methods to deal with regulation. FMEA promotes adherence to industry standards, regulatory requirements, and quality management systems, ensuring consistent product quality and customer satisfaction. Fostering continuous improvement allows for learning. By regularly reviewing and updating FMEA analyses, organisations can continuously improve their processes, adapt to changing market conditions, and stay ahead of emerging risks.
Understanding the components of FMEA is crucial. FMEA comprises several key components that work in tandem to provide a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation framework.
Failure modes are potential ways in which a process, product, or service could fail to meet specified requirements or customer expectations. Failure effects are the consequences or impacts of a particular failure mode on the overall system, process, or end user. Severity rating is a numerical score assigned to each failure effect, reflecting the magnitude of its potential impact. Occurrence rating is a numerical score assigned to each failure mode, indicating the likelihood of its occurrence. Detection rating is a numerical score assigned to each failure mode, representing the ability to detect the failure before it reaches the end user or customer. Risk priority number (RPN) is a calculated value derived from the product of the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings, used to prioritise and address high-risk areas. Recommended actions are preventive and corrective measures proposed to address identified failure modes and mitigate their effects.
By systematically evaluating these components, FMEA provides a structured framework for risk assessment and mitigation, enabling organisations to make informed decisions and implement proactive strategies.
Conducting an effective FMEA requires a structured approach and collaboration among cross-functional teams. Assemble a cross-functional team. Gather a diverse team of subject matter experts, including representatives from various departments (e.g., engineering, operations, quality, and supply chain). Clearly define the scope and objectives of the FMEA, whether it is focused on a specific process, product, or service. Establish the objectives and desired outcomes. Map the process flow. Create a detailed process map or diagram, outlining each step and identifying potential failure modes. For each process step, brainstorm and identify all potential failure modes that could occur. Determine failure effects by analysing the consequences or impacts of each identified failure mode on the overall system, process, or end user. Using established rating scales, assign numerical scores for severity, occurrence, and detection for each failure mode. Calculate RPNs by multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings to obtain the RPN for each failure mode. Prioritise and address high-risk areas: develop recommended actions to mitigate or eliminate these risks. Execute the recommended actions, such as process improvements, design modifications, or additional controls, to address the identified risks. Continuously monitor with regular review and update the FMEA analysis to reflect changes in processes, products, or services, and to identify new potential risks.
By following this structured approach, you can ensure a comprehensive and effective FMEA implementation, enabling proactive risk management and continuous improvement within your supply chain operations.
Benefits of implementing FMEA should be considered. Integrating FMEA into your supply chain management strategy yields numerous benefits that can significantly enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance. By identifying and addressing potential failures, FMEA helps ensure consistent product quality, service reliability, and adherence to industry standards and regulations. Proactive risk mitigation through FMEA can reduce costs and waste as it prevents costly product recalls, rework, and downtime, ultimately reducing operational costs and minimising waste. By delivering high-quality products and services consistently, FMEA contributes to improved customer satisfaction, loyalty, and brand reputation. FMEA facilitates streamlined processes, optimised resource allocation, and effective risk management, leading to improved operational efficiency throughout the supply chain. By implementing FMEA, organisations can gain a competitive edge by delivering superior quality, reliability, and customer experience, setting themselves apart from competitors. FMEA supports compliance with industry-specific regulations, quality management systems, and safety standards, ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. The systematic approach of FMEA fosters a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging organisations to regularly review and enhance their processes, products, and services.
By leveraging the power of FMEA, organisations can proactively mitigate risks, optimise operations, and drive sustainable growth within their supply chain ecosystem.

Case Studies
Case studies are useful in providing real-life examples of FMEA in action. To illustrate the practical application and benefits of FMEA in supply chain management, let’s explore two real-life case studies:
Case Study 1: Automotive Manufacturing (Ford Motor Company)13
Ford, a leading automotive manufacturer, implemented FMEA to enhance the quality and reliability of their supply chain operations. By conducting a comprehensive FMEA analysis, they identified potential failure modes in their production processes, such as defective components, assembly errors, and quality control issues.
Through the FMEA process, the manufacturer assigned RPNs to each identified failure mode, prioritising high-risk areas. They then developed and implemented recommended actions, including:

Implementing stricter incoming material inspections.
Redesigning assembly processes to minimise human error.
Enhancing quality control procedures.
Providing specialised training to production personnel.

As a result of their FMEA implementation, Ford experienced a significant reduction in product defects, warranty claims, and customer complaints. Additionally, they achieved cost savings through improved operational efficiency and reduced rework and waste.

Case Study 2: Biopharmaceutical Supply Chain (Talecris Biotherapeutics)14
Talecris Biotherapeutics, a leading biopharmaceutical company, recognised the importance of FMEA in ensuring the integrity and safety of their supply chain operations. They conducted an FMEA analysis focused on their cold chain logistics processes, which are critical for maintaining the efficacy and quality of temperature-sensitive biopharmaceutical products.
Through the FMEA process, they identified potential failure modes such as temperature excursions during transportation, equipment malfunctions, and human errors in handling and storage. The company assigned RPNs to these failure modes and developed recommended actions, including:

Implementing real-time temperature monitoring systems.
Upgrading refrigerated transportation vehicles.
Enhancing staff training on proper handling and storage procedures.
Developing contingency plans for equipment failures.

By implementing these FMEA-driven recommendations, the biopharmaceutical company significantly reduced the risk of product spoilage, maintained product quality and efficacy, and ensured compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. Additionally, they experienced improved customer satisfaction and minimised the financial impact of product losses.
These case studies demonstrate the powerful impact of FMEA in enhancing supply chain management across diverse industries, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in mitigating risks, improving quality, and driving operational excellence.
Wong et al. (2023) argue FMEA is crucial in the pharmaceutical industry in reducing risk in supply chains.15 The European Medicines Agency provided guidance on the effective implementation of FMEA for the pharmaceutical industry.16
Challenges and Best Practices with FMEA
While FMEA is a valuable tool for supply chain management, it is essential to acknowledge and address its potential challenges and limitations. By understanding these factors, organisations can effectively mitigate risks and maximise the benefits of FMEA implementation.
Conducting a comprehensive FMEA analysis can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly for complex processes or products with numerous components and failure modes. The assignment of severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be influenced by subjective judgements and biases, potentially leading to inaccurate risk assessments. Accurate and reliable data is crucial for effective FMEA analysis. Lack of historical data or incomplete information can hinder the identification and assessment of potential failure modes. Effective FMEA implementation relies on the collaboration and expertise of cross-functional teams. Challenges may arise due to communication barriers, lack of subject matter expertise, or conflicting priorities among team members. As processes, products, or technologies evolve, FMEA analyses may become outdated, requiring regular updates and revisions to maintain their relevance and effectiveness. Successful FMEA implementation often requires a cultural shift within the organisation, embracing a proactive risk management approach. Resistance to change or lack of buy-in from stakeholders can hinder the adoption and effectiveness of FMEA.
To address these challenges, organisations should allocate adequate resources and time for thorough FMEA analyses. They must implement robust training programmes to mitigate subjectivity and biases. They should establish robust data collection and management systems. It helps to foster cross-functional collaboration and leverage subject matter expertise. Regularly review and update FMEA analyses to reflect changes in processes, products, or technologies. It is important to cultivate a culture of continuous improvement and risk management.
By proactively addressing these challenges, organisations can maximise the benefits of FMEA and ensure its effective integration into their supply chain management strategies.
Best practices for successful implementation help with embedding. To ensure the successful implementation and sustained effectiveness of FMEA in supply chain management, organisations should adopt best practices.
Secure buy-in and commitment from top management to foster a culture of risk management and continuous improvement throughout the organisation. Encourage cross-functional collaboration and ensure representation from various departments and stakeholders in the FMEA team to leverage diverse perspectives and expertise. Provide comprehensive training to FMEA team members on the methodology, tools, and techniques to ensure consistent and effective implementation. Develop and implement standardised processes, rating scales, and tools for conducting FMEA analyses across the organisation to ensure consistency and comparability. Adopt a data-driven approach by collecting and analysing relevant data from various sources, such as historical records, customer feedback, and industry benchmarks, to inform the FMEA process. Prioritise FMEA efforts based on risk levels, focusing on high-risk areas or processes that have the greatest potential impact on supply chain operations and customer satisfaction. Regularly monitor and review FMEA analyses to ensure their relevance and effectiveness, incorporating changes in processes, products, technologies, or regulatory requirements. Integrate FMEA with other quality management initiatives, such as Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, or Total Quality Management, to leverage synergies and drive comprehensive process improvement. Encourage knowledge sharing and the dissemination of lessons learned from FMEA implementations across the organisation to foster continuous learning and improvement. Collaborate with suppliers, vendors, and partners throughout the supply chain to align FMEA efforts, share best practices, and ensure consistent quality and risk management across the entire ecosystem.
By adhering to these best practices, organisations can maximise the benefits of FMEA, foster a culture of proactive risk management, and drive sustainable improvements in supply chain operations.
Tools and software are crucial for FMEA in supply chain management. To streamline and enhance the implementation of FMEA in supply chain management, organisations can leverage various tools and software solutions. These tools facilitate efficient data collection, analysis, and collaboration, enabling more effective risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
Dedicated FMEA software applications provide a centralised platform for conducting FMEA analyses, capturing data, calculating RPNs, and generating reports. These tools often include customisable templates, risk prioritisation features, and collaboration capabilities. Quality management systems (QMS), such as those offered by leading providers like Sparta Systems, Greenlight Guru, and MasterControl, integrate FMEA functionality, enabling seamless integration of risk management processes with other quality initiatives. While not as robust as dedicated FMEA software, spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can be used to create customised FMEA templates, perform calculations, and generate basic reports.
Project management platforms like Trello, Asana, or Microsoft Teams can facilitate collaboration, task assignment, and communication among FMEA team members, ensuring efficient coordination and information sharing.
Data analytics and visualisation tools: Tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) can be leveraged to analyse FMEA data, generate insightful visualisations, and identify patterns or trends that inform risk mitigation strategies.
Specialised risk management software solutions, such as those offered by providers like Riskturn, Palisade, or Protecht, can integrate FMEA functionality into broader enterprise risk management frameworks.
When selecting tools and software for FMEA implementation, organisations should consider factors such as user-friendliness, integration capabilities, scalability, and support for industry-specific requirements. Additionally, providing adequate training and ensuring user adoption are crucial for maximising the benefits of these tools.
Grabill et al. (2024) contend FMEA software and tooling can be improved further through AI augmentation. They suggest FMEA can be used in reliability engineering and software development by presenting a novel AI-augmented tool for d-FMEA and d-FMECA processes, offering a significant leap forward in terms of efficiency and user engagement. By integrating principles of risk assessment and reliability engineering into the software development process, we can use a more powerful graphical user interface and clearer, more insightful assessments.17
Maximising supply chain efficiency is made possible with FMEA. In the dynamic and complex landscape of supply chain management, proactive risk mitigation and continuous improvement are essential for achieving operational excellence and maintaining a competitive edge. FMEA is a powerful tool that empowers organisations to identify potential failures, evaluate their effects, and implement preventive actions, ultimately enhancing supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction.
By leveraging the systematic approach of FMEA, organisations can identify and mitigate potential risks and vulnerabilities within their supply chain processes.
