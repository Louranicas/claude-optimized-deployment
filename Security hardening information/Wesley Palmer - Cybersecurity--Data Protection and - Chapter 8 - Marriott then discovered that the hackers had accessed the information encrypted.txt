# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Wesley Palmer - Cybersecurity--Data Protection and Strategies (2025, Outskirts Press) - libgen.li
Chapter: 8 - Marriott then discovered that the hackers had accessed the information, encrypted it and attempted to remove it. It took Marriott until late November to decrypt the information.
“It’s not just that it’s been continuing for four years, but that there were significant opportunities for higher scrutiny,” said Paige Boshell, an attorney with Alabama-based Privacy Counsel LLC who advises on cyber risk management and response.
The news release specified that the company used encryption to protect credit card numbers. But Connie Kim, a Marriott spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether other personally identifiable information — including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers — was protected in this way, as security experts recommend.
The company acknowledged, however, a possible failing in the encryption security it had for credit card numbers, saying that it could not “rule out the possibility” that encryption keys were taken by hackers, allowing access to troves of valuable payment data. The most secure systems lock up data with encryption keys and also make sure those keys are stored safely.
“The fact that they can’t rule out that the keys were taken sounds like a problem,” said Matthew D. Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer.
It’s not the first time Starwood has been hacked. In 2015, Starwood, along with other luxury hotel brands such as Trump Hotels and Mandarin Oriental, fell prey to credit card breaches. Malware aimed at stealing credit and debit card information was found on payment systems at restaurants and stores in 54 Starwood hotels in North America, according to a 2016 online letter from company president Sergio D. Rivera. That breach happened just days after the Marriott acquisition was announced.
Cybersecurity experts on Friday debated whether the hackers likely were criminals collecting data for identity theft or nation-state spies collecting information on travelers worldwide. Hotel chains, with their vast customer databases and proprietary Wi-Fi networks, can make appealing targets.
“We know that the hospitality business is a very attractive target for nation-states,” said Thomas Rid, a political science professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who specializes in cybersecurity issues. “You can more easily hack some high-value targets from within a hotel WIFI.”
The presence of passport numbers in data accessed by hackers is unusual for even a large breach, but such information is routinely collected by hotels in many countries, especially from international travelers. A passport number is not enough, by itself, to make a credible fake passport that could fool border agents or other government security officials, but it’s yet another piece of useful data for a criminal attempting identity theft.
The U.S. State Department issued a statement following reports of the breach Friday, “We are aware that some individuals’ passport numbers may have been disclosed, but would like to emphasize that none of the U.S. Department of State’s records or IT systems connect to Marriott’s records or systems. No one can access the Department’s records or obtain copies of a U.S. citizen’s records by using a passport number.”
Large amounts of travel data went online several decades ago, long before many other kinds of sensitive records, through computerized airline ticketing and hotel reservation systems, but the travel industry has lagged behind some others in adopting advanced forms of security, privacy advocates say.
Health and some other categories of information are singled out for specific protections under federal law. But travel data is not, even though it can paint a precise picture of a person’s movements, lifestyle, and relationships — down to whether two people traveling together choose one bed or two as they travel. Reservation systems also can provide advanced notice of where somebody is traveling, which could provide crucial political, military or business intelligence.
Security expert Matt Tait, a former British intelligence officer, said it was unclear whether the hackers were spies or mere criminals, though he suspected Marriott was a victim of a nation-state attack because the access lasted for so long without triggering suspicion.
“Nation-states are happy to watch and use the information very passively while criminals want to turn it into cash,” said Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin.
Gary Leff, author of the View from the Wing blog, said that there have been numerous hacks in recent years in the travel industry and that information from rewards programs regularly gets bought and sold by criminals online. He expressed skepticism that the Starwood reservation system hack came from a foreign intelligence service.
“I don’t think it necessarily would have taken a nation-state to crack into Starwood IT,” said Leff.
Government officials on Friday called for stricter enforcement in consumer data privacy. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro all said their offices had opened investigations into the Marriott breach.
“Checking in to a hotel should not mean checking out of privacy and security protections,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “Preventing massive data breaches is not just about protecting privacy, it’s also about protecting our pocketbooks. Breaches like this can lead to identity theft and crippling financial fraud. They are a black cloud hanging over the United States’ bright economic horizon.”
The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the cybersecurity standards of companies, is likely to investigate the Marriott breach, said David C. Vladeck, former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and now a Georgetown Law professor. The FTC declined to comment.
“My assumption would be this is something that the FTC would take a very serious look at,” Vladeck said. “This is a massive breach. It is half a billion people.”
In a filing reporting the breach to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Marriott said that while it was too early to estimate the financial impact of the breach on the company, it did not anticipate it would affect Marriott’s “long-term financial health.”
The hotel chain has set up a website and call center to answer questions at info.starwood.com, and said it is emailing affected guests beginning Friday.

Target estimates breach affected up to 110 million

The massive data heist at Target stores across the country was more massive than previously revealed, with the retailer saying at least 70 to 110 million customers were hit -- making it one of the largest security breaches of its kind. The newly disclosed victims could include customers whose data was obtained by Target prior to Black Friday. The company said Friday that as part of its ongoing probe.
The massive data heist at Target stores across the country was more massive than previously revealed, with the retailer saying at least 70 to 110 million customers were hit -- making it one of the largest security breaches of its kind.
The newly disclosed victims could include customers whose data was obtained by Target prior to Black Friday.
The company said Friday that as part of its ongoing probe it found information for at least 70 million people, apart from the 40 million payment card accounts previously disclosed, was stolen during the data breach. It said this is not a new breach. There may be some overlap between the two groups, Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman said, but it’s unclear by how much.
The stolen information includes names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses for up to 70 million individuals.
“I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,” said Gregg Steinfeld, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Target, in a statement on its website. “I also want our guests to know that understanding and sharing the facts related to this incident is important to me and the entire Target team.”
Target said that much of the data stolen is partial, but in situations where Target has an email address, it will attempt to contact the customers affected by the breach and provide them with tips to guard against consumer scams. Target said it will not ask customers for any personal information when it contacts them.
Even though the data is in bits and pieces, it means some of the previously disclosed stolen credit cards can be used to commit fraud in more places online.
In addition, it could be a precursor to more widespread identity theft.
“They steal and combine what was stolen in previous breaches,” said Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst at technology research company Gartner. “There are warehouses of information on people and dossiers. Now we’ve got John’s credit card, his address, his phone number… they do put it together and sell entire profiles on people.”
Attorneys general from New York and Massachusetts announced on Friday that they were joining a nationwide probe into the security breach.
Target initially reported in mid-December that about 40 million people who used credit or debit cards at its stores from November 27th to December 15th had their information compromised. At that time, the company said the information swiped from its systems included customers’ names, expiration dates, credit card numbers, and verification codes.
The breach was first reported by Krebs on Security, a data security blog. It occurred over some of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season, including Black Friday, and ran from Nov. 27 through Dec. 15, according to Target.
It added that customers will have no liability for the cost of any fraudulent charges. And it will offer one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for all customers who shopped in its stores.

Facebook Data Breaches: Full Timeline Through 2022
Source: Facebook Data Breaches: Full Timeline Through 2022 (firewalltimes.com)
The most recent Facebook data breach happened in April 2021, when personal data pertaining to 533 million Facebook users was made public on an online forum. This information, which included names, phone numbers, and more, was originally scraped using Facebook’s contact importer in 2019.
As far as we can tell, there have been no known Facebook breaches so far in 2022. Below, we’ll get into the full history of Facebook’s data breaches and privacy violations, starting with the most recent.
April 2021: Personal Data for Over 530 million Facebook Users Leaks in Online Forum
In April 2021, a trove of data pertaining to over 530 million Facebook users was publicly posted in an online hacking forum. The leaked data appears to have been scraped from Facebook in 2019, when a group of hackers exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s contact importer.
Back then, users could readily find people on Facebook by entering phone numbers into a contact importer. In violation of Facebook’s terms of service, hackers scraped users’ profile data by exploiting this tool. Most of the scraped data was tied to users’ phone numbers, and only 2.5 million email addresses were obtained.
Facebook fixed the vulnerability by September 2019. But they decided against notifying the 530 million users whose personal data had been scrapped.
In an internal memo, Facebook dismissed the incident as a data scraping issue, unavoidable for social media platforms: “We expect more scraping incidents and think it’s important to both frame this as a broad industry issue and normalize the fact that this activity happens regularly.”
As a result of this and other incidents, Facebook has come under pressure from the European Union for violating its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In October 2021, the Irish Data Protection Commission proposed a fine of up to 36 million euros for these data privacy violations.

June 2020: Facebook Accidentally Shares User Data with Third-Party Developers
In June 2020, Facebook engineers discovered an issue that enabled third-party developers to access personal data on users they should not have had access to. They promptly fixed the issue, and on July 1st, 2020, Facebook made the issue public via a blog post.
Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, Facebook had implemented a new policy that would only allow developers to access customer data within 90 days of using the developer’s app. But until Facebook discovered and fixed the issue, thousands of developers could still see data on inactive users if those inactive users were Facebook friends with someone who was an active user.
December 2019: Hacker Group Captures Data from 300+ Million Facebook Accounts
In December 2019, Facebook user data from approximately 267 million accounts was found unprotected on the dark web. The data included names, phone numbers, and Facebook IDs. Then, in March 2020, a second server was discovered that contained data on 42 million more users, bringing the total up to 309 million.
Both servers were associated with the same criminal group, a collection of hackers based in Vietnam. It’s believed that Facebook API abuse or illegal scraping were involved in the data capture.
This batch of stolen data came up for sale on the dark web again in April, 2020. Once data is exposed, it’s hard to put the genie back in the bottle.
September 2019: Data for 419 million Facebook Users Found on Exposed Server
An unsecured server holding personal data on 419 million Facebook users was found in September 2019. The server was publicly accessible, allowing potentially anyone to find the Facebook ID and phone number of the impacted user. In some cases, the user’s name, country location, and gender were also in the server records.
The server housing the data didn’t belong to Facebook, and it’s unclear who scraped the data to begin with. The server was eventually taken down.
July 2019: FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook
In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission began a renewed investigation of privacy violations at Facebook. And on July 24, 2019, the FTC announced a $5 billion fine and mandated a new round of requirements to bring Facebook in line.
To maintain oversight, the FTC mandated a restructuring at Facebook from the board-level down, as well as the creation of an independent privacy committee, with new privacy compliance officers at the company subject to this independent board.
This $5 billion penalty is the largest the FTC has ever imposed for privacy violations. The FTC chairman, Joe Simons, described the penalty as follows:
The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.
The 2019 penalty followed a previous FTC investigation that ended in a settlement in November, 2011. But Facebook did not abide by the terms of the 2011 settlement, leading to a renewed investigation and penalty in 2019.
April 2019: Facebook Uploads 1.5 million Users’ Email Contacts Without Permission
Between May 2016 and 2019, Facebook uploaded 1.5 million users’ email contacts without their permission. When the new user opened their account, Facebook asked the person to enter their email password to verify the email. Once that occurred, the person’s contacts’ email addresses were imported automatically, all without Facebook requesting permission or the option for the new user to cancel the process. From there, Facebook began using the information to improve ad targeting and recommend friends.
April 2019: 540 million Facebook User Records Found on Public Server
Researchers with the security firm UpGuard found approximately 540 million Facebook user records captured by app developers stored in an Amazon cloud public server, making the information accessible to the public through the internet. The data included Facebook IDs, account names, comments, reactions, likes, and more.
After the discovery, UpGuard reached out to Cultura Colectiva – the server hosting company – informing them about the unsecured data. Still, it took months before the server was ultimately secured, as no action was taken until Facebook became fully aware of the situation.
Facebook was not directly responsible for this breach, as it was the app developers who improperly stored the information. However, Facebook still bears responsibility over what happens on its platform – and in any case, they have pledged repeatedly not to share users’ information with outside companies.
March 2019: Up to 600 million Facebook Passwords Stored in Plaintext Files
In March 2019, a report found that as many as 600 million Facebook user passwords had been stored in plaintext files, some dating back as far as 2012. While only Facebook employees had access to those files, it meant that user passwords were fully exposed to approximately 2,000 employees.
Later, it was determined that millions of Instagram user passwords were also being stored in plaintext files, leaving them exposed as well. It is not clear if any of the password data was ever improperly used.
December 2018: New York Times Discovers Facebook Sharing User Data Without Permission
In December 2018, the New York Times released a report showing that Facebook had violated users’ consent on privacy. Even after Facebook promised the FTC it would not share user data without explicit permission, Facebook continued to sell users’ information to over 150 companies. Companies such as Netflix and Spotify could even read users’ so-called “private” messages.
In response, Facebook claimed that they considered the companies they shared data with to be extensions of Facebook itself, making this data sharing ‘exempt’ from the FTC’s requirements. This is a frankly ridiculous claim, unless you consider Netflix and Spotify to be part of Facebook (I do not).
Even while Facebook repeatedly promised users that they had control over their privacy, they continued to share highly private information without informing users or asking for their consent. That’s about as clear of a privacy violation as it gets.
September 2018: Attackers Access Data of Up to 90 million Facebook Users
Still reeling from the damage caused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was embroiled in another data breach. In September 2018, Facebook announced that attackers had accessed user data, allowing them to see the entire contents of user profiles.
The breach was able to occur due to a flaw in the platform’s “View As” feature. With that feature, users can view their profile as if they were another user, giving users insights into what other Facebook users could potentially see. An issue in the code gave attackers the ability to steal a user’s access tokens, giving them the ability to view profile information that may otherwise be private.
According to Facebook, the vulnerability went unnoticed for more than one year. Once spotted, the code issue was corrected, and impacted users’ access tokens were reset. In total, the attackers accessed profile data on anywhere from 50 to 90 million users.
May 2018: Facebook Bug Makes 14 million Users’ Private Posts Public
Facebook ostensibly gives users control over who can see their posts and their profile. Usually, users have the ability to make certain posts relatively private, limiting who can view the post to, for example, just specific individuals or those included in their list of friends on Facebook.
In May 2018, a glitch prevented the privacy settings from working correctly. As a result, 14 million users’ private posts were shared publicly even though they were initially posted with viewing limitations. These posts became public without users’ knowledge or consent.
The bug was reportedly related to a new feature Facebook was testing, which rolled out on May 18, 2018. The bug was identified fairly quickly, but a fix for the problem did not begin rolling out until May 22, and the bug was not fully resolved until May 27.
March 2018: Cambridge Analytica Scandal Affects 50+ Million Users
In its biggest privacy scandal to date, Facebook exposed data on 87 million users to the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. This firm got its data through Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge who had access via a quiz app.
Between 2013 and 2015, Cambridge Analytica exploited a loophole in Facebook’s API that enabled it to compile profile data not just from users who downloaded the app, but also from their friend networks. Although Facebook told developers they could not market or sell this kind of data, they did not enforce this policy, allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest and sell it for years without repercussions.
This was a major breach of user privacy, but it cannot really be considered a hack. Facebook knew Cambridge Analytica was misusing user data as far back as 2015, but Facebook refused to acknowledge any issue and did not act until the media raised the heat on its coverage in March 2018.
June 2013: Bug Exposes Personal Data of 6 million Users
In June 2013, news broke of a bug that exposed the sensitive personal data of approximately 6 million Facebook users. The glitch – which was related to the contact information archive – allowed the users’ email addresses and phone numbers to be viewed by unauthorized individuals.
The sensitive data was typically accessed by unauthorized people in error. When a user attempted to download contact information from the connections on their friends list, additional contact details that they were not authorized to view were added to the download.
Technically, the issue surrounding this breach is believed to have begun in 2012. However, the bug was not actually spotted until 2013. As a result, it was in place for about a year before a fix was issued.
January 2013: Facebook’s Graph Search Rollout Ignites Privacy Concerns
In January 2013, Facebook launched Graph Search, which enabled users to search for information on other users and groups. These searches could turn up information such as old comments, likes, and photos, which users might not want to be made publicly available.
Though this did not make any previously private information public, it made otherwise forgotten information much more discoverable, prompting many outlets to recommend users update their privacy settings.
November 2011: Facebook Settles with FTC on Privacy Charges
On November 29, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it arrived at a settlement with Facebook over Facebook’s failings to keep user data private. In a Facebook blog post, Mark Zuckerberg admitted the company had “made a bunch of mistakes.” This post appears to have been taken down, and I can no longer find it on Facebook’s corporate website as of September 2021.
The FTC finalized this settlement on August 10, 2012, following a public comment period. As part of the settlement, the FTC imposed several requirements on Facebook:
The settlement requires Facebook to take several steps to make sure it lives up to its promises in the future, including by giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings, by maintaining a comprehensive privacy program to protect consumers’ information, and by obtaining biennial privacy audits from an independent third party.
As this timeline shows, the 2011 settlement did not put to rest Facebook’s issues with user privacy. When Facebook discovered the Cambridge Analytica scandal, for instance, they did not notify the FTC or the affected users. The record shows that Facebook has not adequately complied with this 2011 settlement, and they have continued to face lawsuits and penalties from the FTC as a result.
May 2010: Facebook Shares User Data with Advertisers via “Privacy Loophole”
In May 2010, the Wall Street Journal found that Facebook had been sharing user data with advertisers without the consent of those users. After this so-called ‘privacy loophole’ came to light, Facebook stated that they did not consider the information involved to be personally identifiable – even though it included details such as a person’s name, age, and hometown.
At the time, Facebook said they closed this particular loophole. But as the timeline shows, it was one of many ways they shared user data with advertisers and other business partners without the clear consent of their users.
December 2009: Facebook Makes Previously Private User Information Public
In December 2009, Facebook made their big shift to a platform where users share information publicly, rather than with their select group of friends. As part of this transition, they converted millions of user profiles from private to public and implemented privacy controls that would supposedly allow users to control who could see their posts and other information.
December 2007: Beacon Advertising Program Allows Facebook User Tracking
When it comes to Facebook’s first big brush with widescale privacy concerns, the launch of Beacon – an advertising program – is likely it. Beacon had the ability to track user purchases on other sites and post about what was bought on Facebook, often without first getting permission from the user. After an outcry, Facebook added an opt-out option for Beacon.
We did not find any earlier records of data breaches or privacy violations involving Facebook.

Computer Program Used by Clinton Campaign Hacked as Part of DNC Cyber Attacks
Source: By Phil Helsel, Josh Meyer, and Jonathan Dienst (2016). (nbcnews.com)
The Clinton campaign said a data program was accessed, but said no evidence has been found its internal systems were compromised.
A computer data program used by Hillary Clinton’s campaign was hacked, the campaign said Friday in the latest revelation in a series of cyber-attacks on Democratic Party properties.
Reuters first reported the cyber attack, and said a computer network used by the Clinton campaign was hacked. Federal officials confirmed to NBC News that the Clinton campaign was hacked. The Clinton campaign said a program used by its campaign was breached, but it said no evidence has been found that the campaign’s internal systems were broken into.
“An analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack,” Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.
“Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,” Merrill said.
The FBI said Friday it is investigating. “The FBI is aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters,” the FBI said.
A Clinton aide said the hackers had access to had access to the analytics program’s server for approximately 5 days. The program is used to conduct voter analysis. It could not have been used to access internal campaign email or other communications or computers, the aide said, citing an outside security expert.
A spokesman for the Donald Trump campaign said Friday: “This seems to be a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasn’t classified or top-secret information that puts American lives at risk.”
News of the hack comes after cyber attacks on Democratic Party groups, including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s computer system.
The DCCC confirmed the hack Friday and said it was “similar” to the cyber attack on the DNC. The hack on the DNC has been blamed on the Russian government.
A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the FBI is investigating the intrusion on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s computer system but that agents have not yet found a link to the earlier DNC hack.
The Kremlin has denied it is behind either breach — and a top official responded to the allegations on Friday by denouncing a “poisonous anti-Russian” narrative coming out of Washington.
The disclosure that the DCCC was hacked escalated concern among U.S. national security officials that the intrusions are aimed at swaying the outcome of the presidential election.
The DCCC, which raises money for Democrats running for House seats, said in a statement that it has retained the forensic investigation firm CrowdStrike, which was also retained by the DNC. The firm concluded two Russian security agencies had hacked into its servers and internal files.
“Based on the information we have to date, we’ve been advised by investigators that this is similar to other recent incidents, including the DNC breach,” DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly said in a statement.
“The DCCC takes this matter very seriously. With the assistance of leading experts, we have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network in the face of these recent events. We are cooperating with the federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.”
Days before the Democratic convention that kicked off Monday, the website WikiLeaks published nearly 20,000 internal emails from Democratic National Committee officials.
Some of the emails appeared to show that some officials favored the Clinton campaign over her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. The emails inflamed suspicions among some Sanders supporters, and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced she would resign.
WikiLeaks did not say where it got the emails it released.
As NBC News reported this week, senior U.S. national security officials are confident that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC but have not determined if those agencies gave the material to WikiLeaks for the pre-convention email release.
Trump further fanned the flames of speculation when he seemed to invite Russia to release any Clinton emails they might have. The comments were condemned as extremely irresponsible in inviting the Russian government to commit espionage against the U.S.
Trump later called his remarks a “joke.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin has complimented Trump in recent weeks. Trump has in the past praised Putin.
Trump last week n an interview with The New York Times suggested that the U.S. would not necessarily defend new NATO members in the Baltics in the event of Russian attack if he were elected to the White House.
Trump said in the interview that doing so would depend on whether those countries had “fulfilled their obligations to us” in terms of their financial contributions to the alliance.
NATO was formed during the Cold War to protect nations from the then-Soviet Union. NATO’s treaty states that an attack on one member state constitutes an attack on all, a principle enshrined in Article 5 of the alliance’s treaty.

Pentagon data breach puts personal details of 30,000 staff at risk
Source: Pentagon data breach puts personal details of 30,000 staff at risk (bitdefender.com)
The Pentagon has admitted that up to 30,000 military workers and civilian personnel have had their personal information and credit card data exposed following a security breach.
The security breach occurred at a third-party vendor which provides travel management services to the Department of Defense.
The vendor, which has not as yet been publicly identified due to security concerns and ongoing contracts, was not however responsible for informing the Pentagon of the breach. Instead, it appears that the DoD’s own computer security team which discovered a breach had occurred.
According to an Associated Press report, it possible that the breach happened “some months ago,” and that further investigations may uncover that even more staffers were exposed.
The Department of Defense says that it has started notifying individuals affected by the security breach, and that those impacted will be offered prepaid identity theft monitoring services.
Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino issued a statement confirming the breach does not affect all staff who have used travel management services:
“The Department is continuing to gather additional information about the incident, which involves the potential compromise of personally identifiable information (PII) of DoD personnel maintained by a single commercial vendor that provided travel management services to the Department. This vendor was performing a small percentage of the overall travel management services of DoD.”
The one piece of good news is that it appears no classified material is likely to have been put at risk through the breach.
News of the breach does, however, come at an awkward time for the US Department of Defense which is currently smarting from a report issued last week by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO).
That report concluded that poor security has made next-generation weapons systems easy to hack.
In one case, it was reported that it was possible for unauthorized users to gain access to a weapons system within just one hour, and that the Pentagon was not following basic security practices such as changing default passwords.
“One test report indicated that the test team was able to guess an administrator password in nine seconds. Multiple weapon systems used commercial or open-source software, but did not change the default password when the software was installed.”
There have, of course, been US government data breaches that have affected a far larger number of individuals than the 30,000 estimated to be impacted in this latest incident.
But that does not make it any less important for organizations like the Department of Defense to consider not only how they best protect their systems, but also how well their third-party service suppliers are securing sensitive DoD data.

The digital world is once again tainted by a highly sensitive data leak that puts millions of users at risk of blackmail attempts, identity theft and fraud.
A team of security researchers led by Anurag Sen recently uncovered a leaky database from CAM4, a popular live-streaming adult website. Housed on a misconfigured Elasticsearch server, the unsecure database exposed around 7TB of personal information from platform users and members.

Marriott then discovered that the hackers had accessed the information, encrypted it and attempted to remove it. It took Marriott until late November to decrypt the information.
“It’s not just that it’s been continuing for four years, but that there were significant opportunities for higher scrutiny,” said Paige Boshell, an attorney with Alabama-based Privacy Counsel LLC who advises on cyber risk management and response.
The news release specified that the company used encryption to protect credit card numbers. But Connie Kim, a Marriott spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether other personally identifiable information — including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers — was protected in this way, as security experts recommend.
The company acknowledged, however, a possible failing in the encryption security it had for credit card numbers, saying that it could not “rule out the possibility” that encryption keys were taken by hackers, allowing access to troves of valuable payment data. The most secure systems lock up data with encryption keys and also make sure those keys are stored safely.
“The fact that they can’t rule out that the keys were taken sounds like a problem,” said Matthew D. Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer.
It’s not the first time Starwood has been hacked. In 2015, Starwood, along with other luxury hotel brands such as Trump Hotels and Mandarin Oriental, fell prey to credit card breaches. Malware aimed at stealing credit and debit card information was found on payment systems at restaurants and stores in 54 Starwood hotels in North America, according to a 2016 online letter from company president Sergio D. Rivera. That breach happened just days after the Marriott acquisition was announced.
Cybersecurity experts on Friday debated whether the hackers likely were criminals collecting data for identity theft or nation-state spies collecting information on travelers worldwide. Hotel chains, with their vast customer databases and proprietary Wi-Fi networks, can make appealing targets.
“We know that the hospitality business is a very attractive target for nation-states,” said Thomas Rid, a political science professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who specializes in cybersecurity issues. “You can more easily hack some high-value targets from within a hotel WIFI.”
The presence of passport numbers in data accessed by hackers is unusual for even a large breach, but such information is routinely collected by hotels in many countries, especially from international travelers. A passport number is not enough, by itself, to make a credible fake passport that could fool border agents or other government security officials, but it’s yet another piece of useful data for a criminal attempting identity theft.
The U.S. State Department issued a statement following reports of the breach Friday, “We are aware that some individuals’ passport numbers may have been disclosed, but would like to emphasize that none of the U.S. Department of State’s records or IT systems connect to Marriott’s records or systems. No one can access the Department’s records or obtain copies of a U.S. citizen’s records by using a passport number.”
Large amounts of travel data went online several decades ago, long before many other kinds of sensitive records, through computerized airline ticketing and hotel reservation systems, but the travel industry has lagged behind some others in adopting advanced forms of security, privacy advocates say.
Health and some other categories of information are singled out for specific protections under federal law. But travel data is not, even though it can paint a precise picture of a person’s movements, lifestyle, and relationships — down to whether two people traveling together choose one bed or two as they travel. Reservation systems also can provide advanced notice of where somebody is traveling, which could provide crucial political, military or business intelligence.
Security expert Matt Tait, a former British intelligence officer, said it was unclear whether the hackers were spies or mere criminals, though he suspected Marriott was a victim of a nation-state attack because the access lasted for so long without triggering suspicion.
“Nation-states are happy to watch and use the information very passively while criminals want to turn it into cash,” said Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin.
Gary Leff, author of the View from the Wing blog, said that there have been numerous hacks in recent years in the travel industry and that information from rewards programs regularly gets bought and sold by criminals online. He expressed skepticism that the Starwood reservation system hack came from a foreign intelligence service.
“I don’t think it necessarily would have taken a nation-state to crack into Starwood IT,” said Leff.
Government officials on Friday called for stricter enforcement in consumer data privacy. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro all said their offices had opened investigations into the Marriott breach.
“Checking in to a hotel should not mean checking out of privacy and security protections,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “Preventing massive data breaches is not just about protecting privacy, it’s also about protecting our pocketbooks. Breaches like this can lead to identity theft and crippling financial fraud. They are a black cloud hanging over the United States’ bright economic horizon.”
The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the cybersecurity standards of companies, is likely to investigate the Marriott breach, said David C. Vladeck, former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and now a Georgetown Law professor. The FTC declined to comment.
“My assumption would be this is something that the FTC would take a very serious look at,” Vladeck said. “This is a massive breach. It is half a billion people.”
In a filing reporting the breach to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Marriott said that while it was too early to estimate the financial impact of the breach on the company, it did not anticipate it would affect Marriott’s “long-term financial health.”
The hotel chain has set up a website and call center to answer questions at info.starwood.com, and said it is emailing affected guests beginning Friday.

Target estimates breach affected up to 110 million

The massive data heist at Target stores across the country was more massive than previously revealed, with the retailer saying at least 70 to 110 million customers were hit -- making it one of the largest security breaches of its kind. The newly disclosed victims could include customers whose data was obtained by Target prior to Black Friday. The company said Friday that as part of its ongoing probe.
The massive data heist at Target stores across the country was more massive than previously revealed, with the retailer saying at least 70 to 110 million customers were hit -- making it one of the largest security breaches of its kind.
The newly disclosed victims could include customers whose data was obtained by Target prior to Black Friday.
The company said Friday that as part of its ongoing probe it found information for at least 70 million people, apart from the 40 million payment card accounts previously disclosed, was stolen during the data breach. It said this is not a new breach. There may be some overlap between the two groups, Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman said, but it’s unclear by how much.
The stolen information includes names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses for up to 70 million individuals.
“I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,” said Gregg Steinfeld, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Target, in a statement on its website. “I also want our guests to know that understanding and sharing the facts related to this incident is important to me and the entire Target team.”
Target said that much of the data stolen is partial, but in situations where Target has an email address, it will attempt to contact the customers affected by the breach and provide them with tips to guard against consumer scams. Target said it will not ask customers for any personal information when it contacts them.
Even though the data is in bits and pieces, it means some of the previously disclosed stolen credit cards can be used to commit fraud in more places online.
In addition, it could be a precursor to more widespread identity theft.
“They steal and combine what was stolen in previous breaches,” said Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst at technology research company Gartner. “There are warehouses of information on people and dossiers. Now we’ve got John’s credit card, his address, his phone number… they do put it together and sell entire profiles on people.”
Attorneys general from New York and Massachusetts announced on Friday that they were joining a nationwide probe into the security breach.
Target initially reported in mid-December that about 40 million people who used credit or debit cards at its stores from November 27th to December 15th had their information compromised. At that time, the company said the information swiped from its systems included customers’ names, expiration dates, credit card numbers, and verification codes.
The breach was first reported by Krebs on Security, a data security blog. It occurred over some of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season, including Black Friday, and ran from Nov. 27 through Dec. 15, according to Target.
It added that customers will have no liability for the cost of any fraudulent charges. And it will offer one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for all customers who shopped in its stores.

Facebook Data Breaches: Full Timeline Through 2022
Source: Facebook Data Breaches: Full Timeline Through 2022 (firewalltimes.com)
The most recent Facebook data breach happened in April 2021, when personal data pertaining to 533 million Facebook users was made public on an online forum. This information, which included names, phone numbers, and more, was originally scraped using Facebook’s contact importer in 2019.
As far as we can tell, there have been no known Facebook breaches so far in 2022. Below, we’ll get into the full history of Facebook’s data breaches and privacy violations, starting with the most recent.
April 2021: Personal Data for Over 530 million Facebook Users Leaks in Online Forum
In April 2021, a trove of data pertaining to over 530 million Facebook users was publicly posted in an online hacking forum. The leaked data appears to have been scraped from Facebook in 2019, when a group of hackers exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s contact importer.
Back then, users could readily find people on Facebook by entering phone numbers into a contact importer. In violation of Facebook’s terms of service, hackers scraped users’ profile data by exploiting this tool. Most of the scraped data was tied to users’ phone numbers, and only 2.5 million email addresses were obtained.
Facebook fixed the vulnerability by September 2019. But they decided against notifying the 530 million users whose personal data had been scrapped.
In an internal memo, Facebook dismissed the incident as a data scraping issue, unavoidable for social media platforms: “We expect more scraping incidents and think it’s important to both frame this as a broad industry issue and normalize the fact that this activity happens regularly.”
As a result of this and other incidents, Facebook has come under pressure from the European Union for violating its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In October 2021, the Irish Data Protection Commission proposed a fine of up to 36 million euros for these data privacy violations.

June 2020: Facebook Accidentally Shares User Data with Third-Party Developers
In June 2020, Facebook engineers discovered an issue that enabled third-party developers to access personal data on users they should not have had access to. They promptly fixed the issue, and on July 1st, 2020, Facebook made the issue public via a blog post.
Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, Facebook had implemented a new policy that would only allow developers to access customer data within 90 days of using the developer’s app. But until Facebook discovered and fixed the issue, thousands of developers could still see data on inactive users if those inactive users were Facebook friends with someone who was an active user.
December 2019: Hacker Group Captures Data from 300+ Million Facebook Accounts
In December 2019, Facebook user data from approximately 267 million accounts was found unprotected on the dark web. The data included names, phone numbers, and Facebook IDs. Then, in March 2020, a second server was discovered that contained data on 42 million more users, bringing the total up to 309 million.
Both servers were associated with the same criminal group, a collection of hackers based in Vietnam. It’s believed that Facebook API abuse or illegal scraping were involved in the data capture.
This batch of stolen data came up for sale on the dark web again in April, 2020. Once data is exposed, it’s hard to put the genie back in the bottle.
September 2019: Data for 419 million Facebook Users Found on Exposed Server
An unsecured server holding personal data on 419 million Facebook users was found in September 2019. The server was publicly accessible, allowing potentially anyone to find the Facebook ID and phone number of the impacted user. In some cases, the user’s name, country location, and gender were also in the server records.
The server housing the data didn’t belong to Facebook, and it’s unclear who scraped the data to begin with. The server was eventually taken down.
July 2019: FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook
In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission began a renewed investigation of privacy violations at Facebook. And on July 24, 2019, the FTC announced a $5 billion fine and mandated a new round of requirements to bring Facebook in line.
To maintain oversight, the FTC mandated a restructuring at Facebook from the board-level down, as well as the creation of an independent privacy committee, with new privacy compliance officers at the company subject to this independent board.
This $5 billion penalty is the largest the FTC has ever imposed for privacy violations. The FTC chairman, Joe Simons, described the penalty as follows:
The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.
The 2019 penalty followed a previous FTC investigation that ended in a settlement in November, 2011. But Facebook did not abide by the terms of the 2011 settlement, leading to a renewed investigation and penalty in 2019.
April 2019: Facebook Uploads 1.5 million Users’ Email Contacts Without Permission
Between May 2016 and 2019, Facebook uploaded 1.5 million users’ email contacts without their permission. When the new user opened their account, Facebook asked the person to enter their email password to verify the email. Once that occurred, the person’s contacts’ email addresses were imported automatically, all without Facebook requesting permission or the option for the new user to cancel the process. From there, Facebook began using the information to improve ad targeting and recommend friends.
April 2019: 540 million Facebook User Records Found on Public Server
Researchers with the security firm UpGuard found approximately 540 million Facebook user records captured by app developers stored in an Amazon cloud public server, making the information accessible to the public through the internet. The data included Facebook IDs, account names, comments, reactions, likes, and more.
After the discovery, UpGuard reached out to Cultura Colectiva – the server hosting company – informing them about the unsecured data. Still, it took months before the server was ultimately secured, as no action was taken until Facebook became fully aware of the situation.
Facebook was not directly responsible for this breach, as it was the app developers who improperly stored the information. However, Facebook still bears responsibility over what happens on its platform – and in any case, they have pledged repeatedly not to share users’ information with outside companies.
March 2019: Up to 600 million Facebook Passwords Stored in Plaintext Files
In March 2019, a report found that as many as 600 million Facebook user passwords had been stored in plaintext files, some dating back as far as 2012. While only Facebook employees had access to those files, it meant that user passwords were fully exposed to approximately 2,000 employees.
Later, it was determined that millions of Instagram user passwords were also being stored in plaintext files, leaving them exposed as well. It is not clear if any of the password data was ever improperly used.
December 2018: New York Times Discovers Facebook Sharing User Data Without Permission
In December 2018, the New York Times released a report showing that Facebook had violated users’ consent on privacy. Even after Facebook promised the FTC it would not share user data without explicit permission, Facebook continued to sell users’ information to over 150 companies. Companies such as Netflix and Spotify could even read users’ so-called “private” messages.
In response, Facebook claimed that they considered the companies they shared data with to be extensions of Facebook itself, making this data sharing ‘exempt’ from the FTC’s requirements. This is a frankly ridiculous claim, unless you consider Netflix and Spotify to be part of Facebook (I do not).
Even while Facebook repeatedly promised users that they had control over their privacy, they continued to share highly private information without informing users or asking for their consent. That’s about as clear of a privacy violation as it gets.
September 2018: Attackers Access Data of Up to 90 million Facebook Users
Still reeling from the damage caused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was embroiled in another data breach. In September 2018, Facebook announced that attackers had accessed user data, allowing them to see the entire contents of user profiles.
The breach was able to occur due to a flaw in the platform’s “View As” feature. With that feature, users can view their profile as if they were another user, giving users insights into what other Facebook users could potentially see. An issue in the code gave attackers the ability to steal a user’s access tokens, giving them the ability to view profile information that may otherwise be private.
According to Facebook, the vulnerability went unnoticed for more than one year. Once spotted, the code issue was corrected, and impacted users’ access tokens were reset. In total, the attackers accessed profile data on anywhere from 50 to 90 million users.
May 2018: Facebook Bug Makes 14 million Users’ Private Posts Public
Facebook ostensibly gives users control over who can see their posts and their profile. Usually, users have the ability to make certain posts relatively private, limiting who can view the post to, for example, just specific individuals or those included in their list of friends on Facebook.
In May 2018, a glitch prevented the privacy settings from working correctly. As a result, 14 million users’ private posts were shared publicly even though they were initially posted with viewing limitations. These posts became public without users’ knowledge or consent.
The bug was reportedly related to a new feature Facebook was testing, which rolled out on May 18, 2018. The bug was identified fairly quickly, but a fix for the problem did not begin rolling out until May 22, and the bug was not fully resolved until May 27.
March 2018: Cambridge Analytica Scandal Affects 50+ Million Users
In its biggest privacy scandal to date, Facebook exposed data on 87 million users to the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. This firm got its data through Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge who had access via a quiz app.
Between 2013 and 2015, Cambridge Analytica exploited a loophole in Facebook’s API that enabled it to compile profile data not just from users who downloaded the app, but also from their friend networks. Although Facebook told developers they could not market or sell this kind of data, they did not enforce this policy, allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest and sell it for years without repercussions.
This was a major breach of user privacy, but it cannot really be considered a hack. Facebook knew Cambridge Analytica was misusing user data as far back as 2015, but Facebook refused to acknowledge any issue and did not act until the media raised the heat on its coverage in March 2018.
June 2013: Bug Exposes Personal Data of 6 million Users
In June 2013, news broke of a bug that exposed the sensitive personal data of approximately 6 million Facebook users. The glitch – which was related to the contact information archive – allowed the users’ email addresses and phone numbers to be viewed by unauthorized individuals.
The sensitive data was typically accessed by unauthorized people in error. When a user attempted to download contact information from the connections on their friends list, additional contact details that they were not authorized to view were added to the download.
Technically, the issue surrounding this breach is believed to have begun in 2012. However, the bug was not actually spotted until 2013. As a result, it was in place for about a year before a fix was issued.
January 2013: Facebook’s Graph Search Rollout Ignites Privacy Concerns
In January 2013, Facebook launched Graph Search, which enabled users to search for information on other users and groups. These searches could turn up information such as old comments, likes, and photos, which users might not want to be made publicly available.
Though this did not make any previously private information public, it made otherwise forgotten information much more discoverable, prompting many outlets to recommend users update their privacy settings.
November 2011: Facebook Settles with FTC on Privacy Charges
On November 29, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it arrived at a settlement with Facebook over Facebook’s failings to keep user data private. In a Facebook blog post, Mark Zuckerberg admitted the company had “made a bunch of mistakes.” This post appears to have been taken down, and I can no longer find it on Facebook’s corporate website as of September 2021.
The FTC finalized this settlement on August 10, 2012, following a public comment period. As part of the settlement, the FTC imposed several requirements on Facebook:
The settlement requires Facebook to take several steps to make sure it lives up to its promises in the future, including by giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings, by maintaining a comprehensive privacy program to protect consumers’ information, and by obtaining biennial privacy audits from an independent third party.
As this timeline shows, the 2011 settlement did not put to rest Facebook’s issues with user privacy. When Facebook discovered the Cambridge Analytica scandal, for instance, they did not notify the FTC or the affected users. The record shows that Facebook has not adequately complied with this 2011 settlement, and they have continued to face lawsuits and penalties from the FTC as a result.
May 2010: Facebook Shares User Data with Advertisers via “Privacy Loophole”
In May 2010, the Wall Street Journal found that Facebook had been sharing user data with advertisers without the consent of those users. After this so-called ‘privacy loophole’ came to light, Facebook stated that they did not consider the information involved to be personally identifiable – even though it included details such as a person’s name, age, and hometown.
At the time, Facebook said they closed this particular loophole. But as the timeline shows, it was one of many ways they shared user data with advertisers and other business partners without the clear consent of their users.
December 2009: Facebook Makes Previously Private User Information Public
In December 2009, Facebook made their big shift to a platform where users share information publicly, rather than with their select group of friends. As part of this transition, they converted millions of user profiles from private to public and implemented privacy controls that would supposedly allow users to control who could see their posts and other information.
December 2007: Beacon Advertising Program Allows Facebook User Tracking
When it comes to Facebook’s first big brush with widescale privacy concerns, the launch of Beacon – an advertising program – is likely it. Beacon had the ability to track user purchases on other sites and post about what was bought on Facebook, often without first getting permission from the user. After an outcry, Facebook added an opt-out option for Beacon.
We did not find any earlier records of data breaches or privacy violations involving Facebook.

Computer Program Used by Clinton Campaign Hacked as Part of DNC Cyber Attacks
Source: By Phil Helsel, Josh Meyer, and Jonathan Dienst (2016). (nbcnews.com)
The Clinton campaign said a data program was accessed, but said no evidence has been found its internal systems were compromised.
A computer data program used by Hillary Clinton’s campaign was hacked, the campaign said Friday in the latest revelation in a series of cyber-attacks on Democratic Party properties.
Reuters first reported the cyber attack, and said a computer network used by the Clinton campaign was hacked. Federal officials confirmed to NBC News that the Clinton campaign was hacked. The Clinton campaign said a program used by its campaign was breached, but it said no evidence has been found that the campaign’s internal systems were broken into.
“An analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack,” Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.
“Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,” Merrill said.
The FBI said Friday it is investigating. “The FBI is aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters,” the FBI said.
A Clinton aide said the hackers had access to had access to the analytics program’s server for approximately 5 days. The program is used to conduct voter analysis. It could not have been used to access internal campaign email or other communications or computers, the aide said, citing an outside security expert.
A spokesman for the Donald Trump campaign said Friday: “This seems to be a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasn’t classified or top-secret information that puts American lives at risk.”
News of the hack comes after cyber attacks on Democratic Party groups, including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s computer system.
The DCCC confirmed the hack Friday and said it was “similar” to the cyber attack on the DNC. The hack on the DNC has been blamed on the Russian government.
A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the FBI is investigating the intrusion on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s computer system but that agents have not yet found a link to the earlier DNC hack.
The Kremlin has denied it is behind either breach — and a top official responded to the allegations on Friday by denouncing a “poisonous anti-Russian” narrative coming out of Washington.
The disclosure that the DCCC was hacked escalated concern among U.S. national security officials that the intrusions are aimed at swaying the outcome of the presidential election.
The DCCC, which raises money for Democrats running for House seats, said in a statement that it has retained the forensic investigation firm CrowdStrike, which was also retained by the DNC. The firm concluded two Russian security agencies had hacked into its servers and internal files.
“Based on the information we have to date, we’ve been advised by investigators that this is similar to other recent incidents, including the DNC breach,” DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly said in a statement.
“The DCCC takes this matter very seriously. With the assistance of leading experts, we have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network in the face of these recent events. We are cooperating with the federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.”
Days before the Democratic convention that kicked off Monday, the website WikiLeaks published nearly 20,000 internal emails from Democratic National Committee officials.
Some of the emails appeared to show that some officials favored the Clinton campaign over her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. The emails inflamed suspicions among some Sanders supporters, and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced she would resign.
WikiLeaks did not say where it got the emails it released.
As NBC News reported this week, senior U.S. national security officials are confident that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC but have not determined if those agencies gave the material to WikiLeaks for the pre-convention email release.
Trump further fanned the flames of speculation when he seemed to invite Russia to release any Clinton emails they might have. The comments were condemned as extremely irresponsible in inviting the Russian government to commit espionage against the U.S.
Trump later called his remarks a “joke.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin has complimented Trump in recent weeks. Trump has in the past praised Putin.
Trump last week n an interview with The New York Times suggested that the U.S. would not necessarily defend new NATO members in the Baltics in the event of Russian attack if he were elected to the White House.
Trump said in the interview that doing so would depend on whether those countries had “fulfilled their obligations to us” in terms of their financial contributions to the alliance.
NATO was formed during the Cold War to protect nations from the then-Soviet Union. NATO’s treaty states that an attack on one member state constitutes an attack on all, a principle enshrined in Article 5 of the alliance’s treaty.

Pentagon data breach puts personal details of 30,000 staff at risk
Source: Pentagon data breach puts personal details of 30,000 staff at risk (bitdefender.com)
The Pentagon has admitted that up to 30,000 military workers and civilian personnel have had their personal information and credit card data exposed following a security breach.
The security breach occurred at a third-party vendor which provides travel management services to the Department of Defense.
The vendor, which has not as yet been publicly identified due to security concerns and ongoing contracts, was not however responsible for informing the Pentagon of the breach. Instead, it appears that the DoD’s own computer security team which discovered a breach had occurred.
According to an Associated Press report, it possible that the breach happened “some months ago,” and that further investigations may uncover that even more staffers were exposed.
The Department of Defense says that it has started notifying individuals affected by the security breach, and that those impacted will be offered prepaid identity theft monitoring services.
Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino issued a statement confirming the breach does not affect all staff who have used travel management services:
“The Department is continuing to gather additional information about the incident, which involves the potential compromise of personally identifiable information (PII) of DoD personnel maintained by a single commercial vendor that provided travel management services to the Department. This vendor was performing a small percentage of the overall travel management services of DoD.”
The one piece of good news is that it appears no classified material is likely to have been put at risk through the breach.
News of the breach does, however, come at an awkward time for the US Department of Defense which is currently smarting from a report issued last week by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO).
That report concluded that poor security has made next-generation weapons systems easy to hack.
In one case, it was reported that it was possible for unauthorized users to gain access to a weapons system within just one hour, and that the Pentagon was not following basic security practices such as changing default passwords.
“One test report indicated that the test team was able to guess an administrator password in nine seconds. Multiple weapon systems used commercial or open-source software, but did not change the default password when the software was installed.”
There have, of course, been US government data breaches that have affected a far larger number of individuals than the 30,000 estimated to be impacted in this latest incident.
But that does not make it any less important for organizations like the Department of Defense to consider not only how they best protect their systems, but also how well their third-party service suppliers are securing sensitive DoD data.

CAM4 Data Leak Exposes Personal Data of Millions of Users
Source: CAM4 Data Leak Exposes Personal Data of Millions of Users (bitdefender.com)
The digital world is once again tainted by a highly sensitive data leak that puts millions of users at risk of blackmail attempts, identity theft and fraud.
A team of security researchers led by Anurag Sen recently uncovered a leaky database from CAM4, a popular live-streaming adult website. Housed on a misconfigured Elasticsearch server, the unsecure database exposed around 7TB of personal information from platform users and members.
You can also check if your private data has been exposed online! Use Bitdefender’s Digital Identity Protection tool to see where you stand at the moment and what the internet knows about you.
Among the cluster of 10 billion records, the analysists discovered information of CAM4 users, including:

First and last names
Email addresses and password hashes
Country of origin and sign-up dates
Gender preference and sexual orientation
Device information
Miscellaneous user details such as spoken language
Usernames and user conversations
Payments logs including credit card type, amount paid and applicable currency
Transcripts of email correspondence
Inter-user conversations
Chat transcripts between users and CAM4
Token information
IP addresses
Fraud and Spam detection logs

After rounding up the personal information, the team was able to pinpoint 11 million records containing emails, 26.3 million containing passwords hashes, and less than 1,000 revealing full names, credit card types and amounts paid to view explicit content on the website.
“US, Brazilian and Italian users were the most heavily affected although the precise number of email records is difficult to gauge accurately due to multiple entries being duplicated,” said researchers.
“The fact that a large amount of email content came from popular domains such as Gmail, Hotmail and iCloud â€” domains that offer supplementary services such as cloud-storage and business tools â€” means that compromised CAM4 users could potentially see huge volumes of personal data including photographs, videos and related business information leaked to hackers â€” assuming their accounts were eventually hacked via phishing as one example,” they later added.
Although the database was immediately taken down by parent company Granity Entertainment, the logs date back to March 16, and cybercriminals could have already scraped the information.
Moreover, let’s not forget the Ashley Madison data breach scandal victims are still being targeted with blackmail and sextortion campaigns 5 years after the incident.
Given the sensitive nature of the exposed info, the aftermath of the recent data leak could have serious consequences, leaving CAM4 members vulnerable to targeted attacks and phishing emails. On top of any financial losses that may occur, victims can suffer damaging psychological effects, following multiple blackmail attempts or defamation.
Discuss the following: What happen here? (1) Was security neglected? (2) Who is responsible? (3) How could the breach be avoided? (4) Was security properly funded? (5) Is management at fault? (6) Should the victims be compensated? (7) Will the incident harm the company’s reputation? (8) Will customers lose confidence in the organization because of the breach? (9) How can customers protect their sensitive data in these cases?
