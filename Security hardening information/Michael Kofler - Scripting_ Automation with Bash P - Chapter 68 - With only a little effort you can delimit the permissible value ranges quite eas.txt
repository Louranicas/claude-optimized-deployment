# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Michael Kofler - Scripting_ Automation with Bash, PowerShell, and Python (2024, Rheinwerk Publishing) - libgen.li
Chapter: 68 - With only a little effort, you can delimit the permissible value ranges quite easily, in this case, to the years between 0000 and 2999, the months between 01 and 12, and the days between 0 and 31. The following expression is not perfect but at least prevents complete input errors:
[012]\d{3}-(0[1-9]|10|11|12)-([012]\d|30|31)

With only a little effort, you can delimit the permissible value ranges quite easily, in this case, to the years between 0000 and 2999, the months between 01 and 12, and the days between 0 and 31. The following expression is not perfect but at least prevents complete input errors:
[012]\d{3}-(0[1-9]|10|11|12)-([012]\d|30|31) 
9.2.6    Example: Recognizing IPv4 Addresses
You can also be more or less exact with IPv4 addresses. To extract IP addresses from a logging file, which will contain only correct addresses anyway, the following expression is sufficient:
(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3} 


\d{1,3} requires a 1- to 3-digit number.


\. requires a dot. Do not forget the preceding \ character. Just . allows any character!


(...){3} causes a tripling of this expression, so that it would capture "1.2.3." for IP address 1.2.3.
