Email Search:

Scenario: JIT Inc. must carry out a thorough investigation in response to a report of a suspicious email.
How It Assists: Email Search makes it possible for JIT Inc. to perform thorough log searches of emails, making it easier to look into particular emails or email addresses.

Implementation and Analysis

Continuous Monitoring: To quickly detect and address possible dangers, JIT Inc. continuously monitors these dashboards.
Incident Investigation and Response: JIT Inc. may investigate data more thoroughly when irregularities are found, enabling an efficient and timely incident response.
Enhancement of Network Security: By enhancing their protocols and security procedures, JIT Inc. is able to lower the danger of cyber threats thanks to the insights gathered from these dashboards.

The Protocol Intelligence dashboards from Splunk ES are crucial to JIT Inc.’s ability to keep a reliable and safe network environment. Through the use of these tools, JIT Inc. is able to keep a close eye on network activity, spot possible threats, and take proactive measures to protect the security and integrity of its network infrastructure.
To sum up, Splunk Enterprise Security’s protocol intelligence is crucial for tracking and analyzing network protocols, identifying risks and abnormalities based on protocols, investigating incidents, and increasing overall network security. By using protocol intelligence, organizations may proactively fix potential vulnerabilities and maintain a secure network environment.
Case Studies
Here are four case studies illustrating the successful use of Splunk in various intelligence domains: Web Intelligence, User Intelligence, Threat Intelligence, and Protocol Intelligence. These examples showcase how Splunk can help organizations enhance their security capabilities in different areas.
Case Study: Web Intelligence - E-commerce Company

Problem: An e-commerce company needs to monitor and analyze its web traffic to help detect and respond to potential cyber threats, such as DDoS attacks, web application attacks, and fraudulent transactions.
Solution: The company implemented Splunk in order to gain real-time visibility for its web traffic and application logs. By correlating and analyzing this data, Splunk enabled the company to detect unusual patterns and potential threats targeting its web applications and infrastructure.
Results: The e-commerce company successfully utilized Splunk’s web intelligence capabilities to improve its ability to detect and respond to cyber threats targeting its web applications. This led to a reduction in the number of successful attacks and improved the company’s overall security posture.

Case Study: User Intelligence - Financial Institution

Problem: A financial institution needed a solution to detect and respond to potential insider threats and unauthorized access attempts to its sensitive data and systems.
Solution: The financial institution used Splunk to monitor and analyze user behavior, including logins, file access, and system activities. Splunk’s user intelligence capabilities allowed the institution to identify suspicious activities and anomalies that could indicate potential insider threats or unauthorized access.
Results: By leveraging Splunk’s user intelligence capabilities, the financial institution significantly improved its ability to detect and respond to insider threats and unauthorized access attempts. This led to a more secure environment and reduced the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.

Case Study: Threat Intelligence - Healthcare Organization

Problem: A healthcare organization faced challenges in staying informed about the latest cyber threats targeting its industry and needed a solution to incorporate threat intelligence into its security operations.
Solution: The healthcare organization integrated Splunk with various threat intelligence feeds, such as those from commercial vendors and open-source platforms. Splunk correlated this threat intelligence data with the organization’s security logs, enabling the identification of potential threats and vulnerabilities in its environment.
Results: The healthcare organization successfully utilized Splunk’s threat intelligence capabilities to stay informed about the latest cyber threats and vulnerabilities. This enabled the organization to proactively address potential risks, ultimately improving its overall security posture.

Case Study: Protocol Intelligence - Manufacturing Company

Problem: A manufacturing company needs to monitor and analyze network traffic and protocols while detecting and responding to potential cyber threats targeting its industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) environments.
Solution: The manufacturing company implemented Splunk in order to gain real-time visibility in its network traffic and protocol data. By analyzing this data, Splunk allowed the company to identify potential threats and anomalies targeting its ICS and OT environments.
Results: By leveraging Splunk’s protocol intelligence capabilities, the manufacturing company significantly improved its ability to detect and respond to cyber threats targeting its ICS and OT environments. This led to a more secure environment and reduced the risk of disruption to its operations.

Conclusion
A comprehensive and successful cybersecurity plan requires a wide range of components, all of which fall under the category of security intelligence. We can measure and rank potential dangers using risk analysis, and we can learn a lot about user behavior and online-based activity via web and user intelligence. By spotting possible threats before they cause harm, threat intelligence makes proactive defense easier, while protocol intelligence helps keep the confidentiality of our electronic conversations intact. Each of these elements contributes significantly to strengthening an organization’s security posture.
This foundation will be built upon as we move into the following chapter, “Forensic Investigation in Security Domains,” and we’ll look at how these intelligence insights may be used to look into and respond to security issues while also boosting the resilience of our cybersecurity systems.
Points to Remember

Security intelligence focuses on gathering, analyzing, and disseminating data about potential threats, weaknesses, and incidents in the environment of an organization. It entails identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks, as well as putting in place the necessary safeguards to reduce or prevent them.
Real-time monitoring, detection, and response to security threats are made possible by security intelligence technologies and procedures.
Security dashboards and analytics solutions, like Splunk Enterprise Security, may help prioritize resources and offer insightful information about an organization’s security posture.
Key indicators are summaries of data that are displayed at the top of security dashboards, giving users a quick glimpse at the most crucial parameters.
Network traffic, DNS activity, SSL activity, and email activity may all be watched to spot any possible security problems like malware infestations, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access.
More specific information can be obtained by drilling down into particular events or metrics to help with incident response and investigation.
Effective security intelligence depends on properly configuring, maintaining, and updating security tools with the most recent threat intelligence.
Improving an organization’s overall security posture and increasing the efficacy of security intelligence initiatives can be achieved by establishing a strong security culture and regular personnel training.
A successful security intelligence approach must emphasize ongoing development and learning from mistakes. Organizations may stay ahead of new dangers by routinely assessing and upgrading their rules, procedures, and tools.

You will build a solid foundation in Security Essential if you keep these crucial ideas in mind as you study through this chapter.
