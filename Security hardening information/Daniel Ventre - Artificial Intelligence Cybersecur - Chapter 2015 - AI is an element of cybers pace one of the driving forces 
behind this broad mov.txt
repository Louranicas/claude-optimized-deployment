# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Daniel Ventre - Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Cyber Defence Book (2020) - libgen.li
Chapter: 2015 - AI is an element of cybers pace, one of the driving forces 
behind this broad movement of continuous expansion. But even before 
thinking about its transformative capabiliti es – will AI have such a profound 
impact on cyberspace that it will cha nge its nature? – it is worth observing 
how AI fits into cyberspace, alongside all the pre-existing bricks and mortar. 
Before we think of “transformation” or  even “revolution”, we must think of 
“contribution” and “adaptation”. 
AI is “cyber” in its own right, b ecause it exists only through software, 
programming languages, computers, microchips and the data it feeds on and 
produces. AI is a scientific discipline and a set of techniques that originated 
at the same time as computers, at the end of World War II, in the United 
States, before spreading to the rest of the world. The histories of AI, 
computers, computing and cyberspace will continue to be closely linked. 
Paradoxically, however, today’s treatment of AI gives the impression that 
there are two distinct concepts. Ar ticles, books, colloquia, organizations, 
doctrines and defense strategies, to name but a few, seem to separate AI and 
“cyber”, with one exception: when  AI is understood as a set of new 
techniques in the field of cybersecurity. In our view, however, AI should be 
entirely included in cyberspace, of which it is only one of the bricks. It 
should therefore be seen as a component that will be part of a pre-existing 
whole, on which it will have an impa ct, but whose nature and possibilities 
will also be constrained by this pre-existing environment: 
“No doubt you have been deluged with a flood of reports about 
AI/ES1. Almost simultaneously, you have read that it will 
revolutionize the way you do business […] If you are like most 
members of senior management whom we have surveyed, you 
are intrigued by the possibilities of this powerful new tool but 
are too busy, intimidated, or simply unable to discern the truth. 
But you should, because the bottom line implications are 
staggering.” [GIL 85]
