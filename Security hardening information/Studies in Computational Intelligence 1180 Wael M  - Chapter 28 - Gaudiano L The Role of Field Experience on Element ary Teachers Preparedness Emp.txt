Machine Learning Approaches 
for Sentiment Analysis on Social Media 
Reham Alhejaili 
Abstract Sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing, 
and it involves evaluating attitudes, opinions, and  emotions related to different enti-
ties. However, most research on sentiment analysis has been focused on English, 
leaving a gap for more diverse language studies, es pecially in Arabic. The preva-
lence of behaviors such as sharing private messages , spreading rumors, and making 
sexual comments has drawn signiﬁcant attention due to their severe negative social 
consequences. Detecting bullying texts or messages on social media has become 
a fundamental interest for researchers worldwide. T his study focuses on creating 
an efﬁcient online method to identify abusive and b ullying messages by combining 
natural language processing (NLP) with machine lear ning. The research assesses the 
performance of different machine learning algorithm s using frequency-inverse docu-
ment frequency (TFI_DF). This chapter delves into s igniﬁcant research on sentiment 
analysis of Arabic text using deep learning algorit hms. It offers a detailed exami-
nation of Sentiment analysis to detect cyberbullyin g, outlining the methodologies 
employed for data collection, preprocessing, and an alysis. An extensive literature 
review identiﬁed research gaps and practical techni ques for cyberbullying detec-
tion across various languages, highlighting signiﬁc ant potential for advancement 
in Arabic. Consequently, this research evaluates sp eciﬁc machine learning algo-
rithms for classifying Arabic datasets obtained fro m Twitter (now known as X). The 
Machine learning algorithms under investigation inc lude Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), Support Vector Classiﬁer (SVC), Naïve Bayes (NB), Multinominal Naïve 
Bayes (MNB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regressio n (LR), Gradient Boosting 
(GBoost), K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Adaptive Boosti ng (AdaBoost), Decision 
Tree (DT) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), selected for their proven 
effectiveness in similar contexts. These algorithms ’ performance was measured 
using well-established metrics such as accuracy, pr ecision, recall, and F1-score. RF 
emerged as the top performer with an accuracy of 80 .9%, showing promise compared

1 Introduction 
Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, s ystematically identiﬁes, extracts, 
and quantiﬁes the emotional tone of subjective data . Social networking platforms 
have become the primary venue for young people’s so cial interactions. However, 
the widespread issue of cyberbullying on these digi tal platforms poses a signiﬁcant 
and urgent threat to their well-being. According to  data from the White House and 
the American Psychological Association, over 40% of  American teenagers have 
experienced cyberbullying on social media platforms  [1]. Similarly, recent studies 
from the UK highlight the severity of the issue, re vealing that cyberbullying is more 
prevalent than physical bullying, with 12% of stude nts reporting such incidents [ 2]. 
The frequency of cyberbullying incidents is increas ing annually, presenting a 
complex issue with diverse motivations, methods, an d manifestations. This escalating 
problem severely impacts the physical and mental he alth of victims, sometimes 
leading to suicidal thoughts. Beyond individual eff ects, cyberbullying has emerged 
as a signiﬁcant public health concern, prompting in creased research in psychology 
and computer science. This study aims to understand  the nature of cyberbullying and 
develop effective strategies to detect and address it on social networks [ 3]. 
In the context of automated cyberbullying detection , where harmful verbal attacks 
are prevalent, current efforts mainly focus on anal yzing textual features. Various 
methods have been developed to classify text and id entify instances of cyberbullying, 
deﬁned as the repeated posting of offensive or viol ent content on social media by 
individuals or groups with the intent to harm or up set others [ 4]. However, relying 
solely on textual analysis presents challenges in d etermining whether the content 
targets speciﬁc individuals or groups without conte xtual information. Additionally, 
inappropriate visual content within traditional tex t-based material adds another risk 
on social media platforms. Therefore, it is essenti al to incorporate diverse types 
of social media data, such as images, videos, comme nts, and social networks, into 
cyberbullying detection efforts [ 5]. The potential of multi-modal data integration 
offers hope for more effective cyberbullying detect ion in the future. 
Current approaches that focus on multi-modal inform ation often prioritize speciﬁc 
modalities. Comments and visual content, for exampl e, can provide valuable context 
that text alone cannot capture. Combining these dif ferent types of data could lead to 
more accurate and robust detection systems, which a re beneﬁcial and mandatory for 
effectively identifying and mitigating cyberbullyin g [6]. 
One study aimed [ 7] to enhance the understanding of context and behav ior by 
utilizing contextual information. However, it did n ot account for the interaction
Machine Learning Approaches for Sentiment Analysis on Soci al Media 23
between individual comments while analyzing their c orrelation. In contrast, on other 
study the authors [ 8] introduced a method incorporating visual elements  to address the 
limitations of text-only analysis. While these meth ods outperform text analysis alone, 
they still need to improve in overcoming the constr aints of single-mode informa-
tion. Additionally, cyberbullying exhibits persiste nt and recurring hostile behavior, 
as highlighted by Agoston et al. [ 9]. Addressing conversations about cyberbullying 
without causing further harm presents a challenge, necessitating rapid detection of 
multi-modal bullying content to prevent further dis cussions. 
To tackle these evolving forms of sentiment analysi s to detect cyberbullying, we 
propose a method that integrates textual, visual, a nd additional meta-information to 
determine if a post is related to bullying. Our Cyb erbullying Machin learning Detec-
tion used to address these challenges. We suggest i dentifying offensive comments in 
blogs associated with cyberbullying. The textual co ntent features are used to improve 
cyberbullying detection performance. The main contr ibutions of this work include 
introducing a fresh perspective on problem-solving by leveraging and processing 
NLP to effectively manage different types of cyberb ullying. We have applied (ML) 
techniques for detecting cyberbullying that indepen dently analyzes textual, visual, 
and other forms of information. By integrating thes e components, we achieve efﬁcient 
information merging, which aids in resolving the co mplex issue of cyberbullying 
more effectively. 
We also collected data from prominent social media platforms, including Twitter, 
to validate our methodology. Furthermore, we thorou ghly analyzed how the data 
impacts cyberbullying detection, ensuring that our approach is practical. 
This chapter provides a focused study evaluates mac hine learning classiﬁers used 
in detecting cyberbullying, examining their perform ance based on accuracy, preci-
sion, recall, and F1 score. The primary contributio ns of this work include an exten-
sive review of quality papers to identify widely us ed machine learning methods for 
cyberbullying detection on social media platforms a nd an evaluation of these classi-
ﬁers’ usability and accuracy on a large, generic da taset. We developed an automated 
detection model incorporating feature extraction to  enhance classiﬁer efﬁciency. We 
compared the performance of seven commonly used ML classiﬁers for cyberbullying 
detection, utilizing Frequency-Inverse Document Fre quency (TF-IDF) for feature 
extraction. This comparison helped us to understand  the strengths and weaknesses 
of (ML) text classiﬁcation models. Our research aim s to address the following ques-
tions: What machine-learning techniques are extensiv ely used for detecting cyber-
bullying on social media platforms? How can an auto matic cyberbullying detection 
model be developed with high accuracy and minimal p rocessing time? How can 
feature extraction improve the detection process?

2 Related Studies 
Over recent years, signiﬁcant studies have been mad e in the detection of cyber-
bullying, offering hope for controlling or reducing  its prevalence on social media 
platforms. Cyberbullying is particularly troubling as victims often struggle to cope 
with the emotional burden of violent, intimidating,  degrading, and hostile messages. 
Addressing the harmful effects of cyberbullying req uires comprehensive studies on 
its detection, prevention, and mitigation [ 10]. 
The Arabic language presents unique challenges for cyberbullying detection due to 
its complex morphology, rich vocabulary, and numero us dialects. Written from right 
to left, Arabic includes diacritics that can signiﬁ cantly alter word meanings. Addi-
tionally, its morphology allows for creating new wo rds through various inﬂections, 
complicating the detection of abusive language. The  diversity of Arabic dialects, 
ranging from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to region al colloquial varieties, further 
complicates the task of automatic text processing a nd cyberbullying detection [ 1, 2]. 
Arabic sentiment analysis encounters several signiﬁ cant challenges. Firstly, the 
morphological complexity of the language is a major  hurdle. Arabic words undergo 
extensive transformations due to the root-based str ucture, which involves deriving 
words from roots through various afﬁxes and inﬂecti ons. This technique necessi-
tates advanced preprocessing techniques to effectiv ely normalize and stem words, 
demanding a deep understanding of the language’s st ructure and context [ 3]. 
Secondly, dialectal variation poses a problem, as A rabic comprises numerous dialects 
with distinct expressions and slang. For instance, the word for ‘good’ differs between 
‘zain’ in Levantine dialect and ‘jayyid’ in Modern Standard Arabic. This variability 
complicates the use of machine learning models trai ned on one dialect for others, 
making it essential for sentiment analysis models t o specialize in speciﬁc dialects or 
handle multiple dialects simultaneously [ 4]. Lastly, the need for high-quality anno-
tated data further challenges sentiment analysis ef forts. The training and validation 
of machine learning models are hindered by the limi ted availability of large, labeled 
datasets, which are essential for effective general ization. It is crucial to address this 
shortage to advance Arabic sentiment analysis [ 5].

2.1 Natural Language Processing 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has a long histor y and draws from multiple 
ﬁelds to help computers work with human language by  analysing different aspects 
of text. Its roots go back to the late 1940s, when efforts in Machine Translation began, 
marking the start of attempts to automate language translation. Over the years, NLP 
has expanded to cover many applications for analysi ng and understanding text. 
NLP is a compelling area of computer science that p lays an increasingly vital 
role in everyday life. It powers virtual assistants  like Siri and Alexa and language 
translation services. The main goal of NLP is to br idge the gap between computers
Machine Learning Approaches for Sentiment Analysis on Soci al Media 25
and human language, aiming to create systems that c an understand and process 
language on their own. Its many applications highli ght its growing importance in 
today’s world. 
Arabic, the fourth most widely used language online , showcases how essential 
NLP is in enabling communication across different l anguages. Nearly 400 million 
people in 22 countries speak Arabic, which includes  classical Arabic, which is mostly 
used in literature, ofﬁcial documents, and religiou s texts like the Quran. Modern 
Standard Arabic, which developed from Classical Ara bic, is used in formal commu-
nication, while a range of regional dialects is spo ken in everyday conversations. 
These dialects vary widely and lack a standardized format [ 11]. 
Arabic’s complex structure and variety of dialects present speciﬁc challenges. 
Its right-to-left script and lack of capitalization  cause the shape of letters to change 
based on their position in a word. These challenges  require specialized methods to 
address the language’s detailed structure and featu res [12]. 
These techniques are not just theoretical, they hav e practical uses in many areas. 
For instance, in information retrieval, they extrac t important information from large 
datasets. In text summarization, they condense long  documents and provide accurate 
answers to user questions. These methods are crucia l for making virtual assistants, 
search engines, and translation tools work smoothly , improving their efﬁciency and 
user experience. They also handle tasks like conver ting printed or handwritten text 
into digital form (optical character recognition), identifying word boundaries, clar-
ifying word meanings in context (word sense disambi guation), and turning spoken 
language into text [ 13]. 
Key areas of focus include analysing speech sounds (Acoustic–Phonetic anal-
ysis), studying word structures and sentence format ion (Morphological-Syntactic 
analysis), and interpreting meaning within broader contexts (Semantic-Pragmatic 
analysis). These methods help bridge the gap betwee n human language and digital 
systems, driving technological and research innovat ion [14]. 
2.2 Machine Learning Approaches for Cyberbullying 
Detection 
Recent advances in machine learning have provided v aluable tools for improving how 
we analyse sentiment, especially when detecting cyb erbullying. These techniques are 
now being applied to Arabic, a more complex languag e with challenges. Below are 
some signiﬁcant methods used to detect cyberbullyin g in Arabic [ 15]:
