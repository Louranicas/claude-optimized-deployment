Kali ships with a default user account named kali whose password is kali.


Figure 3-1: The Kali login screen

After logging in to Kali, you need to make sure it’s up to date. To access the terminal, open the Applications menu, and in the search bar, enter terminal emulator. Click the corresponding application.
Let’s use a few commands to update your software repositories and upgrade your installed packages. In the terminal window, enter the following commands:
$ sudo apt update -y
$ sudo apt upgrade -y
$ sudo apt dist-upgrade -y

When you use sudo, Kali will ask for your password. This is the same password you used to log in to the virtual machine, kali.
Newer Kali releases use the Z Shell (zsh) by default, so ensure that bash is the default shell for the kali user with this command:
$ sudo usermod --shell /bin/bash kali
Next, enable your new default shell by running the following command:
$ su - kali
Moving forward, we’ll use this Kali machine for all tasks we cover in the book. We recommend keeping the terminal window open, as you’ll need it for additional installations very soon.


The Target Environment
Now it’s time to install the machines and networks that will make up the simulated target. You can perform this installation in two ways: manually or with an automated script.
We encourage you to set up your lab manually at least once by following the instructions in this section. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the lab’s core components and practice running commands on the command line. However, if you ever need to redeploy the lab from scratch in a fresh installation of Kali, you can do so by cloning the repository at https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-Bash and running make init:
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-Bash.git
$ cd ./Black-Hat-Bash/lab
$ sudo make init

This script should install all the lab’s dependencies, containers, and hacking utilities, enabling you to skip the instructions in this section and in “Installing Additional Hacking Tools” on page
