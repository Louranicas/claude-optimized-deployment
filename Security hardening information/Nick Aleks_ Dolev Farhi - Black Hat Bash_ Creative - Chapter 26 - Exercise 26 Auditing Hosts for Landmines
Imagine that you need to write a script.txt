Chapter: 26 - Exercise 26: Auditing Hosts for Landmines
Imagine that you need to write a script to download malicious code from the internet and onto a compromised machine. Before the script executes the download, it should understand the compromised host’s runtime environment and halt its operation if any security tools are found.
In this exercise, you’ll implement such a script. Table 12-1 provided predefined heuristics you can use to identify security tools. For example, when installed, Tripwire creates a directory under /etc/tripwire, while syslog servers generally run using specific process names, such as rsyslog or syslog-ng. At a high level, your script should be able to do the following:
