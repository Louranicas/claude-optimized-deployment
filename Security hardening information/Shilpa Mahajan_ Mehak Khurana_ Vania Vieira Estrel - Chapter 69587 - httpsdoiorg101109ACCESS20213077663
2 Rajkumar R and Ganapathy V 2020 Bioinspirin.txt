10.1 Introduction
Big data has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its great potential and ability to solve problems associated with large amounts of data. The tourism industry is one of the industries that seeks to improve business processes using the concept of big data. How tourism researchers use this data, and this new type of data may be part of a new research paradigm that requires new methods that improve the theoretical understanding of tourism. It’s time to find out. So far, online data sources are mainly used for application research. It provides (often free) data that provides insights into the travel/tourism industry and its customer activities. It is not surprising that previous research has focused on business strategy development, innovation and product development, and marketing activities.
The concept of tourism satisfaction is important in the context of the tourism industry, as it is a service‐oriented industry that relies on positive emotions and feedback from the customer. Satisfaction as a theoretical structure has long been explored and discussed, and there are many tools to manipulate and measure it.
Online review data is an important part of Tourism Big Data, which directly reflects the true feelings of tourists, so it has been widely researched. The role of big data in tourism is reflected in two key aspects. On the other hand, the big data of the tourism sector is optimistic for the transformation of the tourism sector and has a major impact on the healthy and rapid growth of the tourism sector. On the other hand, the tourism industry has big data on the potential to contribute to the innovation of tourism management tools. “Sentiment Analysis” automatically determines the emotional trajectory of ideas by targeting textual ideas.
There are two main branches of emotion analysis methods: machine learning‐based emotion analysis and semantic method‐based emotion analysis. There are several text classification methods, such as text classification using neural network methods. It has been pointed out that online reviews of tourist sites affect the confidence of tourists and stimulate their purchase demand. Text emotion polarity classification based on semantic features and binary models for Weibo conceptual data analysis. In addition, applications for data processing and emotion analysis are gradually being developed in the tourism industry.
Established the shortcomings of machine learning‐based emotion analysis methods in travel review analysis, and established a semantic dictionary‐based emotion analysis model. Effectively improving the management performance of travel appraisal reports. A sentimental analysis model to help improve service quality and image marketing in tourist areas.
Deep Learning (DL) methods have the advantage of automatically extracting features from data. Current tourism studies based on in‐depth learning techniques have explored the travel experience of budget hotels, target image identification, and review classification. Although the DL method is used for the tourism sector. Therefore, this study reviews feature‐level perception analysis performed by in‐depth learning techniques, compares the performance of in‐depth learning models, and explores the model training process.

Taking into account the impact of this virtual entertainment site, the examination of Twitter content has turned into a piece of exploration as it gives helpful bits of knowledge on the subject. Travel surveys are an extraordinary way for vacationers to find out about movement locations. Sadly, a few remarks are improper and the information is clear. Highlight‐based feeling grouping strategies have been demonstrated to be promising in clamor concealment. Close‐to‐home investigation is acquiring and more consideration as a significant field of normal language handling [10]. In scholarly evaluation, opinion examination assists teachers with distinguishing understudies’ actual sentiments about courses as soon as possible, to change educational plans in an opportune and exact way, and to work on the nature of training [11].
Various posts on these virtual entertainments are distributed every day and seen by general society [12]. Obviously, long‐range interpersonal communication media can straightforwardly impact individuals’ perspectives on a specific subject. This information can be utilized for significant data, which can assist organizations with understanding what patterns or opinions [13]. The quantity of these day‐to‐day produced signs have developed dramatically and thus there is a colossal measure of data addressing a huge piece of the new world called Big Data [14]. This huge information is utilized by an assortment of undertakings to pursue showcasing choices, track explicit ways of behaving, or remove important data to recognize [15]. Sentiment Analysis (SA) is perhaps the most dynamic area of exploration.
