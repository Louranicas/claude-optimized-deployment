This remote address belongs to the host on which you ran Netcat (in this case, Kali).


Firewall Rules
Host firewall rules are also a source of network information. A firewall table may include rules that block certain networks or individual IP addresses from communicating with the host. This information can teach us about other nearby networks, servers, or clients.
A common host firewall found on Linux servers is iptables. Let’s run the following iptables command to see the rules configured on p-web-01 (172.16.10.10):
$ iptables -L --line-numbers  -v

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source      destination
  1      0     0 DROP       all  --  any    any     10.1.0.0/24 anywhere    /* Block Network */

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source      destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source      destination

As you can see, a rule blocks the network 10.1.0.0/24 from connecting to the p-web-01 box; this is another indication that an adjacent network at 10.1.0.0/24 exists. Note that reading the rule table with the iptables command usually requires elevated permissions.


Network Interface Configuration Files
Network interfaces may have dedicated configuration files that, for example, configure a network IP address statically for a specific interface or ensure that a network card is enabled on boot by default. Linux distributions can place their network configurations in different places, but you’ll commonly find them in the following locations: /etc/network/interfaces, /etc/network/interfaces.d/, /etc/netplan/, /lib/netplan/, /run/netplan/, and /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/.
If configured statically, network interfaces can shed light on the DNS servers in use. Network interfaces can also provide information such as the IP scheme, gateway addresses, and more. Here is a static network configuration file available in later versions of Ubuntu-based Linux systems:
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [172.16.10.0/24]
     gateway4: 172.16.10.1
     nameservers:
       addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]

This file configures the eth0 network interface with a default gateway of 172.16.10.1, as well as Google DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.
