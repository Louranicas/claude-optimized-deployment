Chapter: 1 - At that point we mentioned that the knowledge base includes a series of mitigations that are associated to attack techniques. These mitigations are security concepts and classes of technologies that one can use to prevent an attack technique from being successfully executed. Since mitigations are core components of any defense strategy, we will consider them in more detail here.There are currently 43 mitigations in the ATT&CK knowledge base, and we display in Table 6.8 a selection of 10 representative mitigations for illustration purposes, with focus on the network domain. It can be seen from our example that some mitigations, such as Software Configuration, refer to best practices regarding configuration and settings. Others, such as Exploit Protection, relate to best practices regarding defense mechanisms. Finally, some mitigations, such as Application Developer Guidance, refer to best practices regarding personnel training.Table 6.8Selected mitigations from the ATT&CK knowledge baseNameMitigation descriptionApplication Developer GuidanceThis mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage ofApplication Isolation and SandboxingRestrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint systemEncrypt Sensitive InformationProtect sensitive information with strong encryptionExploit ProtectionUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurringFilter Network TrafficUse network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering.

6.3.1.4 Cyber Analytics RepositoryThe Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) [7], which is also made available by MITRE Corporation, is a knowledge base of analytics that were developed as mechanisms for detecting the adversary behaviors described in the ATT&CK knowledge base. Consequently, the information included in the CAR repository is greatly relevant from an attack detection perspective.The procedure that was taken to develop the CAR analytics involves the following four steps: 1.Identify and prioritize the adversary behaviors that should be addressed. 2.Identify what data is necessary to detect those adversary behaviors. 3.Identify or create a “sensor” utility for collecting the necessary data. 4.Develop the analytic used to detect the identified adversary behaviors. 
For each CAR analytic, the ATT&CK techniques it refers to, possible implementation solutions, and the applicable platforms are described. Currently, there are about 100 entries in the analytics database. However, CAR contains not only analytics, but also a model to represent the observable data used to run the analytics, as well as information about sensor utilities that can be used to collect that data. All these are extremely useful instruments from a defense training perspective.

6.3.2 Defense Methodology GuidelinesFrom an organization perspective, cyber defense is the most important aspect in relation with cybersecurity. Consequently, government institutions have taken the necessary steps to create guidelines that organizations can use to make sure their cyber defense activities are as effective as possible. This is because, only by following standard methodologies an organization can ensure that it is taking a thorough and correct approach to address potential cyber threats. Next, we will introduce two examples of such guidelines that readers can refer to for this purpose.6.3.2.1 NIST Cybersecurity FrameworkThe U.S. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a guideline regarding the management of cybersecurity risks that provides a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by organizations to understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate their cybersecurity efforts [11]. While the framework does not contain technical information on how these outcomes are to actually be achieved in practice, several relevant resources are provided alongside CSF to help in this context in an online, regularly updated form:Informative References: Links to sources of guidance regarding each outcome that were selected among relevant global standards, guidelines, frameworks, regulations, policies, etc.Implementation Examples: Practical advice that explains potential ways in which each outcome can be achieved, expressed in a concise, action-oriented manner.
The essential part of CSF is represented by the CSF Core taxonomy, whose components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome in a manner that is independent from business sector, country, and technology aspects. This makes it possible for organizations to address their unique risks, technologies, and mission considerations. For the component description that follows, we will rely on the content of CSF 2.0, released in February 2024.Functions At the top of the CSF framework are the functions, which are the representation at the highest level of the desired cybersecurity outcomes. For each function, a unique alphabetic identifier, and a description of the function meaning are provided. Table 6.10 summarizes the CSF functions, and specifies the number of categories for each function. Note that the Govern function is new in CSF 2.0, and is conceived as an all-encompassing function that informs how an organization will implement the other five ones.Table 6.10Overview of the functions in the CSF 2.0 frameworkNameFunction descriptionCountGovernThe organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored6IdentifyThe organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood3ProtectSafeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used5DetectPossible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed2RespondActions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken4RecoverAssets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored2
Categories Each CSF function includes a number of categories that provide a more detailed description of the expected outcomes for various aspects of that function. For example, the Protect (PR) function includes the categories shown in Table 6.11, ranging from asset management and training to infrastructure resilience, which are all important aspects of safeguarding an organization.Table 6.11Overview of the categories for the Protect function in the CSF 2.0 frameworkNameCategory descriptionCountIdentity Management, Authentication, and Access ControlAccess to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users, services, and hardware and managed commensurate with the assessed risk of unauthorized access6Awareness and TrainingThe organization’s personnel are provided with cybersecurity awareness and training so that they can perform their cybersecurity-related tasks2Data SecurityData are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information4Platform SecurityThe hardware, software (e.g., firmware, operating systems, applications), and services of physical and virtual platforms are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy to protect their confidentiality, integrity, and availability6Technology Infrastructure ResilienceSecurity architectures are managed with the organization’s risk strategy to protect asset confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and organizational resilience4
Subcategories At the lowest level in CSF are subcategories, with each CSF category containing a number of such subcategories. The role of subcategories is to establish more practical controls that make it possible to assess the cybersecurity posture of an organization from a specific point of view. Subcategories do not have names, just alphabetic identifiers, but a description is provided for each of them.For instance, the Platform Security (PR.PS) category includes the subcategories shown in Table 6.
