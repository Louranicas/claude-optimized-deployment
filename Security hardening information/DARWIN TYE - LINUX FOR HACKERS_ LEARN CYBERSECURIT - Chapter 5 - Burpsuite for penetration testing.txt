Understanding Linux and Installing Your Favorite Linux Distro















Introduction





If you are
 a beginner you might be probably wondering what Linux is? Let me help you with the basic stuff. Linux is an operating system just like windows and MacOS but with more security and stability and customizability. And you know what? It is completely free and is open-source (that means source code is not hidden or encrypted).
Seems awesome right? But you might wonder why Linux is less popular among normal users. Linux is an operating system that is specifically developed by professionals for professionals. It offers very less creative software when compared to Windows and macOS. You can't find a photoshop version for Linux because Adobe thinks that Linux is not a platform that developers use to create their products.
Then, you may wonder who uses Linux as a daily work machine?
Linux may not be a creative operating system but is definitely a preferred choice by developers , programmers, ethical and unethical hackers, database system managers and system administrators. Linux is complex and definitely has a learning curve. Linux enthusiasts should be aware of commands and particularly an in-depth understanding of shell programming to achieve what they want using the Linux kernel.
Are you overwhelmed by the possibilities of Linux? Don't worry because we are here to help you introduce Linux with simple explanations and instructions. Welcome to the first module of this book where you will get a simple introduction to the Linux ecosystem and a detailed step-by-step installation instructions. Let us go!

Initially we will talk about some of the applications of Linux in everyday life.
Current status and trends of Linux in various fields
Many novices have a very confusing question:


"I have heard of Linux, but after learning the Linux system, what can you do on it? Or what can the Linux system specifically do?"


With this question, the book begins with an overview of Linux and its relationship with open source software. We will also talk about application fields and future development trends of Linux.
Linux and open source software
Linux is a free and open source UNIX-like operating system. The kernel of this operating system was first released by Linus Torvalds in
