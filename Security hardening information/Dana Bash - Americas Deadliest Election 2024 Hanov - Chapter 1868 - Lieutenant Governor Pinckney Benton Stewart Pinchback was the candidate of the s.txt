Chapter: 1868 - Lieutenant Governor Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback was the candidate of the so-called Pinchback wing of the Republican party. D. B. Penn led the Liberal Republican ticket, and the Reform party named George Williamson.
The horse trading began almost immediately as the various parties looked to partner for power. Bargains were struck. Deals were made. Warmoth didn’t have sufficient support to win an election, but combined with another party’s voters, he could swing an election. Under his direction the Liberal Republicans allied with the Democrats to form a fusion ticket supporting McEnery for governor and Penn for lieutenant governor. It was widely believed that the price McEnery paid for the support was an agreement to make Warmoth a senator. Warmoth did his best to calm those from both parties who felt betrayed, telling them that although he “hated” Democrats, “prejudices and bickerings must be laid aside... If I can forget my own, you ought to lay aside yours.” Although some Democrats refused to support any alliance in which Warmoth was involved, the mainstream party swallowed its pride for a chance of victory.
Detractors began referring to supporters of this union as “last ditchers,” a nickname that originally referred to Confederates who continued fighting when hope was gone, standing and dying in the “last ditch.”
Meanwhile, Pinchback made a deal with the Custom House, agreeing to back Kellogg for governor in return for a nomination to Congress. Williamson withdrew, saying that the only real chance for reform of Louisiana politics lay with the election of “the honest and intelligent” Kellogg.
The nominations were set: for president, Republican U. S. Grant faced quasi-Democrat/Liberal Republican Horace Greeley. For governor of Louisiana, Democrat John McEnery ran against Republican William P. Kellogg.
It is a cliché to say that the future is always on the ballot, but in this case it was the present that was at stake. The fighting of the War Between the States was done; the chaos it left in its immediate aftermath was done. Reconstruction had been imposed and mostly failed. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments had been ratified. Although the bitterness and hatred had not faded—the wounds were too deep and too raw for any real forgiveness on either side—voters were looking to their future rather than still fighting in the past.
The elections of 1868 had taken place in the ruins of the war. The makeshift political system throughout the South was fragile and dominated by newly arrived carpetbaggers. In many places Confederates had not been allowed to vote. The leader of the Union army had been rewarded with the presidency.
In Louisiana, the ’68 campaign had been marked by violence and fraud. There had been acceptable excuses: there were tens of thousands of first-time voters, there were problems setting up a viable voting structure—including questions about everything from registration eligibility to casting ballots—and there had been disputes about how to count the votes, but the failures in every aspect of the system had left many people doubtful about the results.
There had been numerous changes made in each aspect of process following that election. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Constitutional Amendments, which granted freedmen citizenship and the right to vote, were now law. Warmoth’s registration bills supposedly had addressed some of the confusion created by those Amendments. Confederate veterans were required to take a loyalty oath before their voting rights were restored.
The contrast in party platforms was clear. As any incumbent, Grant was running on his record. Among his accomplishments, he had instituted Reconstruction policies to bring the country together, had successfully overseen three Amendments added to the Constitution and founded a federal Department of Justice to protect the rights of all Americans. Southerners believed Grant’s Reconstruction policies had crippled their economic recovery and his Department of Justice was formed to encroach on states’ rights. Greeley strongly opposed Grant’s policies. He did not equivocate, saying, “All the political rights and franchises lost through our late bloody convulsion...must be promptly restored and re-established.”
By extension, the question of the right of states to make their own laws versus the obligation of the federal government to protect and defend all American citizens—which had remained unresolved since the ink dried on the Constitution—was also on the ballot. All Southerners had to do was look around to see the bluecoats still stationed in the region. Once again, Greeley did not hold back: “Subject to our solemn constitutional obligations to maintain the equal rights of all citizens our policy should aim at local self-government and not at centralization.”
Some newspapers even wondered why an electoral college system was used to vote for president rather than allowing people to vote directly, suggesting it heavily favored larger northern states. Southern-born presidents Andrew Jackson and Andrew Johnson had recommended dissolving the electoral college and, as the Times-Picayune reminded readers, only a year earlier Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner had introduced “a joint resolution proposing to establish by an amendment of the constitution a new mode of choosing the president.” The direct election of the president by popular vote would put the election in the hands of the people rather than “caucuses of politicians.”
The differences between Kellogg and McEnery were just as obvious. Senator Kellogg had not pursued the nomination and only reluctantly accepted it, but his sympathies were well-known. He had been among the Republican electors who voted Lincoln into the White House and then had been his last official appointment before the president’s assassination. That marked him as one of the early carpetbaggers. Conversely, no white Southerner questioned Virginia-born McEnery’s loyalty. As a member of the House, he had been a strong supporter of President Johnson, voting against the Fourteenth Amendment and for various laws legalizing forms of racial discrimination.
Traditionally, presidential candidates did not actively campaign on the theory that “the office picks the man.” Instead, they were represented by surrogates, well-known men who appeared at rallies to urge voters to support their candidate. Greeley, though, generally considered among the country’s most gifted public speakers, took to the stump. His friends and supporters worried about his habit of saying out loud sometimes controversial thoughts that seemingly just popped into his mind, while Republicans welcomed him, hopeful he would commit some irreparable indiscretion.
Gubernatorial candidates often campaigned personally, although they also used surrogates.
As the fall campaign season began, New Orleanians were focused on more immediate problems, including a serious shortage of ice. For reasons no one seemed to understand, an unusually large number of ice ships had been delayed. Smaller buyers had seen their monthly supplies cut in half. Saloons especially were suffering, and some desperate saloonkeepers were trying to bring ice supplies from Mobile.
Crime also remained a primary concern. “One murder a day and one conviction a year,” the Republican wrote, complaining about authorities being too soft on criminals. “The reason for this unhappy state of affairs is that our juries are, under the present laws and practice, organized to acquit, not convict. If we were to infuse into our criminal practice a slight dash of the principles that rule in ‘Judge Lynch’s’ court we should soon see a marked improvement... For efficiency lynch law is superior to statute law, but the latter can very easily be made more perfect.”
As far as amusements were concerned, both the Academy of Music and the Varieties offered a full slate of shows and concerts. It also was reported that P. T. Barnum’s show, with its “myriad wonders and curiosities” thus far had been unable to secure the four or five acres needed to “receive the canvas” anywhere in the city, but Barnum remained hopeful that he would find a suitable location to pitch his tents.
Politics had not yet taken hold of the public’s full attention. In New Orleans, a three-year-old child was run down and seriously injured by a wagon, and unfortunately “the driver succeeded in making his escape.” And Goodspeed’s Empire Book House was advertising for agents to sell Mark Twain’s new book, telling them, “Don’t work on books no one wants, but take one people will stop you in the streets to subscribe for...”
As usual, there was trouble on the Mexican border. In Brownsville, Texas, two prominent frontier merchants had been attacked by bandits. One of the Texans had been shot to death. In response, “A strong feeling was manifested to organize a force” and pursue the killers into Mexico.
It wasn’t until early October that the public began focusing on the campaigns. They were a big draw. Political rallies were major social events. Thousands of people would show up outdoors or crowd into theaters for the opportunity to see these celebrities in person. Bands played lively tunes, and everyone would join together loudly singing the popular songs, especially “Dixie.” There was some drinking, of course, and rallies often were punctuated with firecrackers and rockets. As the Picayune described a Greeley rally, “A large platform was erected in the center of Lafayette Square, which was profusely illuminated. Greeley’s name was conspicuous on a large transparency which arched the speaker’s rostrum. At each corner of the square large bonfires were lighted...
“At 8 o’clock the opening of the meeting was announced by the firing of two hundred guns by the artillery regiment.” About a dozen prominent local men were seated on the platform. “A fair computation of the people assembled...would place the number at about five thousand and hundreds more visited during the evening.”
At the conclusion of the rally, it was announced, the band would march to Liberal Republican headquarters to serenade Governor Warmoth. All were welcome to join the procession.
And so it went in towns and cities throughout Louisiana and the rest of America. Warmoth and his close friend George Sheridan, whom he had appointed brigadier general of the state militia, acted as surrogates for both Greeley and McEnery. In Minden, Louisiana, they were escorted into the town by six hundred men on horseback, the procession led by a band in “a chariot led by six horses.”
At some of these rallies women were welcome, even seated up front as candidates implored them to make sure their men voted!
As much as people turned out to see Warmoth, Sheridan was equally popular. He was considered to be among the country’s most gifted public speakers, known for his down-home common sense, his humor and his political rhetoric. At an outdoor rally in support of Colonel McEnery held in Lafayette Square, Sheridan pointed out how much had changed in the last two years. “When I started out on this campaign,” he said, as spectators crowded close to the platform to hear him, “I said to Governor Warmoth, ‘How do you feel about canvassing the State?’ Said he, ‘I think the people will be better pleased to see us than they were in seventy.’ And everything drifted along pleasantly until one night we got lost in the piney woods, near Natchitoches, and it became very dark.
“I said, ‘Governor Warmoth, have you reflected that we are off the great line of travel, that the people of Louisiana do not often get the newspapers and have probably not heard of your change of politics?’ Said he to our driver, ‘Drive a little faster, Randolph.’ After a little while we ran across two regular specimens of backwoodsmen with shotguns on their shoulders. I mildly suggested to Governor Warmoth, Ku-Klux come at last. Said he, ‘Sheridan, as you are the praying man of this concern, you had better begin to pray.’
“I suggested to him that as his legs were the longest, he had better do the praying and let me get a start!”
Throughout the fall the rival campaigns proceeded with the expected hoopla. The usual promises were made—the public’s money would not be wasted, taxes would not be raised, the working man would be represented—platforms were defended and lots of mud was slung. Grant accused Greeley of duplicity, trying to win favor with Southerners by telling an audience in Vicksburg, Mississippi, that one day Confederate soldiers who fought with General Robert E. Lee “would occupy as proud a position in the hearts of Americans as the soldiers who fought with Grant and Sherman.”
Greeley angrily denied that, responding that he actually had said he “trusted the day would come when the soldierly qualities and military genius of Lee and Jackson would be regarded as part of the heritage of the American people...”
Grant was regularly vilified: he was called just about every reprehensible name imaginable. Democratic newspapers wrote, “He has degraded that office in the estimation of the people and the eyes of the world...has used his influence to secure his own promotion, and reward his own relatives and friends...”
Greeley was attacked so intensely, he joked, that he was forced to wonder if he was running for the presidency or the penitentiary.
The state campaigns were equally nasty. Warmoth accused Republicans of illegally “bringing [people] from other States and registering them in New Orleans and the parishes by the river.”
Kellogg campaigned relentlessly, visiting more cities and towns than any candidate before him, speaking at a rally every day from late September through election day. He spoke for as long as three hours at each stop, his voice growing hoarse, telling tens of thousands of supporters that Democrats were fraudulently registering ineligible voters and had “declared publicly if he was beaten he would send all the leading Liberals in the State to the Penitentiary.”
Colonel McEnery knew that to win he had to reduce Kellogg’s support in the Black community, so he took every opportunity to remind Republicans that, among other transgressions, “when Mr. Kellogg was in the Senate of the United States he had not the moral courage to vote yea or nay upon the civil rights bill, which was defeated in consequences.” Rumors spread that Kellogg hated Louisiana and was a racist who always wore a glove when shaking hands with a Black man.
As the election approached, the candidates tried to scare their supporters to the polls by warning what would happen if the opposition was elected. Democrats emphasized the fact that Kellogg was a carpetbagger who had never really lived in the state and claimed that after being elected he would resign and return to the Senate, making Black Lieutenant Governor C. C. Antoine the governor.
Republicans countered by warning that McEnery secretly supported the white supremacist groups and if elected would allow organizations like the Ku Klux free rein to spread terror.
Away from the torchlights and the colorful rockets, though, a different, darker campaign was being waged. Guns came out. Newspapers played a key role, further inflaming an already-tense situation. Local papers ran sensational stories about towns being burned, newspaper offices being blown up and local law enforcement officers being shot. In an early local election in Macon, Georgia, Black men were driven away from the polls with “a shower of brickbats and bullets.” In Monroe, Louisiana, it was reported a State Senate candidate was surrounded “by a mob of ruffians” who threatened, “If the Republicans are defeated, not only carpetbaggers but every man who has affiliated with the Republican party will have to leave North Louisiana or die.”
The New York Herald summed up the entire campaign with disgust. “It has been a season of civil war among the politicians, and all the passions engendered by internal strife has been called into play to embitter and intensify the contest...
“The party organs have been reckless in their attacks and careless of the result, their apparent object being to fan the flame of discord and to increase violence and factional hate.”
But the election really came down to one person. A Congressional investigation convened in Louisiana after the events to try to understand how the disaster unfolded. The conclusion they reached was unambiguous: “The organization of the election throughout the whole State originated with and was controlled by Warmoth. It is not denied that Warmoth meant fraud, and that he had the power to affect it.”

“TO ABSENTEES,” the Times-Picayune pleaded as the election approached, “Return to your homes promptly and prepare to vote. The most important duty before you is that of voting and inducing your fellow-citizens to vote. Business can be sacrificed to this great purpose, and the man who would weigh pleasure in the same scale with voting is guilty... Voters, come back!”
Once again, ordinary Americans were going to the polls to freely choose their representatives. Creating a government of the people, by the people and for the people, just as the Founding Fathers had envisioned. Free elections were the hallmark of democracy, the reason subjugated people around the world looked to America for hope.
It was a noble endeavor.
Except, in Louisiana in 1872, it was a myth. The entire system—from registration through counting the votes—had been corrupted. At every step in the process there existed some type of intimidation, cheating or fraud intended to change the outcome.
There had always been a modicum of dishonesty in the electoral process. It was as persistent and bothersome as mosquitoes, and it had proved equally impossible to get rid of. And like a mosquito bite, in most cases it was little more than an irritant, an itch that needed to be scratched. Except in places like Louisiana, where mosquitoes had unleashed a yellow fever epidemic that had led to widespread and controversial quarantines—although at the time the disease was believed to be transmitted by immigrants.
The New York Times railed that “the violation of the integrity of the ballot-box constitute offenses against the public welfare more criminal than Congressmen...who accepted bribes.” But most instances of cheating in elections were overlooked, and as long as they didn’t dramatically impact the outcome it was accepted as an unresolved evil.
Politicians long ago had become skilled at legally rigging state elections by creating voting districts favorable to their party. The goal of drawing election districts was to stuff as many of the opposition’s supporters into as few districts as possible. The practice was as old as the Republic; when the first Congressional maps were drawn in 1788, Anti-Federalists in Virginia put Federalist James Madison in the same Anti-Federalist area as their candidate, James Monroe.
The original district boundary lines were reasonably straight, but the practice was taken to a new level in 1812 when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry drew a district that bent and curved like a salamander to include as many of his Democratic-Republican voters as possible. Gerrymandering, as the process became called, was a legal method of stuffing ballot boxes. The majority party in every state created its own maps; as a result, by 1872 in New York it took 90,000 Republican votes to elect a representative while Democrats required 160,
