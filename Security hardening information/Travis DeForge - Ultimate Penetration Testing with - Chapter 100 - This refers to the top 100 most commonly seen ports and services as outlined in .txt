# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Travis DeForge - Ultimate Penetration Testing with Nmap_ Master Cybersecurity Assessments for Network Security, Monitoring, and Scanning Using N (2024, Orange Education Pvt Ltd, AVA™) - libgen.li
Chapter: 100 - This refers to the top 100 most commonly seen ports and services as outlined in the Nmap Well-Known Ports List (https://nmap.org/book/nmap-services.html). While this flag does substantially increase the speed compared to a base scan, it is important to note that very commonly there will be key ports missed. The best way to utilize this scan is as a way to determine which subnets or endpoints of the greater scope should be marked for additional analysis. This is also a technique we will explore further in Chapter 5: Mapping a Large Environment.
--top-ports #: We have established that the default of Nmap is to scan the top 1000 ports, and you can use the -F flag to reduce that to the top 100. But what if you want to scan the top 25? Or 50? Or 1000? That is where the --top-ports flag comes in; this allows you to specify the exact number to scan, which can help provide a good balance between speed and depth. From numerous interviews with accomplished network penetration testers, the most common specification for this flag seems to be --top-ports 2500. This ensures that the vast majority of regularly seen ports are covered while also substantially reducing the time it would take to scan every port.
--version-intensity #: The previous chapter established that the service version could be abled via the -sV command, but additional nuance can be added by specifying the intensity of that versioning effort between 0 and 9. This is done by sending a series of probes with assigned values to all identified open ports in an attempt to determine the service running on them. The default value of -sV is “7”. So, if your objective is to return results quicker, select a lower number, and if you are trying to get a more accurate fingerprint, select the higher value:
