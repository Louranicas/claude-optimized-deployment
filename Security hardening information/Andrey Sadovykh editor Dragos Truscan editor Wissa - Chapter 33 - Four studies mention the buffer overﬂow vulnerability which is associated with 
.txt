Chapter: 33 - Four studies mention the buffer overﬂow vulnerability, which is associated with 
memory 
corruption. When this vulnerability is exploited, the attacker can modify 
program execution [ 17]. Additionally, this vulnerability is closely connected to 
another 
vulnerability discussed in three studies, namely, the lack of input validation. 
By validating input, the program will only accept values within an acceptable range, such as input character length, and prevent buffer overﬂow [ 17, 18]. 
The three studies that discuss the lack of information about hardware and 
ﬁrmw
are present a conﬂicting situation. On the one hand, PLC vendors require 
security research and measures to be taken against possible attacks. However, since the hardware and ﬁrmware they use are proprietary and not publicly available, 
conducting research to obtain reliable results on how to mitigate the possibility of 
attacks is nearly impossible [ 17, 19]. Therefore, this vulnerability is primarily due 
to 
the vendors’ choices rather than the system itself. 
Human issues are mentioned as a vulnerability in three studies (S34-S36). This 
cate
gory encompasses inexperienced developers, naive users who might uninten-
tionally make the system vulnerable to attacks, or personnel who may intentionally 
try to attack the system. Access control, on the other hand, is the least frequently 
mentioned vulnerability category, with only two papers discussing it. S1 and S43 focus on the importance of providing users with information based on their needs 
and granting privileged access only to authorized users. Refer to Table 1.4 for the 
papers 
in each category.
