11.1 Introduction
Cybersecurity (CS) comprises practices, technologies, and processes. These entities protect and defend networks, devices, software (SW), and data from CA, damage, or illicit access. The exponential augmentation of interconnected gadgets, systems, and networks urges complex CS. Digital economy and infrastructure advances worsen this by causing a significant CA increase, which has serious repercussions. Nation‐state‐affiliated and criminal antagonists and the mounting CAs’ intricacy prompt new and intrusive ways to target menaces, thus requiring constant updating via “artificial intelligence” (AI). This CAs’ snowballing happens in number, scale, impact, and calls or AI‐driven CS (AICS) for dynamic defenses against CAs. AICS can also tackle “big data” (BD). Advisory organizations, viz. the “National Institute of Standards and Technologies” (NIST) [1], have and encourage proactive and adaptive strategies by shifting towards real‐time (RT) appraisals, continuous scrutiny, and data‐driven analysis to pick up, protect against, and respond to. Catalog CAs prevent future “cyber threat” (CT) incidents (CTinc) [1]. AI affords intelligent analytics to shield against ever‐evolving CAs by swiftly scrutinizing many events and tracking various CTs to anticipate and act before the problem. Therefore, AI increasingly integrates into the CS fabric in multiple “use cases” (UCs) that automate safekeeping tasks or sustain human security teams. Before returning to (AI) in CS, alias AICS, cloud computing (CC) models must be defined (Figure 11.1):


Figure 11.1 Multi‐layer cloud computing framework.



Software‐as‐a‐Service (SaaS): It lets clients connect to and run cloud apps throughout the Internet, where email, electronic agendas, spreadsheets, and desktop tools (like Microsoft Office software (SW)) are some instances. SaaS delivers a complete SW‐purchased solution from a cloud service supplier through buying licenses (aka subscriptions), which allow SW access employing external servers, enabling each user to reach and execute programs via the Internet rather than installing the SW on the user’s machine. SaaS services offer small businesses an opportunity to better handle existing markets with fair pricing and accessibility via an Internet browser from any device uninterruptedly.
Platform‐as‐a‐Service (PaaS): PaaS or “platform‐based service” is a CC service type that permits clients to generate, instantiate, execute, and manage modules encompassing a computing platform with at least an application without the infrastructural complexity necessary to build and maintain assets typically associated with applications’ development, launching and patching, while permitting developers to plan, develop, and release SW bundles.
Infrastructure‐as‐a‐Service (IaaS): This CC service model supplies computing resources from a cloud vendor, e.g., servers, storage space, network, and virtualization to emulate hardware. IaaS frees users from maintaining data centers (DCs) and affords them to host these assets in the public cloud (by sharing the same hardware, memory, and network structure with other users), private cloud (resources are not shared), or hybrid cloud (a public/private combination). It offers high‐level APIs for customers to dereference several low‐level particulars of network arrangements like data partitioning, backup, scaling, physical computing resources, security, etc. A hypervisor organizes the virtual machines like guests. The cloud operational system contains hypervisors’ pools that sustain many virtual machines and can upscale and downscale services consistently with customers’ fluctuating necessities.

In CC use cases, BD can be organized in clouds whose nature can be threefold: private, public, or hybrid. Backup‐as‐a‐service (Baas). IaaS revolves around DCs, all their usages, and data handling. DCs have specific consulting services. When redesigning DCs for CC, one must implement services like storage arrays or incorporate offsite storage into a current network.
AI’s and CS’s growing research enthusiasm fostered numerous studies to solve CAs’ identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery caveats. This chapter mentions how AICS or CS intelligence (CTI) assists UCs, discussing ways to foster future developments. Looking at the above picture, one can conclude that CC can apply AI to any of its layers. AICS focuses on practical applications, as per NIST [1, 2]. Key issues are (i) adequate taxonomical AICS representations, (ii) some specific AICS UCs, (iii) current AICS, and (iv) AICS trending themes and future directions. These points led to the following:

An AICS taxonomy with CS functions, solution categories, and specific UCs.
Specific AICS UCs can reveal potential areas to harness AI capabilities.
An acute analysis to identify CS gaps.
