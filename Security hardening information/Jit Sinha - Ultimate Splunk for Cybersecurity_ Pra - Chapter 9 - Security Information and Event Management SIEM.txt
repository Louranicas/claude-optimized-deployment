Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. The effectiveness of a SIEM solution is significantly dependent on the quality and organization of the ingested data. Using the knowledge acquired in this chapter, you will be able to optimize your SIEM system, ensuring accurate detection, analysis, and response to security incidents and events.
In the upcoming chapter, we will delve deeper into the realm of SIEM by examining its fundamental components, functionalities, and advantages. We will discuss the integration of SIEM systems with various data sources, including ingested and normalized Splunk data. In addition, we will discuss real-world use cases, deployment considerations, and implementation and management best practices for an SIEM solution. The combination of a solid foundation in data ingestion and normalization with an in-depth understanding of SIEM systems will enable you to better safeguard the digital assets of your organization and strengthen its cybersecurity posture.
Points to Remember

Data ingestion is the process of accumulating and indexing data into Splunk, whereas data normalization is the process of standardizing and structuring the data in preparation for analysis.
Identifying the sources of data and determining the optimal method for ingesting the data into Splunk is the first stage in data ingestion.
In addition to guaranteeing data compatibility and fixing any interoperability issues, one should always take into account and evaluate potential security and privacy concerns.
Multiple data sources, including files, network ports, APIs, and message queues, are supported by Splunk.
For consistent analysis, it is essential to standardize the data formats across all sources. CIM can be employed to standardize data pertaining to security.
Field extractions can be used to identify and extract particular data fields, whereas lookups and mapping tables can be used to enrich the data with additional context or information.
Regular expressions (Regex) are capable of matching and extracting data patterns from unstructured data.
Event type categorization can be used to categorize events based on specific attributes or characteristics, facilitating the identification of patterns or anomalies in the data.
Since Splunk is optimized for time-based processing, timestamp-based processing is essential for accurate indexing and analysis.
Data previewing can help identify any problems with the data before they are ingested, and monitoring data quality over time is essential for ensuring accurate and consistent analysis.
Planning your data strategy, using standardized data formats, CIM, field extractions, lookups and mapping tables, Regex, event type categorization, time-based processing, previewing data, and monitoring data quality are best practices for data ingestion and normalization.
