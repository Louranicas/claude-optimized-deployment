Chapter: 9 - But without official returns there was no way of determining who had been elected. As in other areas of government and the judiciary, often two men claimed the same seat.
While the election was being fought in courtrooms, the competing Returning Boards began counting votes. Or at least presenting tallies to justify their preferred results. Those numbers were bogus, that was well-known. That didn’t seem to make any difference. Warmoth’s Board appointed secretaries and clerks and “proceeded to tabulate the returns honestly.” The Lynch Board created its tally from numerous sources, which allowed them to add thousands to the total that might have been cast for Kellogg if his supporters had been allowed to vote.
Warmoth’s Board announced that McEnery had been elected by 10,000 votes—65,579 to Kellogg’s 55,973. The Lynch Board countered by reporting that if registered voters had been permitted to vote, Kellogg would have won by 18,861 votes.
Those vote totals had no real meaning. It had become obvious the election was going to be decided in Judge Durell’s federal courtroom. In anticipation of Durell’s decision, the attorney general had put on alert “four thousand troops comprising artillery, cavalry and the good old reliable infantry, all dressed in blue...so that law-abiding people may calm all fears that blood will be spilled... The government does not intend...any faction shall murder American citizens...”
A worried officer told a reporter, “If we are ordered to fire upon a crowd, and that order should be illegal at law, we are liable to be tried for murder, and if we do not fire we may be court martialed for disobedience for disobeying orders.”
People began lining up outside Judge Durell’s courtroom the day before the trial. To prove that Black citizens had been denied the right to vote, Kellogg had collected five thousand affidavits and was prepared to present witnesses to tell their stories. These men “roosted on window ledges, lay about the floors, stow themselves away in the embrasures and let their heads fall negligently on their knees and squat in the niches of the edifice, all of them satisfied that if allowed to testify they can show such a state of affairs...which would lead whole communities to sympathize with them.”
Perhaps even more important, this was no longer a local matter. It had become a huge national story. Did the federal government have jurisdiction? The decision would help define the reach of the new Amendments and the balance between states’ rights and the federal government. “The Threatened Conflict Between State and Federal Power,” warned a New York Herald headline. Numerous subheads outlined the stakes: “The Issue of Reconstruction,” “Warmoth the Prince of Carpetbaggers,” “No Public Spirit or Honesty Anywhere,” “A Terrible Story of Robbery, Outrage and Wrong” and, finally, “Fears of Riot and Bloodshed in New Orleans and a Coup d’Etat.”
Warmoth relentlessly attacked Judge Durell’s character, telling people the judge was too old, kept his “closet stocked with choice wines and liquors” and claimed a close male friend was his “nightly companion; they were inseparable and were often together until late hours of the night.”
His supporters were provoked, just as he intended. The New York Times reported the judge “has received several letters threatening his life, that he will be assassinated if he decides in favor [of Kellogg].” Kellogg and several other government officials connected to the case also were warned about ruling against Warmoth.
Judge Durell was not deterred.

An estimated three thousand people gathered outside the heavily guarded Mechanics Institute on Monday morning as the state legislature convened for the special session. It was a raucous crowd, and many were there more out of curiosity than to support either faction. No one had the slightest idea what was going to take place inside—all kinds of rumors had been spreading throughout the weekend—but even their wildest guesses could not possibly have anticipated what was about to unfold.
Governor Warmoth had a plan he was ready to spring. There was a reason he had called this special session. He knew that the first few seconds would make all the difference. In his plan, the senators who held office in the previous session would use their legislative experience to seize control of the chamber before their newly elected replacements could be sworn in. With his senate in place, Warmoth could make a fight for McEnery.
Lieutenant Governor Pinchback, presiding over the Senate, also was ready. He certainly had not forgotten the embarrassment of the great train race back from New York. This was his opportunity to get even—and if things fell into place, it could lead to an even greater victory. He had taken his seat at the front of the room long before noon, perhaps because, as the Times-Picayune speculated, “he feared if he waited it might become occupied by someone else.”
At noon, he called the Senate to order. He asked the secretary of the Senate to call the roll. Instantly, Senator William McMillen stood and proposed a motion. Warmoth’s strategy had begun.
The foundations of parliamentary procedure, the rules of order by which a legislative body conducts its business, were first written down by the clerk of England’s House of Commons in
