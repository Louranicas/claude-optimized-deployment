# Security Chapter Extract

Chapter: 2017 - It brought a revolutionary transformation in China’s digital space by formulating regulations with the interest of safeguarding data, data localization, and streamlining cybersecurity measures.
This law is applicable to all digital citizens of the People’s Republic of China including business owners and network operators. Failing to abide by the law, there are penalties and punishments that help keep the national security tamed.
AI has emerged powerful as a double-edged sword that acts on both offensive and defensive fronts in the cyber realm. Further, employing state-of-the-art approaches make AI a formidable asset that continues to take the digital landscape by a storm, making it more tedious to tame any cyberattacks and take actions against them following the lack of befitting cyber laws. The case study mentioned in the literature survey above highlights the use of AI to scam netizens by deepfaking audios, videos, images, or text. This involves cloning a certain individuals’ voice while also replicating its mannerisms and emotional nuances to make it seem real. AI also uses strong evasion mechanisms to mislead security systems.
On the other side of the coin, AI helps with threat detection by predicting patterns that help in understanding the modus operandi and get to the root of cyberattacks. For example, file carving can be done easily by AI to recover deleted files or fragmented files from memory dumps to process evidence accurately. In digital forensics, evidence may get tampered with if not handled with precautions and analyzed securely. Such evidence gets rejected by the law and may lead to obstacles in discovering who is accountable for the said crime.
If used judiciously, AI can aid in protecting digital assets by also providing evidence of potential cyberattacks, which could be admissible in law enforcement organizations. This is possible if the pre-existing laws are reviewed to incorporate the prospect of AI being used to infiltrate cyberspace. Table 6.2 explains about various pre-existing cyberlaws, frameworks, and their distinction.

6.7 Awareness and Advancements
The spreading of awareness about the limitless advantages and significance of AI to punch through these legal and ethical crossroads has to be stepped up. This balance can only be achieved if there is collaboration among the actors who have relevance to the general public, the making of the policy, legal experts, technologists as well as the policymakers. For this balance to be struck in an effective manner, it is necessary that ethical guidelines and the regulatory framework provide a way of conclusions, and they are not prescriptive since AI technologies change with time.


6.8 Conclusion
This chapter discusses the legal, ethical, technical, and technical considerations necessary for responsible AI development in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and society. Our research enhances existing knowledge through complex balancing needed between innovation promotion and social security on opportunities. By examining the complex interactions of these factors, we highlighted the need for coherent dialogue, international cooperation, and the evolution of the legal system. These systems must not only meet current challenges but also anticipate future issues brought about by the rapidly advancing AI of our digital age. This work contributes to an ongoing discourse by providing comprehensive research that informs policymakers, technologists, and ethicists, thus guiding AI development through ethical standards and social norms.


Acknowledgment
We would like to express our sincere gratitude and heartfelt thanks to the management of Dr. Vishwanath Karad, MIT World Peace University, Pune for their encouragement, support, and making resources available throughout the research work. We hope that our findings will make a meaningful contribution to the field of Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.
