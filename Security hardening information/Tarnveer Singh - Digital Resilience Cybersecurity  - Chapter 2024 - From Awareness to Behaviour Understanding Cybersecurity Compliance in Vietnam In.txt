DOI: 10.4324/9781003604969-11


Asset Inventory Management
Oyedokun and Campbell (2023) contend that in today’s digital landscape, where businesses heavily rely on technology and data, effective asset inventory management has become a critical component for ensuring operational efficiency, cybersecurity, and successful supplier relationships.1
Faulk Jr (2024) argues executive leaders often complain they don’t receive reliable or consistent information over IT asset management yet there is significance in maintaining an accurate and up-to-date inventory of an organisation’s assets, including hardware, software, and digital resources.2
Asset inventory management is the process of identifying, tracking, and managing an organisation’s assets throughout their lifecycle. It involves cataloguing all assets, monitoring their usage, and ensuring their proper maintenance and disposal. Olivero (2022) argues automating identification using asset discovering tools is a good way to support cybersecurity.3
Kotenko et al. (2022) argue the case for automation in asset inventory management. By implementing a robust asset inventory management strategy, organisations can gain better control over their assets, mitigate risks, and optimise resource allocation.4
We must delve into the importance of effective asset inventory management, and its role in cybersecurity and supplier relationships, and explore best practices and tools for successful implementation.
The role of asset inventory management in cybersecurity should not be underestimated. Cybersecurity is a paramount concern for organisations of all sizes and across all industries. Effective asset inventory management plays a crucial role in maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture by providing visibility into an organisation’s digital assets and their potential vulnerabilities.
Yaseen (2024) puts forward the case for greater automation as without a comprehensive asset inventory, organisations may overlook critical software updates or patch management, or fail to identify and address potential entry points for cyber threats. An accurate inventory enables organisations to identify and prioritise assets based on their criticality, ensuring that the most sensitive and valuable assets receive the necessary security measures and resources.5
Furthermore, asset inventory management facilitates the implementation of access controls and data protection measures. By maintaining a detailed inventory of authorised users and their respective access levels, organisations can prevent unauthorised access to sensitive data and systems, reducing the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.
In today’s interconnected business environment, organisations often rely on third-party suppliers and vendors to provide various products and services. Effective asset inventory management is crucial for maintaining strong supplier relationships and ensuring compliance with contractual obligations.
By having a comprehensive inventory of assets, organisations can accurately track and manage licences, subscriptions, and maintenance agreements with suppliers. This transparency not only ensures compliance with licensing terms but also facilitates better budgeting and resource allocation for software and hardware renewals or upgrades.
Moreover, asset inventory management enables organisations to monitor and validate the performance of supplier-provided assets, ensuring that they meet the agreed-upon service levels and specifications. This accountability fosters trust and strengthens the relationship between organisations and their suppliers, leading to more productive and mutually beneficial collaborations.
Common challenges in asset inventory management make achieving this tricky. While the benefits of effective asset inventory management are undeniable, organisations often face several challenges in implementing and maintaining a robust inventory management system.
Ensuring that asset inventory data is accurate, up to date, and complete can be a daunting task, especially in large and complex organisations with numerous assets distributed across multiple locations. Tracking assets throughout their entire lifecycle, from procurement to disposal, can be challenging, particularly when assets are frequently moved, upgraded, or decommissioned.
In organisations with decentralised operations or multiple departments, maintaining a centralised and consistent asset inventory can be difficult due to siloed data and lack of coordination. Implementing and maintaining an effective asset inventory management system often requires dedicated resources, including personnel, software tools, and infrastructure, which can be a challenge for organisations with limited budgets or staffing constraints. Integrating asset inventory management systems with existing IT infrastructure, databases, and other systems can be complex, requiring significant effort and expertise.
Develop and implement well-defined policies and procedures for asset inventory management, including guidelines for asset acquisition, tracking, maintenance, and disposal. These policies should be communicated and enforced across the organisation. Maintain a centralised and consolidated asset inventory database to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and accessibility. This centralised repository should serve as a single source of truth for all asset-related information.
Leverage automated asset discovery and tracking tools to streamline the process of identifying and cataloguing assets across the organisation. These tools can help reduce manual effort and improve data accuracy. Integrate the asset inventory management system with other relevant systems, such as IT service management (ITSM), configuration management databases (CMDBs), and financial systems, to ensure data consistency and enable seamless information exchange.
Define clear roles and responsibilities for asset inventory management within the organisation. Designate asset owners, custodians, and stakeholders responsible for maintaining and updating asset information. Perform regular audits and reconciliations to verify the accuracy and completeness of asset inventory data. This process should involve physical inspections, software licence audits, and data validation against other systems.
Implement training programmes and awareness campaigns to educate employees on the importance of asset inventory management and their roles and responsibilities in maintaining accurate asset data.
Tools and technologies are available for asset inventory management. Asset inventory management software solutions designed to manage and track assets throughout their life cycle. These tools typically offer features such as asset discovery, cataloguing, reporting, and integration with other systems.
Asset tracking and barcoding systems are crucial. Physical asset tracking systems use barcodes, RFID tags, or other identification methods to track the location and movement of assets within an organisation.
Centralised repositories that store and manage information about IT assets, configurations, and their relationships, CMDBs can be integrated with asset inventory management systems to provide a comprehensive view of an organisation’s IT infrastructure.
Cloud-based platforms offer asset inventory management capabilities, often with scalable and flexible deployment options, and the ability to access asset data from anywhere. Mobile applications enable field technicians or remote employees to scan and update asset information on the go, improving data accuracy and real-time visibility.
Automated asset discovery tools can automatically discover and catalogue IT assets across an organisation’s network, reducing manual effort and improving data completeness.
Developing an effective asset inventory management strategy requires a structured approach and careful planning. Clearly define the objectives and scope of the asset inventory management initiative. Determine which asset types (hardware, software, digital resources) and organisational units or locations will be included in the inventory. Perform a baseline assessment to understand the current state of asset inventory management within the organisation. Identify existing processes, tools, and data sources, as well as gaps and areas for improvement.
Establish comprehensive policies and procedures for asset inventory management, covering areas such as asset acquisition, tracking, maintenance, disposal, and data governance. Evaluate and select the appropriate tools and technologies to support asset inventory management based on the organisation’s requirements, budget, and existing infrastructure.
Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in asset inventory management, including asset owners, custodians, IT staff, and management. Ensure that the asset inventory management system integrates seamlessly with other relevant systems, such as ITSM, CMDBs, and financial systems, to facilitate data exchange and consistency.
Create training programmes and communication plans to educate employees on the importance of asset inventory management and their roles and responsibilities in maintaining accurate asset data. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and establish regular reporting mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of asset inventory management and identify areas for improvement. Establish processes for continuous improvement, including regular audits, data validation, and process optimisation, to ensure the asset inventory management strategy remains effective and aligned with organisational objectives.

Additionally, the rise of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) will necessitate the development of specialised threat intelligence solutions tailored to these environments. As businesses increasingly adopt cloud services and interconnected devices, ensuring the security of these platforms and safeguarding against potential threats will become paramount.
Furthermore, the future of threat intelligence will likely involve increased collaboration and information sharing among organisations, industries, and even nations. By fostering a culture of collective intelligence and leveraging shared resources, businesses can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the global threat landscape and develop more effective countermeasures.
Moreover, the integration of threat intelligence with other cybersecurity disciplines, such as incident response, vulnerability management, and risk assessment, will become increasingly seamless. This holistic approach will enable organisations to proactively identify and mitigate threats while also enhancing their overall cybersecurity posture.
Supply chains have become increasingly complex, spanning multiple organisations and geographical boundaries. As a result, the attack surface – the sum of all potential entry points for cyber threats – has expanded significantly.
Amoo et al. (2024) argue the rise of IoT and higher levels of working from home since the pandemic have contributed to the attack surface, as have emerging threats. Cybersecurity in the supply chain is a critical concern, as a breach at any point can have far-reaching consequences, compromising sensitive data, disrupting operations, and eroding customer trust.16
We live in an era where cyber threats are constantly evolving, and attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their methods. Supply chains, with their intricate web of interconnected systems and third-party dependencies, are particularly vulnerable to these threats.

Continuous Monitoring
Attack surface monitoring is the process of continuously identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities and exposures that could be exploited by cyber adversaries. It involves mapping and analysing the entire attack surface, including hardware, software, networks, data, and human elements, to detect and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.
Osazuwa and Musa (2024) contend that we have an ever-expanding attack surface and security operations need to use emerging technologies as part of their attack surface monitoring if they are to maintain adequate control. A single weak link in the chain can expose the entire ecosystem to cyber risks, making it imperative for organisations to adopt a proactive and continuous approach to monitoring their attack surface.17
In the context of supply chains, attack surface monitoring is particularly crucial due to the numerous interconnections and dependencies involved. It enables organisations to gain visibility into the cyber risks posed by their suppliers, partners, and third-party vendors, as well as their own internal systems and processes.
The importance of continuous attack surface monitoring cannot be overstated. Continuous attack surface monitoring is essential. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. Continuous monitoring ensures that organisations can quickly identify and respond to emerging threats, minimising the risk of successful attacks.
Supply chains are not static entities; they are dynamic, with new partners, technologies, and processes being introduced regularly. Continuous monitoring allows organisations to adapt to these changes and maintain an up-to-date understanding of their attack surface. Many industries have stringent cybersecurity regulations and compliance requirements. Continuous attack surface monitoring helps organisations demonstrate their commitment to cybersecurity and meet these regulatory obligations.

Continuous monitoring allows organisations to assess and manage the cyber risks posed by their suppliers and third-party vendors, enabling them to take appropriate measures to mitigate potential threats.
In the event of a cyber attack, continuous monitoring can aid in rapid incident response and recovery efforts by providing valuable insights into the nature and scope of the attack, as well as potential entry points and affected systems.
Many industries have strict cybersecurity regulations and compliance requirements. Continuous attack surface monitoring can help organisations demonstrate their commitment to cybersecurity and meet these regulatory obligations.
By proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, organisations can potentially avoid the significant financial and reputational costs associated with successful cyber attacks and data breaches.
While continuous attack surface monitoring offers numerous benefits, it also presents several challenges and limitations. Supply chains can be highly complex, involving numerous interconnected systems, technologies, and third-party dependencies. Monitoring the entire attack surface in such an environment can be a daunting task, requiring significant resources and expertise.
Continuous monitoring generates a vast amount of data, which needs to be effectively managed, analysed, and acted upon. Organisations may struggle with data overload, making it difficult to identify and prioritise critical vulnerabilities.
Automated monitoring tools can sometimes generate false positives, leading to unnecessary investigations and wasted resources. Finding the right balance between sensitivity and specificity is crucial.
Implementing and maintaining an effective continuous attack surface monitoring programme requires skilled cybersecurity professionals with specialised knowledge and expertise. Attracting and retaining such talent can be a challenge for many organisations.
Integrating monitoring tools and processes with existing systems and workflows can be complex, particularly in heterogeneous environments with legacy systems and multiple vendors.
Effective attack surface monitoring in the supply chain requires cooperation and information sharing among all parties involved, including suppliers and third-party vendors. Ensuring this level of collaboration can be challenging, particularly when dealing with smaller or less mature organisations.
Develop a well-defined strategy that outlines the scope, objectives, and processes for continuous attack surface monitoring, ensuring alignment with the organisation’s overall cybersecurity and risk management goals.
Implement automated tools and solutions to streamline the monitoring process, reduce manual efforts, and improve efficiency. Automation can help organisations keep pace with the ever-changing threat landscape and the dynamic nature of supply chains.
Establish a risk-based approach to prioritising vulnerabilities based on factors such as criticality, likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact. This will help organisations allocate resources effectively and address the most pressing threats first.
Encourage collaboration and information sharing among all stakeholders in the supply chain, including suppliers, partners, and third-party vendors. This can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities more effectively.
Regularly review and update the attack surface monitoring programme to ensure it remains effective and aligned with evolving threats, technologies, and business requirements. Continuously seek opportunities for improvement and incorporate lessons learned from past incidents or exercises.
Ensure that the continuous attack surface monitoring programme is tightly integrated with the organisation’s incident response and recovery plans. This will enable a more coordinated and effective response in the event of a cyber attack or data breach.
Invest in ongoing training and awareness programmes for employees, suppliers, and partners to promote a strong cybersecurity culture and ensure that everyone understands their role in maintaining a secure attack surface.
Continuous attack surface monitoring relies on a range of tools and technologies to identify, assess, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Some of the commonly used tools and technologies include:
Vulnerability scanners scan systems, networks, and applications for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, providing insights into potential entry points for cyber attacks. Penetration testing tools simulate real-world cyber attacks to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organisation’s defences. These tools can be used to assess the effectiveness of existing security controls and identify areas for improvement.
SIEM solutions collect and analyse security-related data from various sources, including network devices, servers, and applications. This data can be used to detect potential threats, identify vulnerabilities, and support incident response efforts. Threat intelligence platforms provide up-to-date information on emerging cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors. This information can be used to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks.
As more organisations adopt cloud services, cloud security monitoring tools have become essential for monitoring the attack surface in cloud environments. These tools provide visibility into cloud infrastructure, applications, and data, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
With the proliferation of IoT devices in supply chains, IoT security solutions are necessary to monitor and secure these devices, which can often be overlooked and represent potential entry points for cyber attacks.
Third-party risk management platforms help organisations assess and manage the cyber risks posed by their suppliers, partners, and other third-party vendors. They provide visibility into the security posture of these third parties and enable continuous monitoring of their attack surface.
It’s important to note that no single tool or technology can provide complete protection against cyber threats. A comprehensive approach that combines multiple tools and technologies, along with robust processes and skilled personnel, is essential for effective continuous attack surface monitoring.
