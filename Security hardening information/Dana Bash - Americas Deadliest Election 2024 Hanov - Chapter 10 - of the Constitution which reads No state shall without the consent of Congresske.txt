Chapter: 10 - of the Constitution, which reads, “No state shall, without the consent of Congress...keep troops or ships of war in time of peace.”
The paper speculated this army had been formed in response to the threatened tax strike. “This is the first instance in the history of the country that a standing military force has been authorized by law to support any State government,” it continued, explaining, “It is designed...to enforce the collection of money out of the people.” The message was blunt. Should anyone dare resist Kellogg’s tax collectors, the governor could call on this “standing army of three thousand soldiers to assist in overawing—to shoot, slay and murder the People of Louisiana, who shall dare to resist his despotism.”
Tax revenue is the blood of politics. Government on every level depends on it. By depriving an administration of the funds needed to operate, a party out of power can influence and control policy.
The concept of starving Kellogg’s administration for money had come from Henry Warmoth, who admitted it would be much less effective in the cities than in rural areas, where tax collectors were more isolated and therefore vulnerable. It had been embraced by McEnery, who began organizing the strike in late March. In a letter he circulated throughout the state, “Governor” McEnery wrote that he “respectfully suggests that, with as little delay as possible, there be called in your parish a mass meeting of citizens to perfect a complete and thorough organization, with a view to the resistance of collection of taxes by the Kellogg government.”
The justification for refusing to pay taxes supposed that the Kellogg government was illegal, put in power by the federal government, which had no right to do so, and therefore Kellogg had no legal right to appoint tax collectors, and since the tax collectors had not been legally appointed, people did not have to pay them. It was a flimsy argument with little legal basis, but the idea of protesting by holding on to your money was, not surprisingly, very popular.
“Withholding money supplies is not a new method of confronting tyranny,” the Picayune told its readers. It went further, though, claiming the action was legal, the federal government could do nothing to stop it and “it may in a few months starve out the Kellogg government. And force it to surrender.”
It was an ancient tactic. Almost two thousand years earlier Judaeans refused to pay a Roman poll tax, and the Gospel of Luke suggests that Jesus was accused of promoting tax resistance by refusing to pay tribute to Caesar. When Florentines refused to pay a war tax in 1289, the government canceled it. Normans rioted against taxes in the mid-fourteenth century, burning the houses of tax collectors and destroying their equipment. In 1525, England’s Henry VIII was forced to abandon his dream of invading France when the nation’s wealthiest men resisted the collectors. And only twenty-five years earlier, when German aristocrats refused to allow the first popularly elected parliament to meet, Karl Marx wrote, “It is high treason to pay taxes. Refusal to pay taxes is the primary duty of the citizen.”
America had a long history of refusing to pay taxes as a means of political protest. In 1637 the indigenous Algonquins had refused a demand from Dutch settlers to pay for improved security. New Englanders declared fifty years later “it was not the town’s duty” to assist the British in collecting a new tax. Several other colonies, among them New Jersey, Connecticut and North Carolina, used the nonpayment of taxes to protest political decisions. In 1794, when farmers and distillers refused to pay a new federal tax on all distilled spirits, President George Washington had led an army of thirteen thousand militiamen into western Pennsylvania to put down the Whiskey Rebellion (or Whiskey Insurrection). Most recently, the author of Civil Disobedience, Henry David Thoreau, had gone to prison for failing to pay taxes to protest the Fugitive Slave Act and the Mexican–American War.
The Picayune wrote that not paying taxes was literally the foundation of democracy, writing, “The preservation of English liberty for so long a time has been due to the same resistance to the payment of taxes illegally imposed.” It was the duty of citizens not to pay taxes to Kellogg, adding, “The English people knew that as long as they held the purse they could hold the King...the enemies to their State cannot live without the money of the people; but with the money of the people, their oppression can and will be perpetuated.”
Ironically, this tactic had been introduced to Louisiana politics a year earlier—in opposition to Governor Warmoth. The Tax Resisting Association had been formed by “the most intelligent and wealthiest citizens of New Orleans” to resist high assessments. If a man could be found who enjoyed paying his taxes, said an association spokesman, “Barnum ought to get him or any other cheerful taxpayer.” The association had been formed, it announced, “to resist, by legal means, the present exorbitant, illegal and unconstitutional taxes now attempted to be extorted from us...”
By the time this group was formed, most people had already paid their taxes, so it had little effect, and the Warmoth legislature was done by the time taxes again became due. So the strategy remained the same, but in those few months it had been embraced by an entirely different body of people.
While the goal of Democrats was to financially starve the Kellogg administration into oblivion, the argument it made was that the tax rate was unfair, benefiting the rich carpetbaggers. Democrats asserted, “Those whom they [Republicans] represent do not pay them... They look upon them only as spoils to be appropriated.”
Republicans used the same argument, but from a different perspective. Kellogg issued a statement pointing out that “Experience shows that tax resisting associations result in the wealthier classes escaping payment of their taxes while the poorer men are not only compelled to pay their taxes, but additional penalties and costs...”
Breaking a tax strike is difficult. Washington had needed an army to do so. Reasoning with the protestors had rarely worked. The Republican media reminded readers that the people hurt most by the loss of tax revenue would be the people who needed it most. In an effort to evoke sympathy, they grouped these people as “widows and children.” The city would be left in the dark, uncollected garbage would spill onto the streets and crime would soar because the courts would remain closed. Travelers would avoid the city, hurting business. Ordinary upkeep and necessary repairs to public buildings could not be done. While the wealthy would continue to prosper, the rest of the population would suffer.
Not surprisingly, the appeal to sympathy didn’t work. The tax protest grew. Some Democrats voluntarily paid their taxes—but they paid them to the McEnery government. To combat this, Kellogg’s legislature instituted a variety of harsh penalties and punishments to be carried out by both civil and criminal prosecutions. People had ten days after being given written or published notice to pay their taxes. If they failed to do so, their property could be seized and sold. The delinquent taxpayer had no legal recourse.
The penalties were enforced. For example, Edward Booth, supposedly a state senator in the people’s legislature, was arrested when he refused to pay a hundred-dollar licensing fee for his hat shop on Magazine Street. After one day being “enjoined, sued, arrested, fined, imprisoned, seized, closed,” he announced he was forced to “ransom my person from imprisonment.” He paid his taxes and was released.
His resistance had emboldened Democrats, and as he left the prison he was greeted by hundreds of cheering people. Led by a band and marching four abreast, a long procession snaked through the city streets. It was a glorious celebration. Spectators cheered from the walks or leaned out of windows, waving hats and handkerchiefs until his carriage stopped in front of his store. Standing on a box he quoted Benjamin Franklin, who said about British taxation before the Revolution, “It is better and cheaper to pay nineteen shillings to defend one shilling than to surrender one shilling to save nineteen.”
Following the impromptu rally, a straw figure labeled Wm. P. Kellogg was raised on a lamppost and hung by its neck. People threw stones at the effigy, beat it with sticks and finally set it ablaze. When it was reduced to a pile of ashes, a placard was placed in front, reading, Here fell Wm. P. Kellogg, the usurper.
The New Orleans Times-Picayune, among the leading advocates for the strike, adamantly refused to pay more than $2,150 in overdue taxes. In late April tax collector N. C. Folger published a notice that he intended to sell “at public auction...the name, good will, presses, types, material, stock in trade, right and credits” owned by the publishing company for “cash on the spot.”
A day before the auction the newspaper paid its bill.
But by then the tax strike had taken hold. In early May the newspapers listed the names and tax debts of hundreds and hundreds of people, in preparation for seizing their property. Henry Warmoth’s name did not appear on the lists.
The contested election had led to rancorous debate, substantial violence and now a tax strike. The bitterness, frustration and anger had continued escalating, without relief, for more than a year. And now, finally, it was about to explode.
What happened next would reverberate throughout American history for the next century.

There was no place in the state of Louisiana that did not suffer from the political turmoil. No place.
The town of Colfax was three hundred and fifty miles from New Orleans, although it barely qualified as a town. It consisted of four or five houses, several of which offered rooms to passing travelers, three stores, a schoolhouse and one brick building, a stable that had been converted into the parish courthouse.
Colfax served as the seat, the administrative center, of Grant Parish. The parish and the town had been carved out of four adjoining parishes in 1868, as much to provide additional political patronage as for any other reason, and had been named after President Grant and his vice president, Schuyler Colfax. Grant Parish had an estimated forty-five hundred residents, many of them freedmen who now worked the fields for a wage. Politically, it was split roughly evenly between the two parties.
The area had once been part of the sprawling Calhoun Plantation. In the late 1830s Meredith Calhoun purchased as many as a thousand slaves in Huntsville, Alabama, the majority of them teenagers, and brought them chained or yoked together in a half-mile-long caravan to Louisiana. It was believed to be the largest overland movement of slaves in cotton industry history, requiring one hundred wagons and a thousand mules.
He brought them to an unusually lush area on the banks of the Red River. It was estimated the fertile soil could produce as much as a bale and a half of cotton or forty bushels of corn per acre. Calhoun’s slaves cleared an estimated twelve thousand acres, cutting trees, shrubs and bush, filling swamps, and using the timber to build magnificent homes for the masters as well as rudimentary slave quarters. They also built the second-largest sugar refinery in the country. The abundant cotton harvests and sugar revenue from his plantations made Meredith Calhoun wealthy enough to live in splendor in Europe, where he purchased a title, Count Calhoun, from France.
Calhoun had no moral qualms about slavery and was known for imposing brutal punishments to maintain control. Author Harriet Beecher Stowe supposedly said that the villainous slave master she depicted in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Simon Legree, was based at least partially on Meredith Calhoun.
Through the early years of the Civil War, Calhoun remained confident that England and France, in need of the South’s cotton and sugar, would break the Union’s naval blockade. But Lincoln’s Red River campaign, with its fifty-boat flotilla, ended that belief. When the Union army arrived, almost four hundred thousand slaves declared themselves war contraband, walked off Southern plantations and surrendered to the Union Army. Nearly half of them enlisted to fight for their freedom.
Meredith died in 1869 and by the beginning of Reconstruction, what remained of the once-vast plantations were being run by his son William. “Willie” Calhoun was a hunchback who committed the most grievous act possible by a Southern gentleman: he fell in love with a mixed-race woman named Olivia Williams. Following the war, reported the Shreveport Times, Calhoun had gone to New Orleans to purchase mules and supplies. While there he met “a handsome mulatto girl, became enamored of her and sought to win her to his soft embraces...
“The enraptured hunchback was forced to pay down to the mother five thousand dollars...and in a short time married his concubine in the most approved fashion.”
Rather than hiding this socially scandalous relationship, Willie and Olivia were married in New Orleans’s St. Louis Cathedral. As a result of this as well as several other civil rights programs he sponsored, Willie Calhoun gained the loyalty of the freedmen, among them many of his former slaves, and became a leader of the national Republican party. Supposedly, Grant Parish was created at his behest.
By 1872 the Calhoun plantations were in disarray, mortgaged for far greater sums than their current worth. Most of the fields were abandoned, fences were down, farm buildings were falling into disrepair, and the animal herds were gone. Willie Calhoun was rumored to be bankrupt.
Situated literally hundreds of miles from the political rancor of New Orleans, a rural place like Colfax might seem immune from the dangers created by a shattered government. But it wasn’t. Like a slowly spreading poison, the mayhem reached every part of the state.
Grant Parish was racially divided; its Black and white residents settled comfortably among their own folk. Most of the freedmen lived in and around Colfax, many of them in the former slave quarters on the nearby Smithfield Plantation. White residents generally built their homesteads in the hills or farmed land along the boundaries of the parish, as much as twenty to forty miles from the village, but the small white settlement of Montgomery was only about twelve miles away. As a result, the substantial Black population was surrounded by white farmers. The races generally didn’t socialize, but they mostly peacefully tolerated each other’s presence.
There was no reason to suspect that a torrent of Black blood would soon flow through the parish.
The seeds of conflict were planted in
