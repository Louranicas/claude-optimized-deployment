# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Travis DeForge - Ultimate Penetration Testing with Nmap_ Master Cybersecurity Assessments for Network Security, Monitoring, and Scanning Using N (2024, Orange Education Pvt Ltd, AVA™) - libgen.li
Chapter: 8 - Leveraging the Nmap Scripting Engine.
For now, it is sufficient to simply understand that there are a large number of scripts that have added additional features and functionality to Nmap over time; these scripts can be implemented in very creative ways, and they can be combined with additional flags to modify them even further.
Experimenting with and researching different NSE scripts provides an eye-opening experience into seeing how other security researchers have solved individual challenges. Often times, this will lead to solutions to problems that you didn’t even realize you had. Throughout the next several chapters, we will be leveraging dozens of individual NSE scripts to accomplish specific objectives.
Intermediate Nmap Flags
The basic flags that we discussed in Chapter 3: Introduction to Attack Surface Mapping have provided you with the capability to conduct fundamental scans. We discussed how to adjust the timing, specify which type of enumeration (that is, operating system, ports and services, and so on), adjust verbosity, and utilize input and output files to increase efficiency. However, those represent only a small fraction of the potential modifications you can use to tailor your Nmap scans. The following 12 flags are designed to take your basic scans and bring them up to the next level by adding more capabilities and nuanced control over how they operate:

--script: Among the most powerful features of Nmap is the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). We have seen a brief display of the different capabilities of NSE scripts already when we analyzed vulnerabilities using the vulners.nse script; however, there are hundreds of additional scripts available which dramatically expand the capacity of Nmap. We will be taking a deep dive into NSE scripts and how to write them in Lua in
