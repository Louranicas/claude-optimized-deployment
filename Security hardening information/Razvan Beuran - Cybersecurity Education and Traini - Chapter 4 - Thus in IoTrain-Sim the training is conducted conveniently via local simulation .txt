Thus, in IoTrain-Sim the training is conducted conveniently via local simulation, whereas IoTrain-Lab requires to access remotely the IoT testbed, which needs to be shared with potentially many other users, hence occasional unavailability may occur. In IoTrain-Sim, in addition to tutorials, predefined simulation scenarios are available, but for IoTrain-Lab only the tutorials are available, and the practical experiments must be created and conducted step-by-step by trainees. While the knowledge level required to use IoTrain-Sim is low, some basic command-line skills and fundamental networking knowledge are required in the case of IoTrain-Lab. No registration is needed to use IoTrain-Sim, but for IoTrain-Lab registering on FIT IoT-LAB is necessary, although this only has to be done in the beginning by the course instructor, and the use is free of charge for academic use.Table 7.4Differences between IoTrain-Sim and IoTrain-LabFeaturesIoTrain-SimIoTrain-LabTraining typeLocal simulationRemote testbedTraining materialsTutorials, predefined simulationsTutorials onlyRequired knowledgeLowLow-to-mediumPrerequisite registrationNoFor FIT IoT-LABDevice typesSimulated devicesReal devicesSupported devices3 sensor types, 1 actuator type13 IoT board typesSupported OSsContiki OSFreeRTOS, RIOT, Contiki-NG, etc.Device mobilityNot availableAvailable via robots
