# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Iqbal H. Sarker - AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence_ Cyber Automation, Intelligent Decision-Making and Explainability (2024, Springer) - libgen.li
Chapter: 7 - focuses on how AI-driven cybersecurity can play a key role in 
enhancing 
the resilience of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city ecosystems. 
Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices, these interconnected 
networks have become an integral part of urban infrastructure. Using artiﬁcial 
intelligence, particularly machine learning algorithms, enables proactive threat detection, anomaly identiﬁcation, and rapid response to emerging cyber risks. The 
AI models can adapt to evolving attack vectors, analyze the massive streams of 
data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT), and distinguish normal patterns from potential security breaches. The transformative approach not only mitigates known 
threats but also uncovers new vulnerabilities in smart city applications. Overall, AI-
driven cybersecurity protects IoT and smart city infrastructures against sophisticated cyber threats by continuously learning and evolving, thereby fostering a secure and 
resilient urban digital landscape.
