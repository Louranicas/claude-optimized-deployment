7.2.2 Theoretical TrainingAs mentioned already in Sect. 3.​1.​4 in relation with general cybersecurity training, there are approaches to education and training that focus on knowledge, as opposed to practical skills. Therefore, we will discuss this aspect next in the context of IoT by examining two categories of theoretical IoT security training:Online courses.Tabletop exercises.
7.2.2.1 Online CoursesWhile the hands-on training approaches discussed so far are most effective for teaching practical IoT security skills, the range of IoT technologies is very vast, necessitating a large amount of knowledge. A straightforward way to acquire such knowledge is by taking online courses that provide relevant information on IoT security topics. We emphasize, however, that such courses need to be supplemented with hands-on exercises in order to ensure that skill development occurs as well.One example in the online course category is Cybersecurity and the Internet of Things, which is provided by Coursera [9]. The course addressed mainly security and privacy issues regarding IoT technologies, e.g., in relation with consumer wearables and connected homes, that are taught in a practical and interactive manner, such as via case studies and quizzes. The course is provided in an instructor-led manner and has an estimated completion duration of approximately 11 h.Another related online course is offered on the GetSmarter learning platform under the name Internet of Things: Business Implications and Opportunities [16]. Instead of focusing on technical topics, this course provides a business management perspective on IoT, for example, dealing with business strategy and operation aspects in relation with IoT technologies. This course is provided in an instructor-led manner as well and has an estimated completion duration of 36 to 48 h.
7.2.2.2 Tabletop ExercisesThe relatively low involvement of learners in online courses is one of their main disadvantages. Therefore, the concept of tabletop training–that is, organizing training sessions in which participants discuss their roles and responses in a given cybersecurity scenario—has also been applied to the area of IoT security training. Specific issues in this context are the fact that in the world of IoT cyber threats can have physical impacts, and physical threats can have cyber impacts, with potentially serious consequences, especially in domains such as industrial IoT.An example in this case is the card game named IoT-Poly [21]. The game uses four types of cards that correspond to IoT systems, attack surfaces, threats and countermeasures. The players use the cards they receive initially, and others they draw from the deck, to conduct a risk assessment on a given IoT system based on three phases: risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation, including aspects such as residual risks. Discussions between players make it possible for them to evaluate each other’s decisions and share knowledge within the group.

7.2.3 Approach ComparisonTo better clarify the differences between the IoT security training approaches that we discussed so far, we conducted a comparative analysis of their main characteristics from several perspectives: typical target participants, interactivity, and whether an instructor is available or not. The comparison is summarized in Table 7.1, where some comments about each approach are also provided in the last column.Table 7.1Comparison of IoT security training approachesApproachTypeParticipantsInteractivityInstructorCommentsAcademic trainingHands-onMainlystudentsHighYesTypically require student statusCommercial trainingHands-onMainlyprofessionalsHighYesPotentially high attendance costsTraining systemsHands-onStudents andprofessionalsMediumNoBased on custom hardware, expensiveOnline coursesTheoreticalStudents andprofessionalsLowIf yes,remotelyConvenient to attendTabletop exercisesTheoreticalStudents andprofessionalsHighYesDevelop soft skills (team building, etc.)
7.2.3.1 Comparative AnalysisThe upper part of Table 7.1 includes the three hands-on training approaches that we discussed. For academic training, the target participants are mainly students, whereas commercial training typically targets professionals. Training systems, on the other hand, can be used both by students and professionals. As for the lower part of the table, which includes the two theoretical training approaches we discussed, both approaches are addressed to students as well as professionals.Regarding interactivity aspects, hands-on training approaches have in general a high level of interactivity, since the trainees must be deeply involved in the training in order to perform the practical tasks included. However, we have marked the interactivity of academic and commercial training as “high” compared to the “medium” label for training systems to account for the fact that instructors are present in those cases, whereas for training systems the activity is typically conducted by the trainees themselves, without any instructor support. In the case of online courses, interactivity is low, since such courses consist mainly in watching training videos. On the other hand, tabletop training requires active discussions between participants, hence they are also highly interactive.Instructors are an important part of the training process, and they are available for most academic and commercial IoT security training programs. In contrast, the business model for training systems is to sell those systems to customers, who conduct the training by themselves. This is perhaps the biggest disadvantage of this approach, although it can be compensated by having experienced users in an organization act as instructors for the less experienced trainees. Online courses represent a special case from an instructor involvement perspective. Thus, for many of the online courses, there is no instructor available; but even for those courses that are advertised as “instructor led,” the instructor is only available remotely, and interactivity is typically limited to message exchanges, without face-to-face communication. As for tabletop exercises, instructors are generally those who moderate the training activity, provide advice when needed, etc.We also included in Table 7.1 several comments about each approach that hint at their potential advantages and disadvantages. For academic training, we note that student status is typically required to take those courses, which is a potential barrier to attendance. There are, however, academic courses that are available to non-degree learners (for a fee), thus eliminating this barrier. As for commercial training, the attendance costs are potentially high; one could consider, however, that these costs are counterbalanced by the fact that some of the commercial training programs provide completion certificates that can be used professionally, for example for job hunting or promotion purposes. Training systems are often based, at least partially, on custom hardware, hence purchase costs can be high; these costs can nevertheless be amortized over time if enough members of an organization use the training system. The main advantage of online courses is that they are convenient to attend due to their online nature, and can be done in a self-paced manner, hence are an easier way to gain background knowledge compared to other approaches. With regard to tabletop exercises, their discussion-based nature helps develop soft skills, such as team building, for which there is no equivalent in the other training approaches, which are fundamentally conducted individually.
7.2.3.2 DiscussionWe also note that sometimes it is difficult to clearly place a specific system in one of the training categories discussed so far. For example, the training system presented in [6] uses an industrial system physical model to give students a factory-related IoT training experience. For this purpose, the system includes several manufacturing components, such as sensors, motors, and conveyor belts. While this system is developed in the academic world, it is also a hardware-based training system, as those described in Sect. 7.2.1.
