Book: Iqbal H. Sarker - AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence_ Cyber Automation, Intelligent Decision-Making and Explainability (2024, Springer) - libgen.li
Chapter: 2 - provides a foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts, 
including terminologies and attack frameworks like the cyber kill chain and MITRE ATT&CK, as well as the cybersecurity life cycle. In this chapter, key 
terms regarding threats, vulnerabilities, security controls, and relevant emerging 
technologies associated with AI are clariﬁed, enabling effective communication 
within the cybersecurity ﬁeld. Furthermore, the cybersecurity life cycle emphasizes 
a systematic approach to cybersecurity management, emphasizing risk assessment, continuous monitoring, and adaptive security measures. The purpose of this chapter 
is to provide readers with the knowledge and understanding necessary to navigate 
the complex landscape of cybersecurity with a strategic and informed perspective, 
providing a solid foundation for further exploration. 
In Chap. 3, a comprehensive look at learning technologies such as machine 
learning and deep learning algorithms is presented, emphasizing how they can 
be used for the intelligent analysis of data and automation in cybersecurity by 
extracting valuable insights from cyber data. We explore several real-world use 
cases where data-driven intelligence, automation, and decision-making enable 
next-generation cyber protection. Our study highlights the prospects of learning 
technologies in cybersecurity, along with relevant research directions. The goal is to 
explore not only the current state of machine learning, deep learning, and relevant methodologies but also their potential for future cybersecurity breakthroughs. 
In Chap. 4, a comprehensive empirical analysis of various models based on 
machine learning is presented. A binary classiﬁcation model is used for detecting anomalies, while a multi-class classiﬁcation model is used for different types of 
cyberattacks. The security model is built using ten of the most popular machine 
learning classiﬁcation techniques, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, 
stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision 
trees, random forests, adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and linear 
discriminant analysis. After that, we present the multilayered artiﬁcial neural 
network-based security model. A range of experiments based on the two most 
popular security datasets, UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, are conducted to assess 
the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. The purpose of this
