Be aware that the free tier may not provide enough RAM for production use and will not be suitable for running Kali
    


      Linux images.
     




     Kali Linux provides
    



     documentation and marketplace images for running on AWS, Digital Ocean, Linode, and Azure (
    


      https://www.kali.org/docs/cloud/
     


     ).
    

     I have experience with customers who have configured Kali in the cloud for cloud security assessments, or connected via VPN to their internal network infrastructure to facilitate internal network pentests.
    

     If the customer’s internal network is already connected to a cloud provider over VPN, it’s relatively easy for them to spin up a Kali image and create a firewall rule to allow SSH access from my IP address.
    

     Now that we’ve explored options for running a pentesting system with Bash, let’s discover a few vulnerable systems we can use to practice within
    


      our lab.
     






     Vulnerable lab targets
    



     While following along with some of the later chapters related to pentesting methodology, it will be beneficial for
    



     you to have access to vulnerable targets when running the commands and developing your Bash scripts.
    

     There are several great sources of vulnerable targets you can use for practice in
    


      your lab.
