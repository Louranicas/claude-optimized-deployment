Chapter: 24 - Since each octet in an IPv4 IP address can have a range between 0 and 255, the “0/24” indicates that the final octet can have any value between 0 and 255. As the /# decreases, the total number of possible IP addresses increases exponentially. While you can subnet all the way down to a /31 network, which is only 1 IP address, by far, the most commonly seen are /24, /16, and /8.

Since each octet in an IPv4 IP address can have a range between 0 and 255, the “0/24” indicates that the final octet can have any value between 0 and 255. As the /# decreases, the total number of possible IP addresses increases exponentially. While you can subnet all the way down to a /31 network, which is only 1 IP address, by far, the most commonly seen are /24, /16, and /8.

Table 5.1: Subnet breakdown by IP address
You can immediately see that the difference between these subnet sizes is enormous. The good news is that just because a client provides you with a /16 subnet in the scope of your pentest does not mean they have 65 thousand devices. The vast majority of the possible /24 subnets within that /16 will likely be empty. The challenge becomes, how do you figure out where the actual endpoints are in that large range? Certainly, you cannot perform a stealthy port scan of the top 1,000 ports on 65 thousand individual IP addresses; if you tried, the whole engagement would likely be over before the scan finishes! Remember, penetration testers are time-bound in ways that real hackers are not. This inherent limitation necessitates us to be very strategic in how we map the environment.
Different clients will provide different levels of information when defining the scope. In some instances, you will get a very well-defined and labeled spreadsheet of subnets (and/or VLANs) that are organized. In other cases, you may be provided with just a single (or small number of) larger subnet. For example, a client could provide you with the following neat and organized table, or just “10.10.0.0/16”:

Table 5.2: Ideal scope chart
In this simplistic example, a /16 would be valid as those /24 subnets are certainly subdivided from the 10.10.0.0/16 subnet; but in reality, only 2295 IP address spaces are being utilized compared to the 65,536 technically possible.
It is much faster and easier when the client simply provides the breakdown, as shown in Table 5.
