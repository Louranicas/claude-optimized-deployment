Chapter: 2020 - The number of social media users is increasing as Wi-FI expands global connectivity and establishes and maintains proper social media accounts beneficial to businesses. Social network accounts provide benefits and risks. In 2018, 50 million Facebook users’ login information was compromised by hackers. Despite these incidents, companies must maintain an online presence as e-transactions replace traditional transactions, such as buying and selling.
Social Network Reviewed
Online social networking sites (OSN) are tools utilized by billions of individuals, businesses, and innovators worldwide. An online social networking service is defined as a service-oriented system designed to help the consumer connect and interact in cyberspace through a common connectivity portal. In addition, OSN is helpful to researchers because of the rich array of information content available for mining and insights.
Social network organizations are essential in increased business productivity and the progressive discovery of academic research disciplines. In addition, new information gleaned from social networks helps to provide many opportunities for modern development in many areas of commerce and education. OSN was initially developed to help individuals stay in contact with one another; however, the number of users who converged to interact made social media website platforms virtual marketplaces. Indeed, the social networking dynamic influence seems to be very progressive from the perspective of e-commerce.
Marketers have discovered that social media platforms are new and exciting business tools designed to target potential customers and increase market shares. However, social engineering tactics could expose users’ information to unauthorized persons who trade information for illegal gains and ruin the reputation of the information owners in the process. Facebook is one of the social network organizations which is known for breaching the privacy of its users. In a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C., in 2018, Facebook leadership was questioned about how the organization’s leaders used customers’ misused information. Facebook is considered the de facto of social networking. Nevertheless, Facebook is well-known for sharing and promoting ideas that individuals, businesses, and researchers find valuable.
Social networks’ hegemony will attract ambitious nascent entrepreneurs and criminals who will produce software that can attack legitimate users and steal their identities by cloning profiles. There are two sophisticated threats that users should be aware of. These threats are modern threats and classical threats. (1) Modern threats target OSN users since OSNs can compromise security and privacy. (2) Classical threats target OSN users as well as individuals who do not use OSNs. Privacy settings are designed to give users control over their information; however, privacy settings have protected users as expected.
Even though some Facebook users have applied the private setting feature to their profiles, their information remains vulnerable to potential threats. Protection is challenging in an interconnectivity environment. Once a user joins a public group or connects with others on their domain, they are vulnerable if the public domain is not sufficiently secure. Privacy and safety are major concerns for users of healthcare and financial services. When individuals use online search engines to locate health solutions, the search factor exposes3 the searcher to cybercriminals. The more information users share about themselves, the more attractive their profiles are to cybercriminals. Although privacy settings offer some protection, customers’ personal data may still be exposed without the owners’ consent.
Social Network and Cyberattacks
Let us review the impacts of cyberattacks and try to understand what is responsible for their propagation. By evaluating cybersecurity literature around cyber-harm, we get the sense that most cyberbreaches occur through technological ignorance. Researchers cited that the lack of knowledge about how careless exposure of private information could impact users is one of the main reasons for most cyberattacks. A limited understanding of possible cyberattacks may unwittingly lead to the selection of risk factors. To mitigate the impact of social network risk on users, social users, researchers, and business users must equip themselves with the appropriate knowledge concerning cyberattacks to facilitate the adequate development of risk treatments.
Awareness of Cybersecurity Threats among IT Professionals
E-commerce business leaders have identified cyberattacks through social network mediums as a big challenge online entities face. Given the immensity of online transactions, e-commerce officials must adopt the necessary measures to protect the cache of data in their custody. Some systems they use to protect data from intrusions include intrusion prevention systems, intrusion detection systems, packet-shaping devices, and firewalls. In addition, in light of the frequency of cyberattacks through social media, e-commerce cybersecurity experts recommended that online business participants acquire security assessment services, which offer guidelines on protecting applications, implementing systems, and securing networks from attacks.
Social networks have changed the technological landscape through their product offerings, big data collection, mobile computing, and the ease of global connectivity. Government regulations aimed at strengthening data protection by using principles such as the purpose of use and consent limitations have become urgent, given the right to data portability, privacy, and profitability. Government legislation should steer social network organizations in the direction of how personal data should be handled to assure users that their private information is not being traded for financial profits without their knowledge. The aspect of privacy in personal data handling can no longer be treated lightly. Organizational freedom to use customers’ data by attaching a legal loophole or so-called fine print should not be allowed. Every customer should be confident that the custodians of their private information are not using it for their self-interest.
Social Network Security Threats
Increased social network technology has resulted in data security threats due to high usage levels. Cyberspace has become crowded, which seems to increase opportunities for cybercriminals as businesses and organizations are increasingly transferring more of their operations online. Cybersecurity software developers reiterated that cybercrimes continue to escalate because hackers develop and spread new strains of malware daily. AV-TEST Institute registers approximately 450,000 new malicious programs or malware each day. SonicWall, a cybersecurity provider company, detected 9.9 million attacks on internet users in 2019. The number of attacks in 2018 was 10.5 million; thus, a decrease suggested that cybersecurity was improving. Notwithstanding the progress, approximately 100,000 known computer viruses are lurking on the internet, waiting to attack unsuspecting users. This malware is part of a criminal network designed to steal individual and company data. For example, hackers who employ malicious software to access the logins and passwords of bank customers use unauthorized access to steal cash and other financial assets such as bonds from bank customers. In addition, many users stay connected to social media, which is a dangerous practice. Users should log off the social network for cybersecurity protection when not using their accounts.
Privacy breaches have proliferated because social networks trade customers’ information to advertisers. With the emergence of neural networks, a metric can be developed to measure the extent to which social networks use users’ privacy. Neural networks could help eliminate the manipulation of social network users’ privacy abuse.
Deliberate Attacks on Social Media Platforms
Cyberattacks on social media are deliberate attempts by cybercriminal networks to harvest usable data that they trade for cash or other valuable merchandise. Attacks on social media aim to disrupt the current flow of information and pressure security systems. Social media is a rich source of information assets; thus, social media is a fertile ground for cyberattacks, given the increased number of platforms available.
Advanced technology has prompted businesses to maintain an online presence through personal websites or social media platforms. Therefore, many companies do most of their transactions online, ranging from orders, payments, tracking, and deliveries. In this e-business environment, many businesses exist solely online without office facilities. Hackers roam social media platforms, seeking hidden treasures because users have an inherent trust in their social media providers. Thus, cybercriminals exploit the trust for illegal opportunities. Cybercrimes tend to occur when the attacker installs ransomware and malicious software that can encrypt the private information of unsuspecting persons’ or organizations’ computers, electronics, and/or mobile systems.
As previously mentioned, social network organizations encounter many types of cyberattacks, including ransomware, phishing, and malware. Malware may allow hackers to control the user’s computer from a remote location and steal valuable content. Phishing permits the attacker to design and attach a corrupted email link to deceive the targeted users. They may open the email intended to encrypt the users’ data files. The program is built with a component to prompt the user to contact a paid repair “expert” to restore the files. The paid expert is the cybercriminal who sent the corrupted email.
Many social network users are skeptical of the quality of online protection available to protect their credit cards, bank cards, and details of their personal identities. Approximately 64% of Americans have been involved in a major data breach through their emails and passwords to log in to their social media websites (Smith 2017). Cybersecurity breaches have affected various users, including federal governmental agencies, businesses, and individuals linked to cyberspace. According to Pew Research, one of the most shocking breaches in the United States happened in 2016 when hackers accessed the Democratic National Committee database and released its members’ emails. Those types of breaches raise suspicion regarding the efficacy of those organizations’ cybersecurity systems.
Hackers have mastered the art of cyber impersonation by creating fake brands that look authentic. The convergence of similarity, that is, things that are close in resemblance, on social media has allowed them to duplicate and manipulate product brands and undermined customer loyalty. Hackers use fake accounts to inflate clicks and likes that automatically lure users to their page, where the user may get infected by malicious material. Attacks on social media can be external as well as internal. The external attackers could be amateurs who do not possess enough skills and seasoned experts with vast cybertechnology experiences. Sometimes the cyberattackers are terrorists seeking to make political statements or business organizations trying to undermine their competition. Malicious links are designed to point the users to infected websites where they are tricked into sharing their confidential credentials. Also, these links spread through shared content on social media comments and direct messages to anyone who follows the impersonated accounts and brands.
Some friendships on social media have been damaged. Recently, we have experienced rage and angry exchanges of words on social media between disagreeing parties. Angry exchanges and malice have led to the posting of private information by the irate party that should not be in a public forum. This comes mainly with the recent rise in the number of people using social media platforms. Corporate entities have found that using social network platforms to collect and analyze the data of their targeted customers for personalized marketing is a valuable strategy. Hackers are also aware of the richness of social networks’ data sources and have invented new schemes to help them share the potential benefits.
The intensity of cyberattacks on social media is growing while the technical abilities of cybersecurity tools like malware are also evolving. Evolving malware has facilitated new cybercrimes on network platforms. For example, crypto-mining malware attacks digital currencies like bitcoin and is emerging from the intensity of cyberattack tools. This cybercriminal tool exploits users. Thus, the urgency to prioritize cybersecurity needs to protect against cyberattacks aimed at breaching personal and business networks. Organizations and individuals that are using social network should come to the realization that security should be layered since a slight loophole could cause a significant data breach, resulting in untold damages and losses to the victim.
Facebook the Social Network Usership
By the third quarter of 2021, Facebook reported that the company had approximately 2.91 billion monthly registered users, making Facebook the biggest social network organization. In recent times, employers and employees have converged in the same social network space. This convergence of common space made sharing information on social media risky, especially when it relates to employees’ personal lives and employment. In other words, employees need to be cautious about the type of information they post on social network platforms. Based on several news reports, many employees who have posted personal information unrelated to their jobs have gotten in trouble with their employers. A post that got an employee fired may not have been work-related but may have impugned the employee’s character. The information a user posts on social networks could have serious immediate repercussions and harm future opportunities.
The Liability of an On-line Post
Social network users should be aware of their posts because a single post could have far-reaching consequences. For example, a post intended for mere jesting could become a liability for the person who posted the information. Researchers have compiled data from several sources regarding social media’s effects on college students regarding interconnection and sharing. These studies revealed that college students’ self-concepts increased by connecting with peers on social media. Also, social networking platforms are popular because students spend much time hanging out on social media as pastime activities. In addition, social media is used in many cases to help people feel connected and informed. Furthermore, social media maintains and sustains relationships among peers, friends, and family. Some studies have indicated that college students form a large percentage of users on social media networks. Approximately 72% of college students are on social media, and 45% use social media at least once a day (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, and Zickuhr 2010). In addition, college students appear to be technology savvy and aware of online posting consequences, including cybersecurity dangers.
Social media organizations and big corporations profit from watching users’ search interests. Therefore, social networks like Facebook and cell phone companies such as AT&T and Verizon track users’ transactions and use the information to market their customers. This invasion of privacy is because companies are allowed to do whatever they can within specific guidelines to maximize profits. Social network users should be aware that to minimize cybersecurity crimes, they can avoid cloud backup programs, use private browsers, block cookie pop-ups, and turn off location services when not needed.
Social media platforms are not lawless forums; abusers may be persecuted. Social media use has skyrocketed, and so too are the levels of law enforcement surveillance. Thus, users should understand that using social media platforms comes with responsibilities. Users of social media platforms ought to abide by ethical disciplines and laws to avoid persecution. The World Wide Web is the new information superhighway, meaning that traditional transactions have migrated to cyberspace. Now that technology has become widespread, and the cost is lower, law enforcement has escalated to provide safety, accountability, and transparency. Social media information is valuable because it is public, and public information requires a high level of efficacy. Social media users want to interact with friends openly without being bombarded with unpleasant streaming and fake news.
Cyber-experts described threat modeling as a process that identifies and prioritizes threats from the cybercriminal’s standpoint. In other words, threat modeling is a type of forecasting like SWOT analysis. Threat modeling gives service providers an idea of where cybercriminals are likely to attack. Once service providers have an estimation of the possible area of attack, they can examine that area keenly for loopholes and apply layers of security and patches where applicable. Technicians and systems errors appear to be a big problem regarding cybersecurity. Therefore, by engaging the forecasting methodology, the cybersecurity management team can discover potential issues before they occur. By utilizing the threat modeling concept, organizations can get a heads-up on potential threats to their cybersecurity systems. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving; therefore, the use of upgraded threat modeling systems may help reduce and, in some cases, prevent cybercriminal activities.
Chapter Summary
Companies worldwide use social networking platforms for convenient advertising and business promotions. Given that no obvious upfront costs are using social media to promote small entrepreneurial endeavors, it has become popular. Social media is an effective method of advertising for many nascent entrepreneurs. While social network platforms provide innumerable economic benefits, they have also proven to have some disadvantages because they are rich sources of cybersecurity invasions. The popularity of social media warrants strict global cybersecurity surveillance. Maintaining established protocols provides strong possibilities for cyberspace protection. Cybersecurity managers should use forecast techniques to predict potential cyberattacks and prepare counter cyberattack strategies. The introduction of a threat model may help to combat cybersecurity threats.
A very troublesome risk is hacking and impersonating customers’ accounts. Another risk is account duplication, where users’ accounts are duplicated to deceive the users’ trusted associates and friends. Social media platforms are taking significant steps to protect customers’ information to rebuild customers’ confidence in social network websites. Thus, leaking existing and potential customers’ personal information has become more complicated than 10 years ago, as social network providers made cybersecurity their number one priority.

CHAPTER FIVE
Biometric, Personal Privacy & Invasion of Users
Introduction

Personal privacy is the ability of an individual or organization to be selective about how they expose their private activities as well as select the information about themselves that they wish to share with others on the World Wide Web. Personal information disclosed to the World Wide Web will take on a presence of permanence. Information leaked and stored in cyberspace will remain in the system for infinity, even when the users’ accounts are closed or deleted. Experts described the concept of privacy as challenging because it may be blurry depending on the origin and access of the information. In other words, who owned it, and who got access? For instance, the data generated by a company executive as the executive conducted research and established operations policies. If the executive conducted research on the executive’s own time and used that information to set up the organization’s policies; who owned the research that the executive did not get paid for? Very often, this problem requires definitional categorization for clarity.
The CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerburg, stated in Congress that users wanted a privacy-focused social platform. Facebook is committed to complying with data protection laws and expanding tools to help users manage their privacy. Facebook users will become more comfortable sharing their private information online once they are confident that the social media outlet is protecting their personal data. Biometrics measure and calculate the physical attributes of unique human features. Biometric features are used as authentication in many ways, including electronic devices. Instead of using written passwords, some systems use the unique features of individuals to gain digital access to their devices or gain entry to their premises or restricted domain. An advance in biometric technology related to data protection is known as cancelable biometrics—the intentional repeating and distorting of biometric features as a test ensures that it maintains its user-specific characteristics.
A basic example of biometrics can be seen in the iPhone 11, a device made by the Apple Corporation. This phone uses facial recognition features to allow its owners access to its personal data. Thus, applying biometrics-based privacy-preserving authentication as the device access mechanism and enhanced mobile template protection for users. Furthermore, as cybersecurity requires stronger protection mechanisms, facial features and fingerprints have become a common means of authentication to access a computer and mobile devices and build access.
Biometric technology primarily protects private and sensitive information from unauthorized access and prevents data compromises that could harm the owners. The lack of high-technological protection, such as biometrics and other technical safety precautions, could result in data breaches that could ruin the reputations of outstanding organizations. Many people value their cybersafety regarding the use of personal information they share on social media. People tend to trust their social network platforms to protect their privacy and prevent their information from falling into the domain of hackers.
The protection motivation theory (PMT) sheds light on how to create an effective protection system. It essentially measures decision-makers’ willingness to implement strategies that could protect users’ online privacy. PMT is vital in advancing technological strides and other aspects of biometric technology. Cybersecurity management emphasized the relevance of the PMT in light of privacy threats. It underscored the PMT framework as a valuable tool for regulators who seek greater insights into privacy protection accountability. The protection of privacy begins with the owner of the information.
Information owners should use all the legitimate means necessary to secure their private information. Furthermore, information owners should hold individuals and organizations that they have given custody of their information accountable. People tend to have confidence that the organization protects the information they share with that organization within the capacity of business transactions. Privacy protection behavior is influenced by the organization’s attitude toward the value of privacy and cybersecurity budgets.
Internet privacy is desired by users of social platforms or web-based organizations primarily because private and personal information is being disseminated widely, which creates the potential for exploitation by cybercrooks. The difficulties with information control are the variety of sharing, collecting, and using the same information by numerous entities. For instance, one person’s credit card details are shared by many organizations. Moreover, sharing personal information online sometimes causes the information owner to lose control of the data.
The volume of information on the internet and the consistent growth of the information stream continue to perplex internet security developers as the challenge to secure internet data becomes more complex as new users add more transactions for social and business purposes. In addition, users’ concerns about online privacy are building as people worry about possible misuse of their personal information. Mishandling or misusing customers’ personal information could lead to data breaches and identity theft. Biometric technology is one of the explored mediums for greater use in data protection.
Implementing biometrics can provide a strong firewall against unwanted cyberhackers trying to enter cyberspace, where personal information may be stored in vulnerable positions or unprotected ways. If biometrics were used the right way, data breaches would have been reduced because biometrics can protect the valuable assets of individual users and organizations. However, using unsolicited and sensitive data that is unlawfully obtained without the permission of the holder or owner could be detrimental to the organization that engages in the invasion of privacy.
The Underlying Factors

Transferring traditional transactions from traditional settings to cyberspace has advantages and disadvantages. The ease of conducting business in your own space and time is very convenient, but this ease comes with some nuisances. Individuals immediately lose control of their privacy by transferring daily transactional activities to cyberspace. Privacy seems to be the number one concern about users’ information. The question is, who has control of your private information? Once your information gets on to the World Wide Web, the identity of who is in control becomes very blurry. The peculiar features of biometrics made it a preferred option for high-impact security.
The unique characteristics of the human body, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and voice recognition, made biometrics a desirable choice for cybersecurity. Biometrics is challenging to forge owing to its peculiarity; thus, biometrics is considered one of the most reliable forms of authentication. Many organizations use this type of authentication to identify and provide access control at their secure facilities. Biometrics prevents personnel from sharing access information as well as monitoring personnel who are under surveillance. Biometric authentication has become increasingly popular as many organizations found it very dependable and reliable.
Many users have changed their written passwords to biometric authentication. Cyberspace requires users to establish usernames and personal identification numbers to set up online accounts. Users’ names and passwords or passcodes are standard requirements for internet transactions. This online protocol is designed to protect users’ accounts from unauthorized access. Users’ names and passwords are prevalent forms of primary authentication of users. Biometric authentication is one of the most prominent forms of identification used at international airports. Passports and visas used for entry into foreign countries are the primary product of biometric technology. Many travelers expressed those biometrics provide more information than is necessary for international travel.
The offer of the biometric option of authentication by Apple for the iPhone is a remarkable step-for-word for smart device protection. The iPhone has been a target of theft. Many users have lost their iPhones to criminals who stalk iPhone users. The face recognition option as authentication may create a safer environment for iPhone users. The main effort surrounding biometrics is to give users confidence that their information is secure from wanton privacy invasions. Thus, it allows users to determine to what extent they want to share their data with others.
The cybersecurity management team of organizations worldwide has been making great efforts to protect their operating and customers’ information from unwanted users, such as competitors trying to gain competitive advantages through illegitimate means. Also, cybersecurity personnel contend that employees trying to gain illegal access to information that does not relate to their work may have illicit motives. Unfortunately, many stakeholders are trying to access unauthorized information; thus, cybersecurity efforts remain a continuous challenge. Biometrics may offer secure protection for critical information such as government infrastructure access, bank records, credit card details, health records, and research laboratories. Therefore, areas of increased vulnerability where traditional password methods have been breached may find a solution with biometrics.
Some financial institutions have adopted voice recognition to enhance their banking processes, particularly for customers who are conducting mobile banking. Unique voice recognition features have enabled computer systems to determine that the person speaking is the correct account holder. In addition, voice recognition may help seniors who are not tech-savvy and have no interest in creating and remembering logins and passwords.
Internet security is the overarching element of organizations’ cybersecurity manager’s strategic plans. The ability to protect operations’ and customers’ data from internal and external unauthorized users is pertinent to every cybersecurity management team. Cybersecurity managers’ inability to secure their computer network and customer data from intrusions may decrease customers’ personal privacy. Furthermore, weak cybersecurity systems could erode customers’ confidence and ultimately lead to declining business revenues. The dynamic growth of cyber-activities, mainly the continuous addition of new internet device features which come with new vulnerabilities, requires constant examination and analysis of individuals’ and organizations’ security systems. Biometric technology provides security assurance. Therefore, it is vital that a comprehensive strategy be administered to safeguard businesses and their stakeholders.
Although biometrics is a very effective authentication system, it can burden one’s privacy because of its unique demands. In addition, the storage of fingerprints, voice, and facial recognition features could utilize significant storage capacity and increase storage costs. Advanced technological hackers may be able to capture fingerprints, thus, exposing users to identity theft. Whereas passwords must be updated and changed at frequent intervals, biometrics are life-lasting human characteristics that cannot be changed. Therefore, a compromise requires significant effort to fix.
Additionally, a practical approach to maximize data security and minimize privacy invasion is to incorporate a two-factor authentication strategy which involves a biometric scan and a password. Combining these two methods would provide maximum strength to eliminate the risk of data breaches and allow greater data security and privacy efficiency. Biometric authentication should be used with traditional passwords to guard against potential compromises.
The Problem of Biometrics Examined
In August 2019, a major breach occurred in a biometric system used by banks in the United Kingdom that Suprema managed. Suprema is a company that specializes in biometrics, security, and identity solutions for banks and other business entities. The data breach exposed the fingerprints of more than 1 million people. In addition, researchers reported that they could access nearly 28 million records of customers and staff containing sensitive information. The researchers that breached the Suprema database were not criminal hackers; their objectives were to scan ports in search of familiar IP blocks and use them to find holes in the company’s systems that could potentially lead to data breaches. Their attempt on the Suprema network was successful as they searched the company’s database Bio Star 2, which contained fingerprints and facial recognition information used to access secure facilities. If the breaches were of criminal intent, they could have resulted in a catastrophic data breach disaster. Despite the soft nature of the breach, it remained a significant event that could have jeopardized the users’ personal and financial information and ruined the image and reputation of Suprema.
Biometric technology is preferred among many cybersecurity providers because of its added layer of security options. Because multiple business functions are operating via the internet, including supply chain management, it is incumbent on organizational leaders to find the best data security system available. Cybercrimes could disrupt the supply chain process as it relies on the World Wide Web information for performance optimization. The whole supply chain process, including production, packaging, transportation, and distribution, depends on the internet. Thus, a reliable internet system determines a consistent and smooth flow of supplies.
One of the key factors affecting security within the supply chain is the lack of implementing robust cybersecurity systems. In general, the budget for cybersecurity does not receive priority. Instead, some cybersecurity managers rely on automated methods and biometrics to provide holistic protections for the supply chain. However, cyberattackers utilize many attack options; therefore, checks and balances must be observed by diligently following established protocols.
Organizations’ chiefs should clearly understand that cyberattackers will always seek an opportunity to attack supply chain activities due to the rich array of information and multiple interconnections of vendors and suppliers. Therefore, while the benefits of implementing information technology systems to manage supply chain activities are enormous, management should be mindful of the inherent risk of third-party security vulnerabilities. In addition, using a biometric data protection system may not be convenient in some parts of the supply chain; therefore, management should explore many cybersecurity options to protect the supply chain, which is the most important global economic system.
What are the possibilities that an employee’s biometrics will be breached? How can management protocol help protect employees from security exposures? Do the current laws and regulations adequately protect biometric technology? These questions are designed to provide insights into the data protection issues of biometric applications. Government intervention is necessary to establish stringent regulatory policies and laws that are sufficient to handle cases of identity theft, fraud, and unethical business practices. The compromise of personal privacy may undermine the freedom and autonomy of internet users’ offline, personal experience. Some business concerns are that big government intervention in operational data security could, by itself, be compromised. Thus, the government could access the private information of business organizations. Furthermore, intervention could slow down commercial activities with inspections and delays.
Biometric data technology is still in the initial stages of usage and development. This technology has vast potential that can be explored and may lead to greater levels of security than is presently available. Governments’ laws and regulations may not effectively provide comprehensive protection for global internet users, given the complexity of the nature of activities, cultures, traditions, languages, customs, and practices. International regulations may overlap and create contradictions. In the United States, Illinois has one of the strictest privacy laws, known as the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The law protects the public by prohibiting private entities from collecting, capturing, or obtaining biometric data of individuals without written consent and requires full disclosure of the specific use of the data within an established time limit. Despite lawmakers’ efforts to protect the public, the fact is, once personal information is shared with someone or an organization, there is no guarantee of policy and protocol adherence.
Purpose of Biometrics
Each time you visit a website, your actions are monitored through cookies and other click monitor systems. Many web monitor systems allow the watcher to see what you are scrolling on, the websites you visit, and the information you search. Biometric data protection systems cannot hide the user’s data interaction online. It can only protect the users’ stored information from unauthorized access. Users should be aware that biometrics provide a uniquely high degree of data safety because every individual has a unique set of biometric characteristics, such as facial recognition and fingerprints, that cannot identify another person. The advantage of using biometric technology is that it is highly secure; hence, the data is only available to authorized individuals. Another advantage of biometrics is that it is user-friendly and relatively easy to install. 
One of the disadvantages of biometric systems is that anyone who gets your biometric data could impersonate you in minimal ways. Even though limited, the impact could be costly. Another disadvantage is that some countries have not developed the capabilities to handle biometric systems. Therefore, it does not have a universal application. Biometrics are currently available at many international airports around the world. Airports and law enforcement are the two main entities with biometric systems in many countries. Face and finger detectors are already in use at various schools, and body scanners and digital recognition are being used at airports with the aim of expanding them to even more schools and airports, as well as other companies around the world. 
Many biometric users, especially employees, are concerned with the degree of privacy lost due to fingerprints and body scanning requirements for secure access to many plants and infrastructures. What could employers do with employees’ biometrics? (1) Give it to law enforcement when there is a crime. (2) Sell it to advertisers. (3) Use it to track employees when they move to work for the competitor. In addition, biometrics stored could be released or hacked, compromising the employee’s identity.
Technological advancements in biometrics have enabled the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to evaluate and ensure the safety of passengers. By using the biometric technology method of screening passengers, immigration officers can validate passengers’ identities through a faster digital process rather than manual ID checks. As a result, the use of biometrics has boosted aviation safety remarkably. In addition, by modernizing the verification of passenger identification in aviation, the immigration checking process has reduced long lines and processing times.
In 2015, TSA started researching biometric solutions for identity authentication purposes. The study continues to emerge and add credibility to biometric solutions. Biometric technology improves protection and performance while enhancing the quality of security and customer comfort as well. Passenger involvement in TSA’s biometric development tests is optional, and passengers may contact a TSA officer if they want the manual ID check instead.
Most international airports have adopted biometric technologies due to the accuracy rates and processing speed it delivers. Biometric technologies ease the departure phase and speed up the processing of passengers. Delta is one of the airlines that uses a so-called curb-to-gate facial recognition device at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for foreign passengers. Delta has expanded the service to Detroit Metropolitan and other airports. Many airlines operate their own biometric programs, including JetBlue, British Airways, and Lufthansa. Some benefits of using biometrics include a reduced workforce and faster boarding times.
Theory/Application/Approach
Design of the Biometric System 
The biometric system was created to satisfy the needs of the users and the demand for protection. There is a strong need for biometrics to fill the gap of security loopholes. The expanded distribution of goods and services requires extensive safety methods that can stand against cybercriminals. In the context of technological advancement, a great deal of research has been done to design a practical, precise, usable, and secure biometric authentication system for many devices, including mobile devices. The ability of customers to engage in business transactions without the fear of cyberattacks is vital for the successful delivery of goods and services.
Manufacturing companies want to ensure that there is no disruption of goods and services due to security issues that may impede their efforts to meet or exceed the expectations of their customers. The type of cybersecurity systems a business uses could cause an increase in financial growth if it boosts customers’ confidence or a financial demise if it causes a data breach. Protecting customers’ data assets is extremely important for reputation building. The protection of online privacy is an essential part of building customers’ loyalty and increasing customers’ market share. The emphasis on privacy and data protection has taken center stage as data breaches are becoming more common than in the past decades.
Managing Quality of Data Security and Goods and Services
A company’s strategic approach to handling data security, maintaining service standards, and attending to quality inspections will largely determine the company’s overall strategic corporate responsibility. Safety is a requirement; indeed, a standard requirement for producers and distributors. Therefore, companies producing goods and services should have safe and reliable products and services that will not harm people because of data breaches. Data breaches allow invaders to access customers’ digital and mobile devices and download pertinent information for their personal benefit.
Also, data breaches may allow cyber invaders to upload secret programs into customers’ systems to watch and capture intimate images and data. In general, organizations unable to secure their customers’ data will suffer severely from tarnished reputations and marketability. Tarnished reputations generally manifest in financial decline, which could lead to bankruptcy.
In 2021, the Facebook stock declined by 4.9% due to a whistleblower’s allegations regarding customers’ safety and privacy policies. Facebook, the largest social media platform in the world, was held liable for users who logged out of their accounts. Yet, their information was unprotected, inconsistent with the company’s policies.
Every online transaction presents some level of risk. Therefore, companies must exercise vigilance in safeguarding customers’ data. Organizations that do not manage the quality of their security and sustain a breach that impacts customer data may be liable for negligence in a court of law. United States courts have maintained that organizations are responsible and must be held accountable to customers for data breaches and exposure.
Monitoring Strategy
Training IT personnel to efficiently administrate, monitor, and manage online customer information is crucial in light of the intent of cyber invaders bent on criminal mischief. Innovative technologies such as biometrics and triple layers of firewall protection systems have become commonplace for many organizations. In recent times, many organizations have hired internal hackers to track and monitor their cybersecurity systems and test the performance of biometric efficacy. Many companies started their biometric security experiment with their employees. Companies generally began with a time sheet login system. Many time sheets for logging in and out of work use fingerprints.
Efficient technology will help IT officers track and monitor cybersecurity and biometric systems. Biometric security can be enhanced with proper screening and the integrity of the user. In addition, consistent monitoring by security administrators will reduce the ability of users to share their authentication with others for unauthorized purposes.
Human Resources and Biometrics
Information technology personnel responsible for the biometric authentication system should be efficient and specialized in the disciple. They should be able to offer expert knowledge and demonstrate uncompromised skills. Biometric technologists should know their job description and have the experience to deal with all technological issues. In addition, they should be able to analyze content accurately that indicates attempts of data breaches and potential privacy invasions.
Cybersecurity administrators should use motivational tactics to encourage IT personnel to be vigilant about their work and the information they share. Cyber professionals participating in online activities are knowledgeable, thoroughly trained, well-informed, and aware of the depth of risks involved when a breach occurs. Thus, there is a need for countermeasures to protect their identities and their organizations’ information assets. Cybersecurity administrators provide incentives to keep these workers within the organization, where their talents and skills are valued.
Supply Chain Management and Data Security
Management of the supply chain is a significant part of the cybersecurity program. The system must be free from unwanted interruptions to maintain a seamless supply chain flow. Therefore, cybersecurity administrators should take all necessary steps to prevent data compromises. All components entering data into the supply chain network should be vetted to ensure there is no possibility for invasions. Cybersecurity professionals should develop relationships and partnerships with their firewall developers to be confident that their firewalls are made to protect their interests. The developer with access to the firewall codes must be trustworthy.
Organizations are increasingly interconnected to share resources and increased efficiency. Cybercriminals are aware of these connections and seek to find a weak link to exploit. For example, a third-party vendor was the weak link in Target’s 2013 breach, where cybercriminals stole 40 million credit and debit cards and 70 million customers’ records. One of the ways to identify security risks is to focus on the software security developers. Firewall codes must be in the custody of national experts who respect the laws, are ethically responsible, and are serious about data protection.
Organizations are primarily responsible for protecting the data of their employees, customers, and network alliances. Hence, they should invest in efficient, secure hardware and software solutions that protect this vast information of assets from cyber invaders. In addition, organizations should ensure that security updates are done regularly to close potential software leaks. Unfortunately, cybercriminals continue to build new software that can mimic authentic software. In many cases, users cannot discern the difference between these programs. That is why a vigilant and effective cybersecurity team must be on hand at times to verify suspicious programs.
A secure management supply chain system helps to improve the planning process, optimize distribution, sustain inventory levels, make timely deliveries, reduce costs, and increase the market value for participants within the chain. Cyber management of the supply chain works hard to prevent cyberattacks that may undermine the supply chain. Cyberattacks have the potential to inflict physical damage and disrupt manufacturing infrastructures. Therefore, it is imperative that the cybersecurity team assigned to critical infrastructure implement smart solutions capable of detecting and reporting performance inconsistencies from preliminary intrusions. Hence, essential components of operations management should be reviewed.
The goal of operation management is to maximize efficiency within the manufacturing processes and efficiently utilize human resources to enhance the supply chain. The movement of supply chain activities toward an effective and reliable smart solution is key to success. Talented decision-makers must implement rigid cybersecurity systems, enhance production planning, and monitor firewall security updates. Supply chain management (SCM) solutions may create optimal plans for using existing smart technological systems. Smart manufacturing aims to create highly customizable products with higher quality and lower costs by integrating technical features like the internet of things.
The interrelationships between the World Wide Web and cybersecurity pose potential manufacturing risks. The manufacturing industry is an essential link in the supply chain because production is the beginning of the supply chain. The adaption of smart technology is making waves in manufacturing. The manufacturing process involves advanced sensing systems, artificial intelligence, and wireless technologies. The paradigm shift in manufacturing leads to greater productivity … also, a greater risk of cyberattacks.
The manufacturing plants of sensitive products such as chemicals and fuel face intense obstacles in implementing smart technologies due to the magnitude of danger associated with these products and the catastrophe that could result from cyber tampering in these facilities. Cybercriminals could wreak havoc on a country’s infrastructure if they cracked the security codes of these industries that produced flammable elements that could cause maximum damage and extraordinary costs. Despite remarkable technological advancements, there is still a lack of sufficient talent to safely manage IT resources and adequately support the transformation of industrial systems. There is also a lack of cybersecurity talent to manage big data, which is critical for many industries’ safe transformation. A need exists for interdisciplinary skills and subject matter domain knowledge that is limited in the technology job marketplace.
Cybersecurity Maintenance
System security maintenance is crucial as a preventive measure and as a defense strategy in potential cyberattacks. In a large-scale industrial capacity, cybersecurity managers must hire a well-qualified team of cyber professionals who can administrate technical and sensitive systems to maintain a high level of security. Dealing with large-scale industrial systems requires experienced cybersecurity experts to handle complex designed processes. A poorly staffed cybersecurity team with an underdeveloped security maintenance system cannot secure any type of process in this evolving process of digital competencies. The longevity of industrial systems requires continuous physical and cybersecurity maintenance.
Maintenance procedures should be implemented and executed by appropriate cybersecurity personnel. Cybersecurity counterattack strategies are necessary to prevent incidents of data compromise. Preventive strategies for maintaining account login credentials for authorized personnel should be reviewed and changed periodically to avoid cyber watching systems.
Cybersecurity systems for manufacturing equipment and machines should require a supervisor to sign off on facility access daily. Cybersecurity components that maintain tight security systems are less vulnerable to cyber invaders. The lead cybersecurity manager should implement a security log system that accounts for robust testing procedures, device integrity scanning, and authentication of firewalls, as well as routers that provide network connectivity. Quarterly audits should be done that review individually technological systems to ensure that each system operates within its optimized requirements. Routine evaluations should be performed as well as security checks to ensure that security policies are maintained and enforced. Systems should be designed to detect potential weaknesses in current security systems and procedures and make recommendations that can be used to improve future processes.
The Review of Biometric Technology
Biometric technology concerns the use of individuals’ unique physiological and behavioral characteristics for identification and cybersecurity functions. Biometric technology utilizes the unique features of individuals, such as fingerprints, irises, palm prints, retinas, and voice tones, to develop high-quality authentication. In addition, biometrics can further be described as the process of recording, measuring, and analyzing the function of human physiological features.
The pervasive and frequent breaches of private and public data systems have generated interest in biometric authentication as a safe tool for cybersecurity surveillance. Biometric technological tools help identify fraud, solve crimes, and create reliable security systems. Due to the efficacy of biometric authentication, it has been widely used by many high-profile institutions such as military intelligence and national security agencies. The biometric form is part of a broader technique that incorporates identification with other ISR methods to identify the track or profile of targeted individuals. Biometric surveillance can disclose personal information that can be used to identify individuals and expose their activities that are malicious and destructive. 
Public CCTV biometric systems can easily create personal information about travel, employment, social, and cultural habits. Advanced iris scans, ECG, and X-ray biometric systems can provide a great deal of information about an individual’s health and lifestyle. By using cutting-edge technology such as social websites and engaging in online interactions, users share a vast amount of personal information with others. Information transmitted online could be useful to others without the providers’ knowledge.
Stolen data can be used differently, such as identity theft or fraud, or sold to spammers, possibly leading to disruptions or financial costs. Laws enacted to persecute cyberdata invaders are inadequate to provide legal remedies for the customer in the case of a breach. Instead, these laws focus on disclosure and allow for civil action if an organization fails to disclose a breach that led to customer injuries.
Biometric technology creates waves across systems; for instance, biometric technology is used in medico-chemical technology, such as magnetic resonance imaging and electrocardiogram machines. In addition, biometrics is used to enhance personal fitness; thus, many devices, such as Apple Watch and Fitbit, have embedded biometric technology in their applications. Watches and cellular devices can count human steps and measure calories burned. Biometric technology is versatile and can be applied in many facets of human experiences besides authentication.
Identity theft has become lucrative because of modern payment systems and the ability to trade stolen information on the dark web. The exchange of goods and services on credit has created opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit others, as this process involves a tremendous amount of data. Data security is deeply rooted in information systems management, which should be managed with ethical and legal principles. With the permission of smart devices to access companies’ networks, cybersecurity tools need to be strategic, comprehensive, and have an established safety record. Indeed, the human element is paramount in cybersecurity because systems do not monitor themselves. Systems are inanimate and require human intervention.
Many companies in the retail and wholesale chain have permitted access to enterprise services with smart devices to improve work efficiency for their employees. However, some smart devices have weak resistance to external cyberattacks. For example, a smart device stolen or lost can allow customer data to be compromised if they are not equipped with disk encryption to prevent access to sensitive data. Coding techniques and deniable encryption should be installed to hide sensitive data on a desk during communication with other devices to protect the users’ sensitive data and secure transmission. MobiMimosa is a security feature developed to automatically protect sensitive apps and data when a mobile device is targeted and attacked.
ATMs have become a prime source of data collection by cybercriminals due to the extensive use of ATMs for money withdrawals, cash transfers, and bill payments. The utilization of multibiometric mechanisms is essential for enhancing ATM security, effective banking, and reducing criminal activities on ATM machines. Identity thieves have been hiding data scanners in ATMs that scanned customers’ information into the thief network. The thief then uses the information collected to illegally access the customer’s account.
Privacy has always been a treasured right that individuals are reluctant to share. The emergence of big data and cloud computing has caused much of the privacy that we hold dear to diminish. Biometrics cannot protect most of the private information that has already been circulating on the World Wide Web. Fingerprints and facial recognition systems can be tampered with using synthetic materials and acoustic noises that interfere with voice tone characteristics. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately measure the effectiveness of biometrics in some online interactions and data transmissions. However, the error rate could be decreased using a multimodal biometric approach by combining fingerprint and iris techniques.
Multibiometrics combines two or more biometric features to create a formidable security system. Multibiometrics is used to increase protection and boost the reliability of biometric authentication systems. In addition, multimodal biometrics may help to decrease data distortion where the quality of one biometric sample is undesirable; hence, the other biometric characteristics are used to support the mechanism.
Protecting privacy rights has been challenging for many years, as many systems seek to undermine and invade individual rights to privacy. Hackers have found a way to invade personal privacy through smart devices such as ATMs, cellular phones, biometric patterns, fingerprints, and facial recognition images. Modern society has seen a deterioration of principles that seek to redefine personal privacy rights. Government systems and privacy advocacy groups are working together to create legislation protecting privacy rights and preserving sensitive personal data from wanton abuse. 
Internet Revolution and Biometric Technology
The World Wide Web has revolutionized how organizations expand their market product offerings and make it possible to reach new markets in the global marketplace with relative ease. More than 50% of all businesses perform some functions on the internet. Within the ambit of the supply chain, product flow ranges from designing, manufacturing, purchasing, and distribution to the final consumer. With the advancement of information, technology drives supply chain activities into an interlinked and automated process to achieve optimal performance.
Advanced society demands businesses operate on fast, reliable, and secure online platforms while conducting transactions. One of the major challenges organizations face is the ongoing cyberattack threat. As mentioned, cybersecurity remains the greatest threat to the supply chain and online transactions. As information flows through the World Wide Web to increase productivity, so do hackers’ strategies to exploit errors and weaknesses in the system. Biometrics may be able to provide some technical assurances.
The use of biometrics is an innovative method of measurement for security within supply chain systems. Secure databases use logins, passwords, and PINs, whereas biometrics use fingerprints and biological features for authentication.
Biometric technology systems can identify a particular person based on unique biological features or patterns such as DNA, voice tones, irises, and retinas, among other features. Biometric programs can be used in place of traditional security systems to protect computer networks and login credentials. Safety can be managed by governmental interventions and cybersecurity technicians who have the task of monitoring electronic systems as they relate to transportation, medical documentation, and financial records. Physical biometrics has more advantages due to its high levels of accuracy in measuring authentication, but it is more costly to implement and manage.
Although biometric data systems have proven reliable for cybersecurity, it should be understood that biometrics has disadvantages too. One of the disadvantages is storage. It is difficult to store and protect biometric data securely from forgery and interception. In addition, hacking can occur if users are careless. Potential weak points in biometrics are as follows. (1) Exposure of biometric images. (2) Attacks through the retransmission of unsecured information systems. (3) Hackers’ interception systems may infiltrate model databases and (4) Manipulation of images through reverse engineering.
There are ethical issues surrounding using biometrics in organizations as they relate to employees’ privacy. The loss of personal privacy due to the introduction of biometrics in organizations is worrisome, as biometrics is required for employment and payroll. Furthermore, biometric intrusions may threaten the freedom and autonomy of employees. Thus, legal concerns need to be addressed regarding the pervasive use of biometric systems in the workplace. Questions that are swirling about are (1) How much of employees’ privacy is being compromised? (2) How does biometric information affect employees within the legal context of their work? (3) Who has access to employees’ sensitive information? And (4) What are the risks of data breaches?
One of the main reasons for biometric data systems within employment and supply chain is data protection. Securing protected areas of vital importance is a unique requirement of cybersecurity management teams. Information assets must be protected at all times and all costs. Specific information can only be accessed by authorized personnel to maintain strict confidentiality. Biometrics provides more information than just authentication. Using biometrics as an access method may also expose the user’s health and other sensitive information.
In recent times, organizations have preferred biometrics because it provides comprehensive solutions that resist cybercriminals. Biometrics has proven to be an effective and secure method of cybersecurity protection because of its versatile and unique attributes. Biometric security is enhanced when cybertechnologists are proactive in their efforts to ensure that security apparatuses, systems, and protocols are fully employed to detect intrusions in computer networks and databases. Cybersecurity management teams should not rely solely on biometrics as the line of defense against cyberattackers. General security maintenance should be an active part of security administration.
Biometrics and Smart Devices
Biometric technology is used as touch identification systems on a cellular phone, door locks, and tablets to unlock and provide access to the users. This form of access has become popular over the past decade. Today, fingerprint recognition has been extensively used in various applications to provide easy and unique access without keys and other access mechanisms.
Using mobile devices without proper protection could expose users’ personal information to cyber invaders. The constant collection, usage, and sharing of personal information online have provoked many discussions on big data safety. The ease of accessing the private information of others has been made possible through the interconnection and interaction of multiple systems and organizations. Modern technology advancements have made inroads into individuals’ privacy and have created room for personal data compromises.
Biometric authentication can provide solid protection for users of mobile devices. That is one of the reasons why biometric authentications have become one of the preferred authentication methods. Protecting one’s personal information is imperative. In many cases, finding and prosecuting offenders on the World Wide Web is difficult. Lawmakers are struggling with how to provide adequate legal privacy protection for an open-source system that contains diverse unknown elements.
Personal Privacy and Advertisers
Online advertisers can deliver personalized advertisements to individuals based on their online activities, which reveal their interests and preferences. Since users have no contact with these advertisers, it led many users to think that their privacy was being invaded by sources supplying their personal detail information to advertisers. Privacy invaders have disguised their actions by providing benefits, such as gift cards and discounts, to lower users’ concerns about their privacy invasion. Users should be aware of advertisers’ schemes and resist the urge to grab a few dollars in exchange for their privacy.
In general, users like the freedom of the cyberworld, but many are unaware of the risks involved in the sharing and interactions process. Hence, the biometric system helps unsuspecting users to maintain maximum privacy and minimize invasions. Though biometric usage may not eliminate the invasion of privacy on social media, where a vast amount of sharing occurs, it will undoubtedly provide some levels of protection. Social networks’ likes indication may be classified as one of the most effective ways to automatically predict and analyze sensitive personal behaviors of users concerning product offerings. Likes on social media indicate to advertisers the potential interest of users.
Advertisers are looking for users who have specific preferences to target. The like system on social media is a means to capture users’ preferences as marketable opportunities. Social networks have the potential to create readymade markets for advertisers by showing the advertisers the users’ lifestyles.
Biometric Statistics
The Ping Identity study in 2020 indicated that 92% of businesses found biometric authentication effective in securing locally managed identity data, and 86% stated that biometrics is effective in protecting data held in a public cloud storage system. In addition, a Spiceworks study conducted in 2020 indicated that 62% of businesses are using biometric authentication, and another 24% intend to implement biometric authentication over the next two years.
Despite privacy concerns, biometric technology is advancing rapidly across business industries. Many users seem to place more emphasis on security than privacy. While the biometric technology process is refined, the business sectors are already taking advantage of the new technological trend. Users’ tolerance in the developmental stages is critical to developers who continue to explore the depth of the biometric security system. It is too early to say how far biometric technology will advance. However, biometric identification will be significant in data cybersecurity activities.
What makes biometrics extremely harmful is the same factor that makes it beneficial: it is unique to you and is reasonably irreversible. Biometrics uses your own body to recognize you, making it very secure and easy. Like keys, cards, fobs, or passwords, the biometric code is still with you, and you don’t have to think about losing or lacking it. The disadvantage is that you would never be allowed to change your biometric code. If anyone has your password, you can just change it. But if anyone uploads your image to a facial recognition site, you can’t really change your face.
Additional studies on biometric technology in 2018 revealed that 2,000 adult internet users and 44% of voters regarded biometric programs unfavorably compared to 27% who perceived them favorably. Yet, another poll done in 2018 with more than 3,000 people indicated that nearly 45% of participants did not agree that the government would limit the usage of biometric devices, compared to 26% who think that the government will eventually limit biometric usage. Travelers who have been using biometric devices to enter and depart a country nationwide have provided a favorable rating of 8.36 out of 10, as shown in a study released in February 2019 by SITA and the Air Transport World industry publication.
Limitations
As biometric technology continues to flourish, this technology offers considerable advantages and some limitations that need to be considered. Biometric technology captures data by using people’s features like fingerprints, palm prints, hand vein patterns, irises, retinas, and facial recognition. One of the significant limitations of biometrics is the issue of privacy. The breach of confidentiality has always been a point of concern for many users of biometric technology. Fear exists that personal information can be breached through low-tech methods such as mailboxes and information tracking systems.
Stolen data can be misused in different destructive ways. Therefore, users should protect their data by locking their screen passwords with such mechanisms as PINs and pattern locks that they can quickly memorize for access. However, a pattern lock with a low-security level is insufficient to protect the user’s personal data, especially when there is a harsh theft and smudge attack. Nevertheless, MobiMimosa provides some limited help that users should explore.
MobiMimosa (MM) will automatically protect sensitive data stored in the hidden volume when a user’s device suffers a severe attack and reduces the leakage of sensitive data from flash storage and the file system. Nevertheless, MM will not protect the user when the device appears to be used normally. Although MM provides relatively comprehensive protection, leakage of sensitive data is still possible. Government officials, cybersecurity teams, and researchers are working together to secure cloud backup for better preservation of sensitive data; however, no cybersecurity system is foolproof.
Multimodal biometrics provides layers of security that, if applied diligently, can protect ATM customers from identity thefts in vigorous ways. Multimodal biometrics may be used to overcome the limitations of unimodal biometric systems, such as nonuniversality, the lack of distinction, intraclass variety, and spoofing. Although multimodal biometrics is highly versatile, it has its share of limitations and challenges. Some of the challenges are high operation costs which require more enrollment time. Despite the high levels of security defense provided by biometric technology, it is essential to point out that biometric technology is not perfect. But it provides an increased layer of assurance in the cybersecurity world.
Chapter Summary 
Biometric features are used as authentication in many ways, including electronic devices. Instead of using written passwords, some systems use the unique features of individuals to gain digital access to their devices or gain entry to their premises or restricted domain. The protection motivation theory (PMT) sheds light on how to create an effective protection system. It essentially measures decision-makers’ willingness to implement strategies that could protect users’ online privacy. Biometrics is challenging to forge owing to its peculiarity; thus, biometrics is considered one of the most reliable forms of authentication. Many organizations use this type of authentication to identify and provide access control at their secure facility. Although biometrics is a very effective authentication system, it can burden personal privacy because of its unique demands. Essentially, the biometric system is created to satisfy the needs of the users and the demand for protection. There is a strong need for biometrics to fill the gap of security loopholes. Biometric technology is preferred among many cybersecurity providers because of its added layer of security options. Multiple business functions are operating via the internet, including supply chain management. Biometric technology captures data by using people’s features like fingerprints, palm prints, hand vein patterns, irises, retinas, and facial recognition. One of the major limitations of biometrics is the issue of privacy.
Indeed, there are enormous challenges regarding maintaining online privacy and cybersecurity in light of advanced cyber invaders. Reducing cyber invasions on personal and organizational networks is remarkably urgent. The security of smart devices has not yet reached the satisfaction levels of millions of smart device users. The most used smart devices include laptops, tablets, and cellular phones. It has been discovered that the content on these devices can be accessed by the service providers without the consent of the data owners. For instance, private data such as photos, contacts, and bank details can be compromised if hackers breach the providers’ networks. Government intervention is needed to protect users’ personal data from unauthorized use. Social network organizations should not be allowed to access and trade customers’ private data for their own self-interest without the owners’ knowledge.
Cybersecurity should be the priority of big data custodians. Efforts to increase cybersecurity have been the result of biometric authentication. Introducing biometric technology security systems, which use fingerprint identification and facial recognition, has enhanced cybersecurity enormously. In addition, biometric authentication providers have expanded the process to include multimodal biometric security systems. Biometric authentication is the type of identification that has the agility to protect sensitive information by only allowing specific people to gain access to private and confidential information.
Facial recognition is a common biometrics category commonly used in cellular technology. For example, the Apple Corporation uses facial recognition technology in some iPhone models. Two known to use this type of technology are the iPhone XS/XR and the iPhone 11 models. In many cases, the eyes are integral to facial recognition features.
Multiple aspects of biometrics could significantly lower the chances of cyberhackers’ success. Biometrics is known for its high-level security due to its unique attributes; nevertheless, it has a fundamental flaw within some security measures. One of the challenges that biometric providers face with the technology is fingerprint authentication. Primarily, fingerprint-based biometric authentication cannot be fixed once compromised because there is only one set of unique features on a fingerprint. Despite the obvious weak point of biometric security, it is considered secure and safer than using a PIN code or long password and has the potential to double the protection of sensitive data.
Passwords and PIN codes are relatively safe. However, biometrics is considered a more secure method to increase the security of users’ sensitive data. Advanced biometrics such as facial recognition is more difficult to breach than PIN codes and letter-number passwords. Further, biometric authentication is always accessible and requires no user memorization.
Advanced technology has created a place for biometric engineering. Thus, biometrics has become prevalent and preferred among more online users than the traditional password system. Cybersecurity experts reiterated that biometric authentication is less susceptible to invasions of privacy and offers the security assurance that online users need. The use of biometrics is one of the means used to vet new workers’ backgrounds. In addition, biometrics is used for logging the time employees enter and exit their place of employment due to the exploitation of the traditional record-keeping system.

CHAPTER SIX
Loss of Critical Operating Data, Restoration, and Cybersecurity Risk
Introduction
As stated previously in chapter three, cybersecurity is defined as the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to systems’ hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. Cyberattacks typically involve accessing, changing, or disrupting sensitive information to extract money from users’ accounts and interrupt normal business processes.
In today’s marketing trend, many companies have increased their emphasis on customer service. The strategy to focus on customer service is designed to create a sustainable new customers’ experience that is intended to increase customer shares. Hence, customer relations management is extremely important to a company as the company focuses on creating brand differentiation and trends toward competitive advantages in the industry. The loss of critical operating data could compromise a company’s efforts to attain its goal.
Businesses have come to rely on technology to increase productivity to compete effectively in the global marketplace. However, this reliance on technology risks losing critical operating data through hackers’ activities. Whereas technology increases efficiency in many areas of business product offerings, the element of cybersecurity risk is present and can interfere with critical operating data. Thus, it is incumbent on the cybersecurity management team to invest in efficient cyber protection systems, establish strong security measures, and enforce operational protocols to prevent the loss of confidential information.
Romanosky & Sasha (2016) reported that the estimated total costs from cyber events are approximately $8.5 billion annually. Cyber incidents cost firms 0.4% of their annual revenues, much lower than retail shrinkage of 1.3%. Online fraud is 0.9%, and overall rates of corruption of financial misstatements and billing fraud are 5%. Therefore, the possibility of data loss is significant.
Throughout this chapter, we will look deeper into some of the challenges businesses face in protecting their operation’s data. First, we will examine in-depth the background of operations systems and the cybersecurity risks involved. Next, this chapter will elaborate on cybercrime’s problems and the various cyberthreats that cybersecurity personnel must contend with. Also, we will elaborate on the dangers of operating risks and ways to prevent cybercrimes from exploiting businesses. Finally, the theories and limitations associated with this chapter will elaborate on the strategies that could reduce the loss of critical data and the hurdles we face to counteract cybercrimes.
For a business to run effectively, each has an operations department that helps produce products or services for the well-being of society. Any efficient production of goods and services requires an operations strategy. The operations systems’ concepts, tools, and techniques are necessary to help run everything smoothly.
The operations process helps create value by transforming goods and services into meaningful customer experiences. Critical organizational functions such as marketing, budgeting, production, and financial accounting must be established to create and produce the most value for investors. In addition, all firms engage in online transactions, which result in collecting and disseminating data for productive activities. By collecting and analyzing operations’ data, firms understand the cost of production and profit trends, thus, the information to lower prices or make strategic decisions.
Business enterprises and individuals value their privacy and want personal and private information protection. However, advancement in information technology threatens the rights of personal privacy, especially regarding personal data. The access to personal data shift occurred within the second half of the twentieth century when the use of social network platforms became pervasive. In addition, the rise of e-commerce requires more online interactions that result in data sharing, which increases the operations’ data exposure levels. The twenty-first century is the century of big data and advanced information in technology; hence, the birth of giant technology companies that amass great volumes of data, exposing online users to data breaches.
Companies gather data for efficient organizational processes. Therefore, collecting data on their customers is primarily for strategic purposes. Small businesses are unique and have particular ways of collecting information for sales strategies. Data collection includes planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling. Thus, collecting employee data allows organizations to correctly place everyone into a position that best serves the task. Data collection provides insights into how to arrange proper training that may help all the firm employees to work more efficiently. Employee data collection helps human resources provide valuable tools necessary to get tasks done efficiently. Also, data collection helps management establish incentives for workers to encourage motivation. Data loss may result in the miscalculation of strategies, resulting in inefficiency.
Data loss may occur in many ways. (1) Data loss may occur when data is accidentally erased. (2) Data may be corrupted. (3) Viruses might physically damage or format an operating system. (4) Software errors might occur. Losing files and documents often have a lasting impact on a company’s production and financial standing. In addition, data loss can compromise company secrets and give the competition unfair advantages.
Modern information technology is largely responsible for the deterioration of personal privacy. Indeed, the most significant influence on privacy reduction is the accessibility of private information brought about by online activities. Also, social network platforms are heavily invested in changing privacy definitions to facilitate their economic gains. Many social network providers have created forums that allow users to share information and advertisers to gather information about users. Thus, many users are unaware of how much of their private information is in the public domain.
Problems and Challenges of Data Loss
The loss of data could result in high economic costs for an organization. There are concerns that a cyberattack on critical infrastructures such as dams, trains, electrical grids, pipeline pumps, transportation, and communications networks, as well as on the financial services industry, could cause significant physical and economic damage to any country affected. The unauthorized disclosure of private and confidential information could serve to access restricted areas of vast importance, invade privacy, and destroy critical operating components.
The loss of critical operating systems includes the theft of computer components, laptops, desktops, hardware, software, and network apparatuses. Furthermore, unauthorized access, data breaches, and the encryption of the information render it unusable to the owner is a form of data loss. Any successful effort that allows cyber invaders to obtain private and sensitive information that impacts the owner in any way is considered data loss. Cybersecurity experts have reiterated that online users should be careful with their online activities because cybercriminals could use unauthorized access of their personal information to commit identity theft, including tax, medical, and financial frauds. To function effectively today, the utilization of online technology is a central component. However, using online resources, users risk being victimized by cyber invaders.
Let us consider how the loss of critical data could affect users. For instance, think about a person on Medtronic implantable cardiac device programmed to rely on information from the patient to a cardiologist in real time. What could happen if the information got intercepted, suspended, or altered? Of course, the result could be grave. Also, consider toys with cameras, speakers, GPS, microphones, and Wi-Fi capabilities. What could happen if they were hacked and exploited? Organizations that lost data to cybercriminals have suffered enormous losses in financial resources and business reputations.
Practically any piece of data that an unauthorized person can access is considered data loss. Legislation by the government has created remedies for privacy invasions. Invasion of privacy is a tort based on common law that allows an aggrieved party to bring a lawsuit against an individual who unlawfully intrudes on the individual’s personal data. Unfortunately, online users are inordinately losing data. Cyber invaders are using schemes like skimming; that is, the act of copying information from a credit card via a handheld tool the size of a lighter. Also, hackers have devices that fit over a gas station pump and ATMs that automatically copy users’ credit and debit card information into the hackers’ network.
Research revealed that the private sector owns approximately 85% of the critical infrastructure in the US. The challenge is whether private businesses are willing to invest in cybersecurity to provide adequate protection to these facilities. The investigation into the frequency of data breaches revealed that some private sector organizations did not budget enough for cybersecurity, which led to inadequate security systems that cybercriminals could easily breach. The loss of data could take tremendous resources to recover or be reconstructed. Cybersecurity researchers reported that a company that experiences a computer outage lasting more than 10 days would never fully recover financially. Additionally, 50% of companies that suffered from a network of significant magnitude will be closed within five years.
The Purpose of Reviewing Loss and Restoration
The purpose of this subject matter is to bring awareness to the increased challenges businesses face with the loss of critical operating data. Also, the burden of the cost of restoration has undermined the success of many organizations and forced them into early closure. There are many reasons why a company’s operating data is compromised. These reasons include human error, malware, hard drive damage, and natural disasters.
The damages that a company could sustain from the loss of critical information could cripple the company’s total operations. There have been instances where major companies such as Target Corporation in the USA have dealt with major data breaches, which tarnished the company’s reputation. Once an organization loses its data and the data of its customers, customers no longer trust the organization with their private information. In the case of Target Corporation, for many years after the breach, customers used cash instead of their bank or credit cards. As a result, they spent less using money, and Target’s revenues reduced drastically. Companies that take increased preventative measures to avoid data loss will take specific steps such as establishing stringent data protection policies, documenting risks, acquiring proven firewalls, creating a communication plan, and engaging in frequent updates. Indeed, they will engage in best practices in terms of cybersecurity.
​The emergence of e-transactions has added a new responsibility to businesses both large and small. The new duty is to manage large volumes of electronic information for customers and stakeholders. Given the nature of online transactions, organizations must establish restoration strategies as a provision for data loss. Five data restoration strategies examined are: (1) Establish an internal​ recovery strategy by having a team of technicians and software ready for action. (2) Inspect vendors’ cybersecurity systems for vulnerability to support recovery strategies without compromising your data. (3) Anticipate natural disasters and develop an IT disaster recovery plan that minimizes data loss in a crisis. (4) Always have an off-site data backup plan; external backup will speed up data recovery. (5) The options for data backup must be established as a standard practice.
Developing an IT disaster recovery plan to protect information from being lost is a fundamental contingency plan that will enhance data protection and sustain business continuity. Building up an information reinforcement system starts with distinguishing what information to protect, designing a protection strategy, choosing the appropriate storage method, and programming reinforcement methodology. The information recovery strategy should meet the approval of the cybersecurity resource team; otherwise, the plan is worthless.
Also, a data backup strategy should be designed to distinguish information on organizations’ networks, servers, workstations, and mobile devices and provide a robust backup support system. The system should be able to sense and copy records and data that may be in danger. The system should be designed to back up data and secure them routinely. The system should have remote capabilities to the organization’s network. Backup information on the server should be able to be used seamlessly in a disaster.
Theory Approach and Application of Data Loss
Organizations are responsible for protecting their data loss, corruption, distortion, and theft. Thus, total quality management (TQM) should be established as their modus operandi. TQM may be essential in preventing data loss if the organization sets standard policies and enforces protocol adherence. The quality of data protection will determine the safety of the data. The quality of service instituted to prevent hackers from stealing critical information must undergo vigorous tests and inspections to ensure that it can withstand the schemes of the attackers. It must be noted that the failure of organizations’ leaders to install and maintain high-quality cybersecurity systems to protect their organizations’ data could result in bankruptcy. Data loss could be exploited to the detriment of the organization. Therefore, regarding data management, TQM is an essential component of businesses regardless of their operations. Data loss could harm the supply chain and result in delays and economic damage.
Every organizational leader should establish rules and guidelines that meet TQM standards to ensure that the safety of the large volume of data that the organization manages due to online transactions is safe. To meet TQM standards, organizations should select the best human resources with the highest possible technological skills and knowledge to create software or a firewall that can counteract cyber invaders’ tactics and protect the critical information database.
Data Restoration Reviewed
The restoration of data is complex because the backup system is often inadequate. Further, backed data may need to be sorted and reinstalled to the company’s network. Critical operating information may be lost or omitted in the process. The restoration of data on a national level is complicated, given the enormous volume and the levels of intelligence. The private sector could also find data restoration difficult due to the loss of control and the costs associated with the restoration process. US businesses use an estimated 76.2 million PCs to support the production of goods and services. Thus, this equipment generates billions of data per day. Laptops are used as a business tool more widely than ever before. The estimated record is 15.2 million units, or about 20% of all business PCs. The number of desktops used by individuals and organizations is approximately 61.0 million. All this equipment is susceptible to data loss and restoration.
Research revealed that data loss could take hundreds of hours over several weeks to be recovered and reconstructed, which could prove costly for the victim. The prolonged effort to restore data could result in the demise of a company. Indeed, it is difficult to precisely measure the intrinsic value of data due to the variation and levels of importance; however, literary scholars have suggested that the value of 100 megabytes of data is valued at approximately $1 million, which could translate to roughly $10,000 for each MB of lost data. These approximations did not consider nonmonetary losses that are associated with the loss of trust from customers and the decline of business reputations. Device connectivity should be carefully monitored to prevent intrusions.
It is common knowledge that Bluetooth technology can be used to connect to other networks if the password is known or the network is unsecured. Hackers can use these devices to communicate and form a Bluetooth network capable of interfering with an individual’s data unknown to them. Some experts alluded that the communication technology that allows Bluetooth network connectivity is known as a piconet. This technology can access smart business and household devices. Wi-Fi technology is largely responsible for Bluetooth access’s effectiveness, which is a serious threat to private data safety.
Data Value Reviewed
The importance of data protection is considered a top priority of financial institutions as hackers are getting away with millions of dollars that cannot be tracked. Banking information is critical as any weak point may expose the organization to insurmountable losses. Thus, banks must protect their customers’ accounts at all costs. Hackers are individuals with tremendous skills in technology. Once they find an access point, they could invade any computer network and make off with valuable, sensitive data. Therefore, companies and individuals should take all necessary steps to improve cybersecurity and protect their information assets.
Target Corporation had a higher stock price than Walmart before Target suffered one of the largest data breaches in modern history. The data breach caused the price of Target’s stock to fall, resulting in investors losing economic value. According to business reports, Target’s shareholders lost between $2 to $6 billion in
