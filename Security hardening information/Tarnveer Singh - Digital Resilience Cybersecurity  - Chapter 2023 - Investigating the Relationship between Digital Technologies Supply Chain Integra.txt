Supply Chain Management
Supply chain management (SCM) has emerged as a critical component for businesses across industries, playing a pivotal role in ensuring operational efficiency, cost optimisation, and customer satisfaction. As professionals in the field, we understand the intricate web of interconnected activities that span from raw material sourcing to final product delivery. Effective supply chain management is the backbone of any successful enterprise, enabling seamless coordination between various stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers.
Iftikhar et al. (2024) contend that strengthening supply chain resilience particularly through use of cyber resilience and emerging technologies can help in protecting supply chains from extremely disruptive shocks.1
In today’s globalised and highly competitive business landscape, the ability to manage supply chains effectively can be a game-changer. Companies that excel in this area can gain a significant competitive advantage, reducing operational costs, minimising waste, and delivering products and services to customers promptly.2 Conversely, organisations that fail to prioritise SCM often face challenges such as inventory imbalances, production delays, and customer dissatisfaction, ultimately hampering their growth and profitability.
Wang et al. (2022) purport it is vital that firms use digital technologies to monitor and control their supply chains and help build resilience.3
Alvarenga et al. (2023) argue building supply chain resilience and robustness is vital and the solution is using SCM in combination with building resilience through effective use of technology.4
As experienced CISO and Finance leaders, we recognise the importance of continuously improving and adapting to the ever-changing market dynamics. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, embracing sustainable practices, and fostering collaborations with key partners, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation within their supply chains.5
Effective SCM is crucial for businesses to thrive in today’s competitive landscape. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from procurement and logistics to inventory management and customer service. By optimising these processes, organisations can achieve significant benefits that directly impact their bottom line and customer satisfaction levels. Cost optimisation is important. Streamlining supply chain operations can lead to substantial cost savings through reduced inventory levels, minimised waste, and improved operational efficiencies. Effective supply chain management helps identify and eliminate bottlenecks, enabling businesses to operate more cost-effectively. Enhanced customer satisfaction can be valuable. By ensuring timely delivery of products and services, SCM plays a pivotal role in meeting customer expectations. Efficient supply chains enable businesses to respond quickly to changing market demands, adapt to fluctuations in consumer preferences, and provide superior customer service. In today’s fast-paced business environment, agility and responsiveness are essential for success. Effective SCM allows organisations to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions, respond to disruptions, and capitalise on emerging opportunities, giving them a competitive edge over their rivals. Risk mitigation is a major benefit. Supply chains are vulnerable to various risks, including natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and supplier disruptions. Robust SCM strategies help identify potential risks and implement contingency plans to mitigate their impact, ensuring business continuity and minimising financial losses.
By recognising the importance of effective SCM, businesses can unlock significant value, drive growth, and foster long-term sustainability within their operations.
SCM encompasses a multitude of interconnected components that work in harmony to ensure the efficient flow of goods, services, and information from the point of origin to the final consumer. As a supply chain professional, I understand the significance of each component and its role in contributing to the overall success of the supply chain. Procurement and sourcing is vital. This component involves identifying and selecting reliable suppliers, negotiating favourable terms, and ensuring the timely and cost-effective acquisition of raw materials, components, and services. Effective procurement strategies can significantly impact the overall supply chain performance. Production and manufacturing focuses on the transformation of raw materials into finished goods through various manufacturing processes. It involves capacity planning, quality control, and the implementation of lean manufacturing principles to optimise production efficiency and minimise waste. Inventory management is essential as maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for ensuring smooth operations and meeting customer demand. This component involves forecasting demand, managing stock levels, and implementing inventory control strategies such as just-in-time (JIT) or vendor-managed inventory (VMI) systems. Logistics and transportation as a process encompasses the physical movement of goods from suppliers to manufacturing facilities, distribution centres, and ultimately to the end customers. It involves selecting appropriate transportation modes, optimising routes, and managing warehousing and distribution operations. Information and technology is vital as SCM heavily relies on the effective flow of information and data across all components. This component involves implementing robust information systems, integrating technology solutions, and leveraging data analytics to drive informed decision-making and continuous improvement. Effective SCM requires close collaboration and integration among all stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and customers. This component involves fostering strong partnerships, sharing information, and aligning processes to achieve common goals.
By understanding and effectively managing these key components, businesses can streamline their supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and ultimately drive profitability and customer satisfaction.
Implementing effective SCM practices can yield numerous benefits for businesses, positively impacting various aspects of their operations. As a supply chain professional, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of well-executed supply chain strategies. Benefits are considerable. Operational efficiency can be achieved. By optimising processes, reducing waste, and eliminating redundancies, SCM enhances overall operational efficiency. This results in faster turnaround times, increased productivity, and better resource utilisation, ultimately leading to cost savings and improved profitability. Customer satisfaction can be enhanced. Efficient SCM ensures timely delivery of products and services, meeting or exceeding customer expectations. It also enables businesses to respond quickly to changing customer demands, fostering stronger relationships and brand loyalty. Competitiveness can be increased as companies with robust SCM practices can gain a competitive edge by offering shorter lead times, better product availability, and superior customer service. This can translate into increased market share and a stronger position in the industry. Inventory costs can be reduced. Effective inventory management strategies, such as JIT or VMI, help minimise excess inventory levels, freeing up working capital and reducing associated costs like storage, handling, and obsolescence. Risk management can be improved. SCM involves identifying and mitigating potential risks, such as supplier disruptions, transportation delays, or natural disasters. By implementing contingency plans and diversifying supply sources, businesses can enhance their resilience and ensure business continuity. Visibility and transparency can be enhanced. Advanced SCM systems and technologies provide real-time visibility into the flow of goods, materials, and information across the entire supply chain. This transparency enables better decision-making, proactive problem-solving, and continuous improvement. Modern SCM practices emphasise sustainability and ethical sourcing, enabling businesses to minimise their environmental impact, promote social responsibility, and enhance their reputation among conscious consumers.
By embracing SCM best practices, businesses can unlock significant value, drive growth, and achieve a competitive advantage in their respective markets.
Within procurement, consideration of SCM principles as part of the procurement process can help assess and mitigate supply chain-related project risks, which is particularly important since challenges related to the supply chain are not expected to ease in the short term. Overall, SCM can help achieve business objectives. SCM makes the supply chain more resilient (e.g., creating a supply chain that can withstand shocks and disruptions). It helps with responding to supply chain disruptions (e.g., caused by COVID-19, natural catastrophes, delays at customs) and market distortions (e.g., a constrained global supply). SCM helps with addressing transportation challenges and delays (e.g., posed by more complex logistics arrangements and higher costs). It assists with managing increased delivery lead times (e.g., due to supply shortages or capacity limitations). SCM promotes environmental and social sustainability through the supply chain (e.g., by emphasising adequate labour standards, including employment terms and conditions, and occupational health and safety, and the importance of managing environmental impacts). It helps with monitoring project performance and completion according to specifications (e.g., on-time and on-budget performance, which can also be determined by the supply chain).
While the benefits of effective SCM are numerous, implementing and maintaining efficient supply chain practices can present various challenges. As a supply chain professional, I have encountered and navigated through challenges to ensure seamless operations. Globalisation and complexity are among the business challenges. As businesses expand their operations globally, supply chains become increasingly complex, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distribution channels across different countries and regions. Managing these intricate networks and ensuring compliance with diverse regulations and cultural norms can be a daunting task. Companies often depend on a global supply base. An overseas supplier or contractor might be cheaper, produce better quality, or simply be the only source for the needed input or service. However, an overseas supplier or contractor can also heighten the risk associated with the required input due to the physical distance, making it harder to control and monitor the supplier and the associated supply chain. Organisations should therefore aim to identify critical inputs and scrutinise the supplier’s supply chain, particularly the geographic location of higher-tier suppliers or subcontractors and any risks that may be associated with, for instance, different legal systems in other countries, challenges related to border crossings, or reliable infrastructure and transportation. One factor driving globalisation and enabling it to be better managed is information technology (IT). Coordination and interaction across multi-country supply chains can be facilitated with IT systems, enhancing visibility and transparency.
Supply and demand volatility is a serious challenge. Fluctuations in customer demand, market trends, and economic conditions can create imbalances in supply and demand, leading to excess inventory or stock shortages. Accurately forecasting demand and adapting supply chains to these fluctuations are constant challenges. Supply shortages can cause catastrophic failures. If a product or component does not arrive when needed, this may delay or even prevent the completion of an entire project. Supply shortages are often the reason for this delay, which can be triggered by challenges experienced by higher-tier suppliers or contractors or by unexpectedly high demand. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to many supply shortages. Increasingly longer and more complex supply chains, coupled with companies’ attempts to be “lean” and efficient (i.e., carrying as little inventory as possible), have been increasing the risk of supply shortages. Organisations should therefore assess the supplier’s supply chain to look for choke points that may lead to supply shortages, as well as the availability of inventory buffers to alleviate any shortages.
Technology integration and data management pose serious problems. Supply chain management relies heavily on technology and data integration across various systems and stakeholders. Ensuring seamless integration, data accuracy, and real-time visibility can be challenging, especially when dealing with legacy systems or disparate data sources.
Risk mitigation and disruption management in the supply chain are complex and difficult to resolve. Supply chains are vulnerable to various risks, such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, cyber threats, and supplier disruptions. Identifying and mitigating these risks, as well as developing contingency plans for business continuity, requires constant vigilance and proactive planning. Geopolitical events and other disruptions can be very damaging. Dispersed, worldwide supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions and other events. Examples include trade sanctions, conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Deliberate management of the supply chain is important to identify, mitigate, and manage such potential vulnerabilities.
Talent and skill gaps exist across the supply chain. As SCM evolves and becomes more complex, there is a growing need for skilled professionals with specialised knowledge and expertise. Attracting, retaining, and developing talent in this field can be a significant challenge for many organisations.
Sustainability and environmental concerns can clash with SCM. Businesses are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices and minimise their environmental impact throughout the supply chain. Balancing sustainability goals with operational efficiency and cost considerations can be a delicate balance.

Supply Chain Risks
Third-party risk management can be a daunting task. Supply chains often involve multiple third-party partners, such as suppliers, logistics providers, and distributors. Managing and mitigating risks associated with these external partners, including compliance, quality, and security concerns, is a critical challenge.
To overcome these challenges, supply chain professionals must continuously adapt, innovate, and leverage best practices, technologies, and collaborative partnerships. By addressing these challenges head-on, businesses can build resilient and efficient supply chains that drive long-term success.
Dubey et al. (2023) argue government must do more to drive organisations to improve their supply chain resilience by enhancing digital adaptability and digital agility.6
Strategies for mitigating third-party risks in supply chain management must be given proper consideration. In today’s interconnected business landscape, supply chains often involve numerous third-party partners, such as suppliers, logistics providers, and distributors. While these partnerships can bring significant benefits, they also introduce potential risks that need to be carefully managed. As a supply chain professional, I understand the importance of implementing effective strategies to mitigate third-party risks and ensure the integrity and resilience of the supply chain.
Comprehensive due diligence and vetting processes are essential. Before onboarding any third-party partner, it is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence assessments. This includes evaluating their financial stability, operational capabilities, compliance with regulations, and adherence to ethical and sustainability standards. A rigorous vetting process can help identify potential risks and ensure alignment with your organisation’s values and requirements.
Robust contracts and service level agreements (SLAs) provide clarity. Clear and comprehensive contracts and SLAs are essential for defining expectations, responsibilities, and accountability with third-party partners. These agreements should outline performance metrics, quality standards, data security measures, and contingency plans for potential disruptions or non-compliance.
Continuous monitoring and performance evaluation are necessary to provide assurance. Regularly monitoring and evaluating the performance of third-party partners is crucial for identifying potential issues or risks before they escalate. This can involve conducting audits, reviewing performance metrics, and maintaining open communication channels to address concerns promptly.
Diversification and contingency planning improve preparedness. Overreliance on a single third-party partner can increase supply chain vulnerability. Diversifying your supplier base, logistics providers, and distribution channels can help mitigate risks and ensure business continuity in case of disruptions. Additionally, developing contingency plans and alternative sourcing strategies can provide a safety net in case of unforeseen events.
Cybersecurity and data protection are important considerations. Supply chains involve the exchange of sensitive information and data with third-party partners. Implementing robust cybersecurity measures, such as encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, is essential to protect against data breaches, cyber threats, and intellectual property theft.
Collaborative partnerships and transparency are necessary in building healthy relationships. Building strong, collaborative partnerships with third-party partners based on trust and transparency can help mitigate risks. Open communication, information sharing, and joint problem-solving can foster a culture of accountability and enable proactive risk management.
Continuous improvement and adaptation are necessary to embed lessons learned. Supply chain risks are dynamic and ever-evolving. Regularly reviewing and updating risk mitigation strategies, incorporating lessons learned, and adapting to changing market conditions and emerging threats are crucial for maintaining supply chain resilience.
By implementing these strategies, businesses can effectively manage third-party risks, build resilient supply chains, and safeguard their operations, reputation, and long-term success.
Best practices for successful SCM provide a litmus test. Achieving success in SCM requires a combination of strategic planning, operational excellence, and continuous improvement. As a supply chain professional, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of implementing best practices and tailoring these to the unique needs of each organisation.
Aligning supply chain strategy with business objectives is necessary to focus business efforts. Effective SCM starts with aligning the supply chain strategy with the overall business objectives and goals. This ensures that supply chain initiatives and investments are aligned with the company’s strategic direction, enabling better resource allocation and decision-making.
Embracing collaboration and partnership helps address mutual problems and provide mutual support. Supply chains involve multiple stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and customers. Fostering collaborative partnerships based on trust, transparency, and shared goals can lead to improved efficiency, innovation, and risk mitigation.
By leveraging technology and data analytics, decision-making can be enhanced. Implementing advanced technologies, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, supply chain management software, and data analytics tools, can provide real-time visibility, optimise processes, and drive data-driven decision-making throughout the supply chain.
Adopt lean and agile principles to improve efficiency. Lean and agile methodologies, such as JIT production, continuous improvement (Kaizen), and value stream mapping, can help eliminate waste, reduce lead times, and increase responsiveness to changing customer demands.
Implement sustainable and ethical practices to enhance your brand. Incorporating sustainability and ethical practices into supply chain operations is not only beneficial for the environment and society but can also enhance brand reputation, attract conscious consumers, and drive long-term value creation.
Invest in talent development and training. SCM requires a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. Investing in talent development, training programmes, and continuous learning opportunities can help build a strong and capable supply chain team.
Measure and continuously improve through learning. Establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly measuring supply chain performance are crucial for identifying areas for improvement. Continuous improvement initiatives, such as process optimisation, risk management, and supplier performance evaluation, can drive ongoing efficiency and effectiveness.
Fostering supply chain resilience is vital. Building resilient supply chains involves identifying potential risks, developing contingency plans, and implementing strategies for risk mitigation and business continuity. This can include diversifying supplier bases, maintaining safety stocks, and investing in supply chain visibility and agility.
By embracing these best practices, organisations can optimise their supply chain operations, enhance competitiveness, and drive long-term success in an ever-changing business landscape.

Technologies and Tools
Technologies and tools for optimising SCM must be considered. In the modern era of globalisation and digital transformation, SCM has evolved to leverage cutting-edge technologies and tools to optimise operations, enhance visibility, and drive efficiency. As a resilience professional, I recognise the importance of embracing these technological advancements to stay ahead of the curve and gain a competitive edge.
ERP systems help with integration. ERP systems provide a centralised platform for managing and integrating various business processes, including supply chain management. These systems offer real-time visibility into inventory levels, order tracking, and financial data, enabling informed decision-making and streamlined operations.
SCM software assists with optimisation. Specialised SCM software solutions are designed to optimise supply chain processes, from procurement and logistics to inventory management and demand forecasting.

Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
Supply chain vulnerabilities can manifest in myriad forms, from natural disasters and geopolitical instabilities to cyber threats and regulatory shifts. These vulnerabilities can strike at any point along the supply chain, rippling through the entire ecosystem and potentially immobilising operations. Recognising and addressing these risks is not merely a matter of business continuity; it is a strategic imperative that can spell the difference between success and failure in an increasingly competitive and uncertain world.
Dubey et al. (2023) argue government must do more to drive organisations to improve their supply chain resilience by enhancing digital adaptability and digital agility.8
Hägele et al. (2023) emphasise the important of supply chain resilience and identifying vulnerabilities because in the intricate tapestry of modern business operations, supply chains form the backbone, weaving together a complex network of interdependencies. However, with complexity comes vulnerability, and the potential for disruptions lurks within the intricate web of processes and relationships that define SCM.9
Alvarenga et al. (2023) argue building supply chain resilience and robustness is vital.10 As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of global commerce, it becomes paramount to unearth these hidden vulnerabilities, empowering organisations to fortify their resilience and safeguard their operational integrity.
We will delve into the depths of supply chain vulnerabilities, shedding light on their impact, identifying common types, and equipping you with the tools and strategies necessary to assess and mitigate these risks. Through real-life case studies and expert insights, I aim to empower you with the knowledge and foresight to navigate the complexities of SCM, ensuring optimal resilience and long-term success.
Supply chain vulnerabilities can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the confines of a single organisation. When supply chains falter, the ripple effects can disrupt operations, erode customer confidence, and ultimately undermine profitability and market position. The impact of these vulnerabilities on businesses can manifest in various ways.
Operational disruptions are costly. Supply chain disruptions can grind production lines to a halt, leading to costly delays, missed deadlines, and unfulfilled customer orders. This can result in lost revenue, strained relationships with clients, and reputational damage.
Financial implications can be severe. Supply chain vulnerabilities can impose significant financial burdens on businesses. From increased costs associated with expedited shipping, alternative sourcing, and inventory management to potential penalties for late deliveries, the financial toll can be substantial.
Reputational harm can damage trust. In today’s interconnected world, supply chain disruptions can quickly become public knowledge, potentially tarnishing a company’s reputation and eroding consumer trust. This can have long-lasting effects on brand equity and market positioning.
Regulatory compliance risks must be taken into consideration. Supply chain vulnerabilities can expose businesses to regulatory non-compliance, potentially leading to hefty fines, legal disputes, and even temporary shutdowns in severe cases.
Competitive disadvantage should also be factored in. While some businesses proactively address supply chain vulnerabilities, those that fail to do so may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, losing market share to more resilient competitors.
Recognising the far-reaching implications of supply chain vulnerabilities is the first step toward building a robust and resilient ecosystem capable of withstanding the inevitable challenges that arise in the dynamic world of global commerce.11
Supply chain vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms, each presenting unique challenges and requiring tailored mitigation strategies. Understanding the common types of vulnerabilities is crucial for developing a comprehensive risk management approach.
Natural disasters are damaging. Extreme weather events, earthquakes, and other natural calamities can disrupt supply chains by damaging infrastructure, impeding transportation routes, and disrupting production facilities.
Geopolitical instabilities can have far-reaching effects causing damage across the world. Political unrest, trade disputes, and economic sanctions can create barriers to cross-border trade, disrupt supply lines, and introduce regulatory complexities.
Cyber threats are highly pervasive. The increasing reliance on digital systems and interconnected networks makes supply chains vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches, and system failures, potentially compromising sensitive information and disrupting operations.
Supplier risks can be unpredictable and cause damage that ripples across entire industries. Overreliance on a single supplier, inadequate supplier vetting processes, or financial instability among key suppliers can create vulnerabilities that ripple through the supply chain.
Transportation and logistics disruptions can cause significant disputes and supply-side shocks. Disruption in transportation networks, port congestion, or labour disputes can delay the movement of goods, leading to stockouts and production bottlenecks.
Regulatory changes can add complexities that can impact two seemingly similar companies in the same sector in different ways. Evolving regulations, trade policies, and compliance requirements can introduce complexities and necessitate operational adjustments, potentially disrupting established supply chain processes.
Quality control issues can erode trust and reputations faster than ever before. Lapses in quality control, counterfeit products, or defective components can compromise product integrity and lead to recalls, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.
Supply and demand volatility can lead to stockpiles or shortages. Sudden shifts in consumer demand, market trends, or supply shortages can strain supply chain capabilities and lead to inventory imbalances or stockouts.
By understanding these common vulnerabilities, organisations can proactively develop risk mitigation strategies and build resilience into their supply chain operations.
Identifying hidden risks in the supply chain is vital. While some supply chain vulnerabilities are readily apparent, others can remain hidden, lurking beneath the surface and posing insidious threats to operational continuity. Identifying these hidden risks requires a proactive and comprehensive approach, leveraging various techniques and tools to uncover potential weaknesses and awareness gaps. Here are some strategies for uncovering hidden supply chain risks.
Supply chain mapping is essential. Develop a comprehensive map of your supply chain, including all tiers of suppliers, transportation routes, and distribution channels. This visual representation can help identify potential bottlenecks, single points of failure, and dependencies that may not be immediately apparent.
Supplier audits and assessments allow for proper scrutiny. Conduct thorough audits and assessments of your suppliers to evaluate their financial stability, operational capabilities, risk management practices, and compliance with industry standards and regulations. This can help identify potential vulnerabilities within your supplier network.
Data analytics and predictive modelling can develop unique insights. Leverage data analytics and predictive modelling techniques to analyse historical data and identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors. This can provide valuable insights into hidden vulnerabilities and enable proactive risk mitigation strategies.
Mayur (2024) argues scenario planning and stress testing are vital and can help identify weaknesses and inform contingency planning.12 Engage in scenario planning exercises and stress test your supply chain against various potential disruptions, such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, or regulatory changes.
Collaboration and information sharing enables better outcomes for everyone. Foster collaboration and information sharing with industry peers, trade associations, and government agencies. This can provide access to valuable intelligence and insights into emerging risks and best practices for risk mitigation.
Employee feedback and whistleblower programmes are helpful. Encourage employee feedback and implement whistleblower programmes to gather insights from those on the front lines of your operations. This can help uncover potential risks or issues that may not be visible from a top-down perspective.
Continuous monitoring and risk assessments accelerate learning. Implement a continuous monitoring and risk assessment process to regularly evaluate your supply chain for emerging vulnerabilities. This proactive approach can help identify risks before they escalate into full-blown disruptions.
By employing these strategies and embracing a culture of continuous improvement, organisations can enhance their ability to identify hidden risks and fortify their supply chain resilience.

Supply Chain Mapping
Supply chain maps enable organisations to pinpoint potential weak spots, which are critical weaknesses in the supply chain that could threaten the project. Recognising these possible supply chain vulnerabilities allows organisations to concentrate their monitoring on the most fragile parts of the supply chain, create supply risk mitigation strategies if those vulnerabilities cause a disruption, and/or address the vulnerability by reinforcing that segment of the supply chain.
Data gathered through supply chain mapping can assist organisations in identifying vulnerabilities. By considering these supply chain characteristics, organisations can gain a clearer understanding of the dependencies and potential choke points and risks.
Organisations should be aware that, in most cases, it is not feasible to obtain complete information on all aspects of the supply chain. However, even limited insights, based on the available information, are better than none.
Supply chain maps are effective in identifying points of vulnerability. Supply chain characteristics can make the supply chain more or less vulnerable to disruptions.
The number of tiers in a supply chain has a considerable impact. The vulnerability of a supply chain increases with the number of tiers, due to the practical inability to control and gain insight into such complex supply chains. While in most cases it is impossible to obtain a complete picture of complex supply chains, organisations can regularly scan newspapers and other media that may provide information on disruptions that could potentially impact the industry and/or the supply chain – for instance, a ship blocking the Suez Canal, COVID-19 lockdowns, trade sanctions, or micro-chip/semiconductor shortages. Advanced technologies and analytics can also be used to obtain such insights.
The criticality of each supply chain tier is crucial. Where a supplier is the only organisation (i.e., a sole supplier) or one of the few organisations that can provide the input, the vulnerability of the supply chain increases. Vulnerability can be reduced by respecifying or redesigning the required input (e.g., via value engineering or value analysis) so that more suppliers are able to provide the component, thereby reducing supply chain vulnerability. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, disrupted almost every supply chain, demonstrating to many organisations the benefits of dual- or multi-sourcing. Vulnerabilities were also discovered in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan, which also highlighted the risks of single-sourcing. For example, several automotive firms were not able to deliver cars in a certain paint colour (Tuxedo Black and Royal Red), since the sole supplier of those colour pigments had been impacted by the tsunami. It is important to learn from these experiences and design the supply chain to reduce risks to avoid further disruptions. In this case, organisations started to dual-source pigments, and, more broadly, design their other supply chains with resilience in mind. Toyota, for instance, credits the lessons learned from the 2011 earthquake with the firm being able to reduce the impact of the semiconductor shortages in
