# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Gregory C. Rasner - Cybersecurity and Third-Party Risk_ Third Party Threat Hunting (2021, Wiley) - libgen.li
Chapter: 8 - covers the Continuous Monitoring (CM) pro-
gram and how it is a crucial security control for vendors for 
the times in between the point-in-time assessments. Building 
a robust CM program means taking a set of tools and internal 
data to engage vendors on potential real threats that they may 
be unaware of and reducing risk collaboratively. Chapter 9, the 
last chapter on the vendor lifecycle, discusses offboarding. Many 
firms overlook this part of the lifecycle, so this chapter covers 
the critical steps and due diligence that must be done to ensure 
there’s no risk to the data or connectivity from a vendor.
Section  2 begins with Chapter  10, which discusses the 
large topic of the cloud. The shared responsibility model is dis-
cussed and how it affects the security controls that your vendor 
is responsible for and what they have outsourced to the Cloud 
Service Provider (CSP). Cybersecurity, offshore vendors, cloud 
and privacy legal language and process is covered in Chapter 11; 
and then Chapter 12 details in depth the possible ways to test and 
perform due diligence on third-party software. Connectivity to a 
vendor is a unique risk that opens a whole organization’s network 
and data to an attacker traversing from the vendor or exploiting 
the hardware they use to connect, and is discussed in Chapter 13.
