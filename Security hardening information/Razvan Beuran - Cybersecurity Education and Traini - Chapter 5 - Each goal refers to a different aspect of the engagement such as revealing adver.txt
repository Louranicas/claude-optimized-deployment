Chapter: 5 - Each goal refers to a different aspect of the engagement, such as revealing adversary operations for Expose (EGO0001), or negatively affecting their operations for Affect (EGO0002).Table 6.5Overview of the goals for the Operate phase in the Engage frameworkNameGoal descriptionExposeReveal the presence of ongoing adversary operationsAffectNegatively impact the adversaries operationsElicitLearn about adversaries tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
Approaches At the second level of each phase in Engage are located the approaches. For example, the Affect (EGO0002) goal includes three approaches, as shown in Table 6.6. Each approach refers to an overall method that can be used to achieve a given goal. For instance, the Disrupt (EAP0005) methodology should be used to reduce the ability of an adversary of conducting their planned attack.Table 6.6Overview of the approaches for the Affect goal in the Engage frameworkNameApproach descriptionPreventStop all or part of the adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intendedDirectEncourage or discourage the adversary from conducting their operation as intendedDisruptImpair an adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intended
Activities At the lowest level in the Engage framework are situated the activities. For example, the Disrupt (EAP0005) approach includes the activities presented in Table 6.7. Each activity represents a concrete technique that can be used to put a given approach into practice, such as Isolation (EAC0020) to prevent the expansion of an engagement beyond the desired limits, or Lures (EAC0005) to elicit a specific response from adversaries.Table 6.7Overview of the activities for the Disrupt approach in the Engage frameworkNameActivity descriptionIsolationConfigure devices, systems, networks, etc. to contain activity and data, thus preventing the expansion of an engagement beyond desired limitsLuresDeceptive systems and artifacts intended to serve as decoys, breadcrumbs, or bait to elicit a specific response from the adversaryNetwork ManipulationMake changes to network properties and functions to achieve a desired effectSoftware ManipulationMake changes to a system’s software properties and functions to achieve a desired effect
Note that some Engage activities appear in several approaches. For instance, Isolation (EAC0020) is part not only of the Disrupt (EAP0005) approach, but is also included in the Prevent (EAP0003), since isolation techniques can also be used to hinder the ability of an adversary to conduct operations as intended.The information that is provided for Engage activities is richer than for the other components of the framework. Thus, in addition to descriptions and detailed definitions, which are provided for all the components, the following specific information is included for most activities:A list of references to relevant research papers and technical documents that provide more details regarding a particular activity.A list of related ATT&CK tactics, alongside an explanation of the vulnerabilities that those tactics reveal about the adversaries using them.
We consider that this additional information is particularly important from a defense training perspective, as trainees can use it to expand their practical knowledge.
