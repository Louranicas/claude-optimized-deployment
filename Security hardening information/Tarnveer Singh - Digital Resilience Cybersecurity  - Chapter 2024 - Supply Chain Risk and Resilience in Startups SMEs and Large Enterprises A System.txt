Third-Party Risk Management and Surface Risk Assessment
DOI: 10.4324/9781003604969-10


Third-Party Risk Management
In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, organisations often rely on third-party vendors, suppliers, and partners to support various aspects of their operations. However, this interdependence can pose significant challenges in maintaining robust cybersecurity measures. Third parties, ranging from cloud service providers to software vendors and contractors, introduce potential vulnerabilities that can compromise an organisation’s security posture.
Tran et al. (2024) contend that cybersecurity awareness plays an important role in shaping attitudes and intention.1 In this context, it is not just employees making changes to IT infrastructure – contractors, vendors, developers, and other third parties may be making even greater changes daily and subject to even higher levels of risk.
Third parties may see your organisation as just one of thousands of clients. They often don’t have a good understanding of your organisation, its culture, its corporate strategies, its business needs, its resourcing constraints, or its operational challenges. But also vice versa. That gap must be bridged to improve security.
Thakur (2024) argues security awareness training is highly beneficial, but this does not stop at employees; all key parties making regular changes benefit from training and awareness activities and to reduce time and resource this can be carried out on a risk-based approach.2
Chaudhary (2024) argues security awareness training tailored to different stakeholders is vital. One of the primary challenges is the lack of control and visibility over third-party security practices. Organisations have limited insight into the cybersecurity measures implemented by their partners, making it difficult to assess and mitigate potential risks effectively. Additionally, third parties may have varying levels of cybersecurity awareness and expertise, leading to inconsistent or inadequate security measures across the supply chain.3
Another challenge arises from the complexity of managing multiple third-party relationships. Each partnership may have unique security requirements, data-sharing protocols, and communication channels, making it arduous to maintain a consistent and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. Furthermore, the integration of third-party systems and applications with an organisation’s internal infrastructure can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed and secured.
Allahham et al. (2024) argue there are technical controls and monitoring that can be put in place using big data and artificial intelligence, enabling risk alerting for management. However, the human factors involving third parties are often overlooked.4
Addressing the challenges posed by third parties in cybersecurity requires a proactive and comprehensive approach that emphasises human security education and awareness. By equipping third-party personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to identify and mitigate cyber threats, organisations can significantly enhance their overall security posture.
Human security education and awareness programmes should be tailored to the specific needs and roles of third-party personnel. These programmes should cover a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity fundamentals, threat identification and prevention, data protection and privacy regulations, secure coding practices (for software vendors), incident response and reporting procedures.
Additionally, these programmes should incorporate intelligence on live threat vectors, from previous security incidents, practical exercises, simulations, and real-world scenarios to reinforce the learned concepts and promote active engagement.
Empowering third parties through human security education and awareness offers numerous benefits for organisations. By ensuring that third-party personnel are well-versed in cybersecurity best practices, organisations can mitigate the risks associated with third-party vulnerabilities and data breaches. Many regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), mandate organisations to ensure the security and privacy of data shared with third parties. Empowering third parties through education and awareness can help organisations meet these compliance requirements. By investing in the cybersecurity education of third-party personnel, organisations demonstrate their commitment to maintaining a secure and trustworthy partnership. This can foster stronger collaboration and facilitate smoother integration of third-party systems and services. Proactive cybersecurity measures, including human security education and awareness, can help organisations avoid the substantial financial and reputational costs associated with data breaches and cyber incidents involving third parties. Organisations that prioritise the cybersecurity empowerment of their third-party partners can differentiate themselves in the market, positioning themselves as trusted and secure partners for potential clients and customers.
Strategies for implementing human security education and awareness programmes are important for embedding cultural change. Implementing effective human security education and awareness programmes for third parties requires a strategic and comprehensive approach.
Perform thorough risk assessments to identify the specific third-party relationships and personnel that require focused cybersecurity training and awareness initiatives. Regular supplier and service reviews enable communication between security and the third parties to mutually improve services to become both a good supplier and good customer, provide security support or awareness, agree corrective actions, and mitigate risks. Design training programmes that cater to the unique roles, responsibilities, and cybersecurity challenges faced by different third-party personnel. Incorporate interactive elements, real-world scenarios, and hands-on exercises to maximise engagement and knowledge retention.
Develop and communicate clear policies and guidelines outlining the cybersecurity expectations and requirements for third-party personnel. These policies should cover areas such as data handling, access controls, incident reporting, and compliance with relevant regulations. Implement ongoing training and awareness initiatives to ensure that third-party personnel remain up to date with the latest cybersecurity threats, best practices, and regulatory changes.
Utilise technology solutions and automation tools to streamline the delivery and tracking of cybersecurity training and awareness programmes for third parties. This can include online training platforms, gamification techniques, and automated assessment and reporting mechanisms. Facilitate open communication channels and knowledge-sharing platforms where third-party personnel can collaborate, exchange best practices, and seek guidance on cybersecurity-related matters. Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the human security education and awareness programmes for third parties. Collect feedback, analyse metrics, and make necessary adjustments to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with evolving cybersecurity needs.

Case Studies
Case studies are useful in showcasing the impact of successful empowerment initiatives. Several organisations have successfully implemented initiatives to empower third parties through human security education and awareness, resulting in improved cybersecurity postures and strengthened partnerships.
Bank of America: This major bank recognised the importance of cybersecurity education for its third-party vendors and contractors. They developed a comprehensive online training programme that covered topics such as data protection, secure coding practices, and incident response procedures. Completion of this training was made a mandatory requirement for all third-party personnel accessing the bank’s systems and data. As a result, the bank experienced a significant reduction in third-party-related security incidents and improved compliance with industry regulations.
Microsoft Corp: As a leading software provider, this company understood the critical role of secure coding practices in mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of their products. They implemented a rigorous cybersecurity training programme for their third-party software development partners, focusing on secure coding methodologies, threat modelling, and secure software development life cycles (SDLC). This initiative not only enhanced the security of their software offerings but also fostered stronger partnerships with their third-party developers, leading to increased trust and collaboration.
The Cigna Group (CI): Recognising the sensitivity of patient data and the importance of compliance with healthcare regulations, this organisation prioritised cybersecurity education for its third-party medical service providers and vendors. They developed tailored training programmes that covered topics such as HIPAA compliance, data encryption, and incident response protocols specific to the healthcare industry. This initiative not only strengthened the organisation’s overall security posture but also demonstrated its commitment to protecting patient privacy, enhancing its reputation and trustworthiness within the healthcare community.

Collaborative Approaches
To support organisations in their efforts to empower third parties through human security education and awareness, various resources are available.
Many industry associations and professional organisations offer cybersecurity training programmes, certifications, and educational resources specifically tailored for third-party personnel. Examples include the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2), SANS Institute, and the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC).
Government agencies and regulatory bodies often provide guidance, best practices, and educational materials related to cybersecurity and data protection. Organisations can leverage resources from agencies like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).
A wide range of online training platforms and educational resources are available, offering self-paced courses, webinars, and interactive learning experiences. Examples include Coursera, edX, and Cybrary.
Attending cybersecurity conferences and events can provide valuable opportunities for third-party personnel to learn from industry experts, participate in workshops, and network with peers. Events like the RSA Conference, Black Hat, and the SANS Cyber Security Training & Certifications can offer valuable insights and knowledge-sharing opportunities.
Many vendors and service providers offer specialised training and documentation related to their products and services. Organisations should leverage these resources to ensure that third-party personnel are proficient in the secure implementation and usage of the specific technologies and solutions they employ.
Collaborative approaches are helpful to cybersecurity involving third parties. Enhancing cybersecurity through the empowerment of third parties requires a collaborative and inclusive approach. Organisations should actively involve third-party partners in their cybersecurity initiatives, fostering open communication, knowledge sharing, and joint efforts to mitigate risks and strengthen overall security postures.
Create dedicated committees or working groups that include representatives from both the organisation and its third-party partners. These forums can facilitate discussions, coordinate cybersecurity efforts, and ensure alignment on security policies, procedures, and best practices.
Collaborate with third-party partners to perform comprehensive risk assessments and security audits. This collaborative approach allows for a holistic understanding of potential vulnerabilities, shared risks, and the identification of areas requiring focused attention and mitigation strategies.
Establish coordinated incident response plans that outline roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols in the event of a cybersecurity incident involving both the organisation and its third-party partners. Regular testing and simulations can help validate the effectiveness of these plans and ensure seamless collaboration during critical situations.
Facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity-related information, threat intelligence, and best practices among the organisation and its third-party partners. This can involve establishing secure communication channels, hosting regular meetings or forums, and leveraging industry-specific information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs).
Engage in collaborative cybersecurity exercises and simulations that involve both the organisation and its third-party partners. These realistic scenarios can help identify potential gaps, test incident response capabilities, and foster a culture of continuous improvement and preparedness.
Work towards aligning cybersecurity policies, standards, and control frameworks across the organisation and its third-party partners. This alignment ensures a consistent and cohesive approach to cybersecurity, reducing potential vulnerabilities and facilitating seamless integration of security measures.
By fostering collaborative approaches to cybersecurity involving third parties, organisations can leverage collective expertise, share resources, and establish a unified front against cyber threats, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture of the entire ecosystem.
In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the role of empowered third parties will become increasingly crucial. As organisations continue to rely on external partners and vendors for various aspects of their operations, ensuring their cybersecurity preparedness and awareness is paramount.
By investing in human security education and awareness programmes for third parties, organisations can mitigate risks, enhance compliance, foster trust, and strengthen their overall security posture. Empowered third-party personnel, equipped with the knowledge and skills to identify and mitigate cyber threats, become valuable assets in an organisation’s cybersecurity strategy.
The future of cybersecurity will demand a collaborative and inclusive approach, where organisations and their third-party partners work together to address shared risks, exchange threat intelligence, and implement coordinated incident response plans. By fostering open communication, knowledge sharing, and joint efforts, organisations can leverage the collective expertise and resources of their third-party ecosystem, creating a unified front against cyber threats.
As technology continues to evolve and cyber threats become more sophisticated, the importance of human security education and awareness will only intensify. Organisations that prioritise the empowerment of their third-party partners through comprehensive training programmes, collaborative initiatives, and continuous learning will be better positioned to navigate the complexities of the cybersecurity landscape and maintain a resilient and secure operational environment.
Kwong and Pearlson (2024) contend that SMEs are particularly struggling with supply chain cybersecurity and especially with Third Party Risk Management (TPRM). Facing significant cyber threats, organisations are transforming to enhance capabilities amid growing uncertainties. Those investing in TPRM maturity navigate complexities more agilely, becoming more sustainable, resilient, and trustworthy, often through digital transformation.5
Employees view TPRM practices positively, especially in organisations investing in capability and agility to meet evolving expectations. Organisational cultures are increasingly supportive of managing ESG risks and opportunities related to third parties, using more quantitative assessments despite data quality concerns. However, according to a Deloitte report on Third Party Risk Management many miss synergies between sustainability and resilience initiatives.6
Chukwu et al. (2024) argue organisations must prioritise supply chain resilience and ensure all third parties they partner with engage fully. They contend this must involve emerging technologies to provide transparency such as AI-driven risk assessment and mitigation to drive improvement in TPRM.7
Embedding strong resilience practices across the extended enterprise is a priority, shifting from “Just in Time” to “Just in Case”. This involves better integration of business strategy and risk, supported by technology. Mature TPRM practices aim to deepen trust with third parties through transparency, reliability, capability, and humanity, moving governance from questionnaires to collaborative innovation and performance discussions.
Rapidly evolving third-party risks drive organisations to pursue digital transformation for operational excellence in TPRM. Automation, smarter segmentation, due diligence, and monitoring, using internal and external data, ensure oversight is proportionate to risks.
TPRM has potential to enhance performance, especially in mature organisations. These organisations better understand and manage complex risks, reflecting higher optimism among those involved in third-party management. Investment priorities include revisiting TPRM frameworks to ensure they are fit for purpose and adopting human-centric, systems-driven approaches. This highlights the need for top talent to interpret data and drive action.
I recommend tangible actions for organisations to develop the appropriate TPRM capabilities to address supply chain and third-party management challenges. This includes integrating business strategy with risk management, supported by technology, to enhance transparency, reliability, and performance.
Organisations transforming TPRM practices navigate complexities more effectively, becoming more sustainable and resilient. Digital transformation, automation, and smarter segmentation ensure oversight is proportionate to risks, driving operational excellence in TPRM.
Larger and mature organisations, having invested in TPRM over the years, are better equipped to handle interconnected risks. They leverage their resources to address issues like reducing supply chain-related carbon emissions and managing rising energy costs, creating a competitive advantage.
Investing in TPRM capabilities helps organisations navigate complexities and improve resilience. Larger and mature organisations, with their resources and experience, are better positioned to manage third-party risks and leverage them for competitive advantage. Continued focus on technology and data investment remains a top priority for enhancing TPRM practices.
Increasing dependence on third parties makes the cost of falling behind on TPRM maturity higher. Third-party incidents or failures now have a larger impact, leading to potential customer loss, revenue decline, and reputational damage. Regulatory fines and financial losses due to third-party actions are also growing concerns.
Organisations aim to invest in TPRM capabilities to stay robust and agile amid evolving third-party risks. As third-party relationships grow in number and complexity, TPRM teams must adapt to maintain performance.
To address these challenges, organisations should integrate business strategy with risk management, supported by technology. This includes creating risk-based actionable intelligence and triggers for remedial actions, such as off-boarding high-risk third parties.
Organisations face pressures like managing evolving risks, compliance, and building trust with third parties. They need to produce actionable insights and respond to challenges. Data must be consolidated and analysed across the enterprise, incorporating external sources to clarify dependencies.
Key challenges include the loss of human centricity, evolving risks, lack of alignment with external providers, rapidly changing regulations, and increasing ESG pressure. Geopolitical challenges, multi-year inflation, logistics disruption, supplier overreliance, and economic slowdown are also key challenges.
To balance expectations and capability, organisations should complement in-house capability with external assistance, digitise, and automate processes while retaining a human touch. Increase subcontractor visibility through dialogue and technology, work as a community, aligning data feeds and certifications. Revisit segmentation to focus resources effectively.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Organisations must determine their level of risk mitigation to balance evolving risks and expectations. Those optimistic about TPRM are better positioned to achieve this balance, acting as a competitive differentiator.
The optimum state of TPRM is a moving target, with consequences of falling behind being significant. This includes increased costs, inability to meet commitments, and adverse third-party incidents. Understanding complex dependencies is challenging.
Organisations must invest in TPRM capabilities to navigate headwinds and improve resilience. This includes integrating business strategy with risk management, supported by technology, to enhance transparency, reliability, and performance. Investing in TPRM helps organisations manage third-party risks and leverage them for competitive advantage.
Organisations are increasingly supportive of managing ESG risks and opportunities related to third parties, using more quantitative assessments despite data quality concerns. However, many miss synergies between sustainability and resilience initiatives.
Organisations must strategically reposition ESG initiatives with resilience efforts to enhance sustainability and resilience. This includes integrating business strategy with risk management, supported by technology, to improve transparency, reliability, and performance. Investing in TPRM capabilities helps organisations navigate complexities and leverage third-party risks for competitive advantage.
Organisations must integrate business strategy with risk management, supported by technology, to enhance transparency, reliability, and performance. Investing in TPRM capabilities helps navigate complexities and improve resilience. Larger organisations, with more resources, are better positioned to manage third-party risks and leverage them for competitive advantage.
Visibility into subcontractor relationships remains challenging, impacting resilience initiatives. This exposes organisations to hidden concentration risks, which may go undetected until a third-party incident occurs. Organisations must enhance transparency, traceability, and trackability across third-party relationships and subcontractors for informed decision-making and agility.
According to an EY report on Third Party Risk Management, organisations must do better to prepare for third-party risks and ensure ongoing monitoring.8
To build a successful TPRM programme and operational resilience, organisations should consider aligning their plans to an existing operational resilience framework, such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act, NIS2 Directive, and the UK Operational Resilience Framework. These frameworks set criteria and expectations for cybersecurity, information technology, third-party dependency management, and business continuity planning and testing. Perform an impact assessment and gap analysis against the currently proposed drafts.
Fully understand, document, and maintain your third-party inventory. Develop policies and procedures. Lack of coordination between internal stakeholders was cited as the biggest pain point for organisations.
While initial due diligence is vital, more robust ongoing monitoring of third parties enables more dynamic risk reporting. Establish a governance structure. Regardless of ownership, TPRM requires input from multiple functions and teams, making well-defined governance crucial. It is recommended to have a consistent global policy with local addendum for multi-jurisdictional organisations.
TPRM programmes that integrate automation and external data providers into the supplier lifecycle and embed cross-functional workflows – e.g., procurement, cyber risk, resiliency – are more effective in managing third-party risk and reporting to senior leadership. More than half of organisations send one aggregated/centralised questionnaire, while others send multiple questionnaires from different risk domains.
Jenkins (2024) emphasises that organisations increasingly rely on third-party vendors, suppliers, and partners to streamline operations, enhance productivity, and drive innovation. Yet, this reliance on external entities also introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Third-party security breaches have become a major concern, as they can potentially expose sensitive data, disrupt operations, and tarnish an organisation’s reputation.9
Cybercriminals often target third-party vendors as an entry point into an organisation’s network, exploiting vulnerabilities in their systems or leveraging their trusted access. Consequently, it is crucial for businesses to implement robust third-party security measures and continuously assess their exposure to potential risks.
Neglecting third-party security can have severe consequences for an organisation. A breach originating from a third-party vendor can lead to data breaches, financial losses, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. Moreover, the interconnected nature of modern supply chains amplifies the impact of such incidents, as a single breach can ripple through multiple organisations.
Implementing comprehensive third-party security measures is essential for mitigating these risks. This involves conducting thorough due diligence on potential vendors, establishing clear security requirements and contractual obligations, and regularly monitoring and assessing their security posture.

Risk Assessment
Yousaf and Zhou (2024) argue organisations must also prioritise continuous surface risk assessment. This proactive approach involves continuously monitoring and assessing an organisation’s entire attack surface, including its own systems, applications, and networks, as well as those of its third-party vendors and partners.10
Continuous surface risk assessment enables organisations to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and threats in real time, rather than relying on periodic assessments that may miss emerging risks. By continuously monitoring their attack surface, organisations can stay ahead of evolving cyber threats and respond swiftly to potential breaches or incidents.
Implementing a continuous surface risk assessment strategy offers numerous benefits to organisations. By continuously monitoring the attack surface, organisations can identify potential vulnerabilities and risks before they are exploited by cybercriminals. Continuous monitoring enables organisations to detect and respond to security incidents more quickly, minimising the potential impact and reducing the risk of data breaches or operational disruptions. Many industries and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), require organisations to implement robust security measures and demonstrate ongoing risk assessment and management. Proactive risk identification and mitigation can help organisations avoid the substantial financial costs associated with data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. By demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity and continuous risk assessment, organisations can differentiate themselves from competitors and build trust with customers and partners.
Implementing a continuous surface risk assessment strategy is important. Organisations must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all their assets, including systems, applications, networks, and third-party connections. This inventory serves as the foundation for continuous monitoring and risk assessment. Leveraging threat intelligence sources, such as security advisories, vulnerability databases, and industry reports, can help organisations stay informed about emerging threats and potential attack vectors.
Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted across the entire attack surface, including third-party systems and connections, to identify and prioritise vulnerabilities for remediation. Implementing tools and processes for continuous monitoring of the attack surface enables organisations to detect and respond to potential threats and incidents in real time.
Developing and regularly testing incident response plans ensures that organisations are prepared to respond effectively to security incidents, minimising the potential impact and facilitating swift recovery.
Tools and technologies are very helpful for ensuring third-party security and continuous surface risk assessment. Organisations can leverage vendor risk management platforms. These platforms facilitate the assessment, monitoring, and management of third-party risks, enabling organisations to enforce security requirements, track compliance, and manage vendor relationships.
Automated vulnerability scanning tools can identify and prioritise vulnerabilities across an organisation’s systems, applications, and networks, as well as those of third-party vendors. Penetration testing tools simulate real-world attacks and help identify vulnerabilities that may be overlooked by automated scanning tools.
Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions collect and analyse security-related data from various sources, enabling organisations to detect and respond to potential threats and incidents in real time. Threat intelligence platforms provide up-to-date information on emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors, enabling organisations to stay informed and proactively address potential risks.
Best practices help make transparent the optimum approach to enhancing cybersecurity measures. Implementing third-party security measures and continuous surface risk assessment is crucial, but it is equally important to follow security best practices to ensure their effectiveness. Set the expectation of at least the same level of security from your third parties and hold them to account on these security measures.
Cultivating a security-conscious culture and mindset throughout the organisation, from top leadership to frontline employees, is essential for effective risk management. Security policies and procedures should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changing threats, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices.
Providing ongoing security awareness training. Educating employees on cybersecurity risks, best practices, and their role in maintaining a secure environment is crucial for minimising human-related vulnerabilities. Encouraging collaboration and information sharing within the organisation, as well as with industry partners and relevant authorities, can enhance threat intelligence and improve overall security posture. Periodic risk assessments and security audits should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures and identify areas for improvement.

Case Studies
Case studies are useful to demonstrate successful third-party security and continuous surface risk assessment. As an experienced CISO I have worked with countless organisations over the years to successfully implement third-party security measures. I can share the impact of implementing security measures and continuous surface risk assessment strategies, demonstrating the benefits of these approaches:

Built Technologies: A leading fintech implemented a comprehensive vendor risk management programme, including continuous monitoring of third-party systems and connections. This proactive approach enabled the bank to identify and mitigate a potential data breach originating from a vendor’s system, preventing significant financial losses and reputational damage.11
Chapters Health System: A large health organisation adopted a continuous surface risk assessment strategy, leveraging automated vulnerability scanning and threat intelligence platforms. This approach helped the organisation identify and address vulnerabilities in its systems and those of its third-party vendors, ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations and protecting sensitive patient data.12
Nexus Technologies: A leading IT solutions company implemented a robust third-party security programme, including thorough due diligence, security requirements, and continuous monitoring of vendor systems. This approach enabled the company to quickly identify and remediate a vulnerability in a third-party component, preventing potential exploitation and protecting its customers’ data and systems.13

In today’s interconnected business environment, third-party security and continuous surface risk assessment are critical components of an effective cybersecurity strategy. By implementing robust measures to assess and mitigate third-party risks, and continuously monitoring and assessing the entire attack surface, organisations can proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities and threats.
The key messages are that third-party security breaches pose significant risks to organisations, including data breaches, financial losses, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. Continuous surface risk assessment enables organisations to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and threats in real time, staying ahead of evolving cyber threats. Implementing a continuous surface risk assessment strategy involves maintaining an asset inventory, leveraging threat intelligence, conducting vulnerability scanning, implementing continuous monitoring, and developing incident response plans. Various tools and technologies, such as vendor risk management platforms, vulnerability scanners, penetration testing tools, SIEM solutions, and threat intelligence platforms, can support third-party security and continuous surface risk assessment efforts. Following best practices, such as fostering a strong security culture, regularly reviewing and updating security policies, providing ongoing security awareness training, encouraging collaboration and information sharing, and conducting regular risk assessments and audits, is essential for enhancing overall cybersecurity measures.
By prioritising third-party security and continuous surface risk assessment, organisations can effectively mitigate risks, protect sensitive data, maintain operational continuity, and build trust with customers and partners.
Cybersecurity is an ongoing journey, and we must remain committed to helping organisations navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. Tools and techniques such as third-party security assessments, continuous surface risk monitoring, and cybersecurity controls are important in enhancing your security posture and staying ahead of potential risks.
