Correlations and discriminant validity. The heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) correlation ratio was advised for use in assessing discriminant validity (Hair et al., 2022). For the investigation in conceptually comparable constructs, a threshold value of 0.90 was acceptable, but a somewhat lower threshold value of 0.85 was acceptable for conceptually different structures (Henseler et al., 2016). There was sufficient discriminant validity as all observed HTMT values fall below the specified limitations. The obtained values in Table 10.3 demonstrate the discriminant validity test using HTMT ratios.

10.5.2 Structural Model Evaluation
None of the observed VIFs in this investigation were greater than three, showing that there were no collinearity problems (Becker et al., 2015). To determine the significance of the path coefficients, the bootstrapping approach was utilized. This method uses percentile bootstrapping, a two-tailed test, a 0.05 threshold of significance, and 10,000 resamples. The statistical outcomes substantiate that LEC induces significant and positive impact on PCFA (β = 0.226; t-value = 4.534; p-value = 0.000). In the same vein, LEC is authenticated to illustrate a noteworthy and positive impact on AIC (β = 0.136; t-value = 2.893; p-value = 0.004). Additionally, the mathematical analysis underlines that AIC has a significant impact on PCFA (β = 0.215; t-value = 4.925; p-value = 0.000). Thus, H2, H2, H3 are accepted.
The significance of the direct path (LEC → PCFA) and the significance of the indirect or mediated paths (LEC → AIC → PCFA) are shown in Table 10.
