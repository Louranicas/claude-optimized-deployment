Thus, AIC was verified to partially mediate the effect of LEC on PCFA since both the direct and indirect pathways from LEC to PCFA were relevant.

R2
R2 AIC = 0.018; R2 CFAC = 0.111


f2
f2 LEC => PFAC = 0.056; f2 LEC => AIC = 0.019; f2 AIC => PFAC = 0.051


Q2
Q2 AIC = 0.006; Q2 CFAC = 0.026




The R2 was 0.018 for AIC and 0.111 for PCFA. The analysis reveals that LEC has a small effect size on AIC (0.019) and PCFA (0.056). In the same vein, AIC has a small effect size on PCFA (0.051). The Q2 was 0.006 for AIC and 0.026 for PCFA.



10.6 Conclusion

10.6.1 Implication in Practice
Using management viewpoints as a foundation, the study’s findings provided a wealth of actionable takeaways. The research’s findings suggest that considerably more effort should be put towards developing and improving PCFA within SMEs. In order to guarantee the accuracy and dependability of investigation findings, senior managers in SMEs and policymakers alike should pay greater attention to LEC connected to data analytics, digital forensics, and other digital technologies application in forensic accounting. Therefore, the legal and ethical standards for data analytics, cybersecurity protocols for cyber forensic accounting, and regulatory frameworks for the use of digital technologies in forensic accounting should be developed and published by legislators and governmental influencers. The procedures put in place to combat cyber fraud and other related fraud activities should be strictly followed, according to policymakers and other governmental influences (Ogundele et al., 2023). In order to use new trends in forensic accounting, practitioners and policymakers need to collaborate to produce best practices and guidelines. To lessen the recurrent occurrence of cyber fraud, digitally created forensic procedures should be applied in organizations (Ogundele et al., 2023).
Forensic accountants need to retain professional skepticism, follow ethical norms and procedures, and manage potential conflicts of interest regarding LEC. They also need to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and security of digital evidence. It is challenging for forensic accountants to keep up with the most recent methods and tools used by cybercriminals because cyber risks and attack vectors are continually evolving and growing more sophisticated (Wong & Venkatraman, 2015). The accountants must be aware of the limitations of AI, which cannot yet fully mimic human intelligence (Bocean & V ˘Vărzaru, 2022). As a result, cyber forensic accountants need specialized technical skills to collect, analyze, and interpret digital evidence from various sources, such as computer systems, networks, and electronic devices (Akinbowale et al., 2020). Forensic accountants should continually update their skills and knowledge to keep up with the emerging trends in the field. This may involve acquiring specialized training in data analytics, cyber forensic accounting, and AI and staying updated with the latest developments and best practices.
The results will make it possible to prioritize the practices and recommend that senior managers in SMEs should focus more on fostering AIC there. As a result, business executives in SMEs should be aware of the benefits of contemporary information technology and look for practical ways to use aAI across organizational borders and in all internal operations. Additionally, executives of SMEs are urged to make every effort to evenly share the resources required for enhancing and strengthening the organization’s information technology infrastructure and implementing sound human resource management procedures. The findings of this study also aid in the creation of laws and regulations for the implementation of aAI by policymakers and other responsible entities, which will foster their general acceptance inside SMEs.


10.6.2 Limitation and Future Lines for Up-Coming Research
There are a number of limitations that should be acknowledged in the current research, and these might serve as the starting points of a departure for up-coming studies. Firstly, it is important to use caution when making generalizations because the specifics of the research context can constrain what can be inferred from the data. Since all of the samples originated in Vietnam, more cross-regional research is required to corroborate the results before they can be used generally. In order to obtain more in-depth knowledge, extra data from developed and emerging markets may be gathered. Scholars are advised to conduct comparison studies between emerging and developed nations in order to achieve more fruitful results. Additionally, this study’s statistical data primarily depends on a self-report design. As a result, each organization is received survey forms for just one individual. The results from a single participant may be biased because people with better attitudes may be more inclined to complete and return their survey forms. Future research may therefore consider asking other relevant stakeholders about their perspectives in this situation. The third bottleneck, which is brought on by convenience and purposive selection tactics, may have an effect on the study’s generalizability. Future research should employ quota sampling to get sample data in order to ensure that the findings are scientific and representative. The study’s fourth issue is the relatively small sample size, which necessitated further investigation. Finally, it is suggested that additional constructs should be added to the model in future studies to create a more accurate depiction of the situation.
