Chapter: 27002 - ISO/IEC 27001 provides a high-level overview of the seven elements of an information security management programme. It then offers a high-level description of the security requirements, grouped as 14 security control objectives containing 35 major categories, and 114 high-level control areas (as of 2018).
ISO/IEC 27002 offers further implementation guidance for each of the 114 high-level control statements outlined in ISO/IEC 27001, with some areas presenting multiple implementation options.
There are seven elements of an information security management system described in ISO/IEC 27001. Context of the organisation includes understanding the organisation and its context; understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties; determining the scope of the information security management system; and information security management system. Leadership includes leadership and commitment; policy; and organisational roles, responsibilities, and authorities. Planning includes actions to address risks and opportunities (general; information security risk assessment; information security risk treatment); and information security objectives and planning to achieve them. Support includes resources; competence; awareness; communication; and documented information. Operation includes operational planning and control; information security risk assessment; and information security risk treatment. Performance evaluation includes monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation; internal audit; and management review. Improvement including nonconformity and corrective action; and continual improvement.
There are 14 control objectives from ISO/IEC 27001 and IEC/ISO 27002. Information security policies include management direction for information security. Organisation of information security includes internal organisation, mobile devices, and teleworking. Human resource security includes security prior to employment, during employment, and after termination and change of employment. Asset management includes responsibility for assets, information classification, and media handling. Access control includes business requirements of access control, user access management, user responsibilities, and system and application access control. Cryptography is crucial and this includes cryptographic controls. Physical and environmental security is vital, including secure areas and equipment. Operations security is important, including operational procedures and responsibilities; protection from malware; backup; logging and monitoring; control of operational software; technical vulnerability management; and information systems audit considerations. Communications security includes network security management, and information transfer. System acquisition, development, and maintenance is an important area, including security requirements of information systems; security in development and support processes; and test data. Supplier relationships are increasingly important, including information security in supplier relationships; and supplier service delivery management. Information security incident management includes management of information security incidents and improvements. Information security aspects of business continuity management must be considered and include information security continuity and redundancies. Compliance is a crucial area, including compliance with legal and contractual requirements, and information security reviews.

NIST SP 800–34
NIST SP 800–34, last updated in 2010, provides guidance for contingency planning for information systems. It focuses on contingency planning activities to recover from disruption of client/server systems, telecommunications systems, and mainframe systems. The guide supports the “contingency planning control” components of NIST SP 800–53, offering advice.
Digital resilience is crucial in today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape. Advice is shared in this book based on best practice and international standards to help you build and maintain resilience across cyber, operational, and supply chain domains.
Don’t wait until it’s too late. Take proactive steps to safeguard your digital assets, ensure business continuity, and foster long-term success. In the digital age, resilience is not just a luxury; it is an essential prerequisite for survival and success. By embracing the principles of digital resilience, we can navigate the complexities of cyber threats, operational disruptions, and supply chain challenges with confidence and agility. Through a proactive and holistic approach, leveraging advanced tools and technologies, and fostering a culture of resilience, we can fortify our organisations against potential risks and position ourselves for long-term growth and prosperity.
Remember, resilience is an ongoing journey, and complacency is our greatest enemy. By continuously adapting, learning, and improving our resilience strategies, we can stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain a competitive edge in the ever-changing digital landscape.
