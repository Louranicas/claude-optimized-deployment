Chapter: 1 - The 1950s–1970s in the United States 
Alan Turing’s article, published in 19 50 [TUR 50], which is one of the 
founding works in the field of AI, begins with these words: “I pr opose to 
consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’”  
In 1955, “Logic Theorist”, considered  to be the first AI program, was 
developed. This work was the result of cooperation between three researchers: 
a computer scientist (John Shaw) and tw o researchers from th e humanities and 
social sciences (Herbert Simon and Al len Newell) [SIM 76]. The application 
was programmed using IPL language [STE 63], created within the RAND and 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology1 (a project that received funding from the 
US Air Force). Here we have the essential elements of AI research: a 
multidisciplinary approach, bringing together humanities and technology, a 
university investment and the presence of the military. It is important to note 
that although the program is described to day as the first AI code, these three 
researchers never use the expression “ar tificial intelligence” or present their 
software as falling into this category.  The expression “artificial intelligence” 
appeared in 1956, during a series of seminars organized at  Dartmouth College 
by John McCarthy (Dartmouth Colleg e), Claude Sha nnon (Bell Telephone 
Laboratories), Marvin Minsky (Harvard  University) and Nathaniel Rochester

1 Today, Carnegie Mellon University. In 1956 th e Carnegie Institute of  Technology hosted its 
first IBM computer. However, it was not until  1986, 30 years later, that the university 
established the School of  Computer Science.
