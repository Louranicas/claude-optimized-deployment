thought or the functioning of the brain to algorithms? Are the brain and the 
body simple mechanics?  
Louis Couffignal [COU 52] defined the machine as “an entire set of 
inanimate, or even, exceptionally, animate beings capable of replacing man in 
the execution of a set of operations proposed by man”.  
He listed the categories of machines: machines that can add and write, 
machines that can read and choose,  calculating machines and thinking 
machines.  
In 1984, Jean-Pierre Laurent [LAU 85], professor at the University of 
Chambéry, drew up a series of observations on the state of French AI 
research: identifying research potential was a difficult exercise because of 
the imprecise perimeter of AI, a research discipline in its own right for some, 
adding techniques with various applicati ons to others; on the other hand, AI 
research was dispersed across France – th e teams were small and spread over 
the whole country; AI suffered from a ra ther negative image in the world of 
academic research and in political decision-making circles, due to the overly 
empirical nature of the discipline,  which was moving away from purely 
theoretical research, and the lack of  convincing and spectacular results, 
capable of overcoming the failures of the 1960s. AI was excessively 
associated with “gadget” applications, but at the beginning of the 1980s, the 
situation seemed to be changing, and developments in the industry using 
expert systems seemed likely to give AI the serious image it lacked. 
Nevertheless, the industr y still had only an imprecise vision of what AI 
could bring: “Some industrial organizations that are not really familiar with 
AI and its possibilities are inclined to be lieve in miracles and ask AI to solve 
everything (how, for example, can an expert system be built if there are no 
human experts?).” Researche rs investing in the discipline were still poorly 
supported and had very limited means in terms of human resources, 
equipment and funding. This situation had an impact on university teaching, 
which attached only minor importance to AI training. The situation of 
academic research therefore depended on a wide range of variables: public 
interest, the attention of political decision-makers, industrial investment and 
the ability to unite isolated  researchers and disciplines. 
It should also be noted, when reading this study by Jean-Pierre Laurent, 
that the drivers of research funding  depended on exogenous variables. 
Although the State, via its research organizations, such as the CNRS, had 
16     Artificial Intelligence,  Cybersecurity and Cyber Defense 
been funding some AI projects since 1979, the publication of the Fifth 
Generation MITI Project (Japan) in  1981 seemed to be a new decisive 
moment in political action.
