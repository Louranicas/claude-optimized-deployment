Incident Response 
– Indicators of Compromise (IOC) provided by the
CTI or like external organization has identified a potential threat vector
or actual attack. IR will direct hunt resources as appropriate to initiate a
hunt. 
This is the primary source and de facto leader over the THP.
 
Hunt
Hunts are typically focused against external attackers but may also include
“insider threat” activities. Using the inputs, a CyA will initiate a THP
activity/hunt upon direction. The hunt consists of selecting the proper tools
to use, collecting the data from the tools, analyzing the results, and
documenting the outcomes. Analysts will make use of either existing tools,
or by creation or procurement of new tools to fulfill the needs of the hunt.
Gaps in tool capabilities should be documented and reviewed by corporate
or agency leadership.  This may include Senior IR Personnel or specialized
experts to include the assigned Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). 
CyA perform an iterative process by querying the selected tools, reviewing
the data, filtering out known or non-malicious behavior and re-querying the
data. This continues until malicious activities are found.
 
Base
 
Hunts
Base hunts are typically internally focused on compliance from within the
IT environment. It is defined as repeatable searches based on an analytical
methodology that produces low-fidelity results (i.e., results that require
analyst review and cannot be fully automated as a rule). These hunts will
reside in the MHTDB. Base hunts, for example, may leverage tools such
as FireEye HX® technology.  This technology obtains endpoint
intelligence that may include, but is not limited to, Windows Services
listing, Windows Scheduled Task listing, Windows Registry Run keys,
and the Windows Application Compatibility Cache. The tool will help to
determine whether any alteration or manipulation of these key services
and may lead to follow-on review and correction by trained personnel.
 
 
 
Upon completion of a review of the data, analysts will document the
outcomes of their findings.
 
Outcomes
All hunts will end in one of three outcomes. Based on the outcome of the
hunt, an analyst will document the results accordingly and distribute to
other functions and processes as necessary.
1
. 
Nothing
 
Discovered
No indication of active compromise or behavior violating identified best
practices, acceptable use, or organizational policies discovered during the
hunt.
2
. 
Something Found:
 
Non-Malicious
Violation(s) of acceptable use or organizational policy discovered during
the hunt.
3
. 
Something Found:
 
Malicious
An active or historic compromise, which may currently or have previously
placed, IT assets, or its data at risk, is discovered.
 
 
 
Conduct Review
 
To ensure that the hunt team’s analysts remain focused on
relevant and important hunts, analysts must evaluate completed hunts and
move all hunts possible to the business case development.
 
 
Should the hunt become a base
 
hunt?
Does the analyst believe the logic utilized provides repeatable and low-
fidelity results that serve as a good starting point for future hunts, the logic
used should be documented in the MHTDB? Is the malicious actor from
within the organization or has unique access? This would warrant
initiating a follow-on base hunt for active or potential follow-on intrusions
requiring continual monitoring.
 
Can the hunt become a
 
rule?
If 
an analyst determines that a hunt may become a rule, documentation of
the hunt should be delivered to the business case development process.
The information should be formulated into a rule that can be applied to
monitoring and alert devices
[5]
 on the network. This too should be
transferred to the MHTDB. The hunt team is responsible for documenting
the methodology followed within the MHTDB and providing this
information to the 
business case process personnel.
 
Is the hunt
 
effective?
Hunts may lose their effectiveness over time, and a determination of
focusing resources on an activity may divert from other important hunt
priorities. There are several reasons a hunt may lose its effectiveness or
further need to be pursued:
Creation of a rule covering the same activity
 
set may address the threat
Completed patching against a known
 
vulnerability may partially or
totally mitigate the need for the hunt
Improved automated tools or policies may also mitigate the threat
Determination that the hunted activity no longer presents a threat
 
Hunting can consume a significant amount of time, and analysts must
ensure that their resources remain focused on real and active threats.
Whenever a CyA determines that a hunt can no longer provide effective
results, documentation of the reasoning must be included in the MHTDB
for the retirement of the hunt.
 
Event/Incident Outputs
 
Based on the outcome of the hunt, an analyst will
document the results within the MHTDB. The outcomes (reports) will be
distributed as inputs to the IR function or business case development
processes and provide necessary feedback to improve the analytical
reports provided by the CTI function.
 
Incident
 
Response
If the hunt began from information collected from an IR function,
providing feedback to that team helps improve its output. The IR team will
be notified immediately following the verification of a malicious event in
an information system or network.
 
Business Case Development
Upon determination that a high-fidelity, repeatable search has been found
to be effective in detecting anomalous or malicious activity, the logic will
be delivered to the business case development process for creating or
modifying current automated rules.
 
Cyber Threat
 
Intelligence (CTI)
If the hunt began from information collected from the CTI function,
providing feedback to that team helps improve their analysis. The hunt
process provides feedback relative to the provided intelligence including
the results of the hunt. It also supports the hunt by determining whether
additional information is required to continue, and whether any information
gained from the hunt could lead to additional and useable intelligence. Any
such additional intelligence would directly contribute to the value and
improvement of a CTI intelligence product or report.
 
THP Decision Tree Activities
 
Hunt Request (Externally-focused)
:
 A pure hunt request is typically
focused on outside threats that have been detected or anticipated based upon
IOCs. This includes actual threats to operations within the agency’s IT
environment.
 
The following flowchart shows the 
hunt request
 workflow.

Details
The hunt team evaluates
the hunt request and
better determines
whether to initiate a hunt
in coordination with IR
personnel. The
following criteria are
used to determine if a
hunt is to be initiated
immediately or if further
evaluation is required
from an input source:
Cyber Threat
Intelligence
Watchlists
The CTI team maintains
access to various
sources of intelligence
feeds that provide high-
confidence for identified
IOCs. Current
whitelisted sources
include, for example,
iSight Threat
Intelligence®.
The hunt team initiates
a hunt based upon
indicators received from
a threat intelligence
source. (
Again, in
coordination and at the
direction of the IR
team
).
 
IOC - Recommendation
to Hunt
The CTI function will
provide IOCs to the hunt
team and issue a
recommendation to hunt
when a moderate-to-high
level of analyst
confidence is obtained.
 
 
 
IOC – No
Recommendation to Hunt
The CTI function will
periodically provide
IOCs to the hunt team
that do not include a
recommendation to hunt
when a low-to-moderate
level of analyst
confidence is obtained.
The hunt team performs
further evaluation when
an IOC with no
recommendation to hunt
is received from the CTI
function.
 
Business Case
Development
The business case
development function
may periodically
provide IOCs and
complementary courses
of action to the hunt
team. This may result in
new rule request
development effort. 
This is based upon
recommendation and
approval by the IR team
where the business case
(use case) development
function deems a hunt
may be appropriate.
The hunt team performs
further evaluation when
an IOC hunt suggestion
is received.
 
Incident Response
The IR function may
direct an IOC hunt as
part of, or resulting
from, incident response
activities.
The hunt team initiates
a hunt anytime an IOC
or other intelligence
regarding threat
activities are received
from recognized
intelligence (CTI) or
support activity.  The
hunt team will 
initiate a hunt at the
direction of the IR
function.
 
The following
evaluation criteria are
used by the hunt team to
determine if a hunt
should be initiated, or if
further evaluation of a
hunt request is required:

Details
The IR team determines the search timeline for the hunt based
on the following criteria for each respective input source:
Cyber Threat Intelligence
Watchlist
The search timeline for an IOC originating from a threat
intelligence feed should align with the recommendation
issued by the IOC source. A default of a ninety (90) days
should be used if no recommended search timeline has been
suggested by the IOC source.
 
 
 
IOC - Recommendation to Hunt
The search timeline for an IOC with a recommendation to
hunt from the CTI function should be determined by the CTI
function and included with the hunt request.
 
 
IOC –Recommendation to Hunt Has Not Been Included
A default of a ninety (90) days should be used for an IOC
originating from the CTI function with no recommendation to
hunt included.
 
Business Case Development
A default of a ninety (90) days should be used for an IOC
originating from the case development function.
 
Incident Response
The search timeline for an IOC from the IR function should
be determined by the IR function and included with the hunt
request.
 
Output
Hunt request search timelines established.

The following guidance is used to perform the hunt for each
respective IOC type (all historical searches are to be limited to
the established search timelines). If an analyst directs access a
security device is not feasible, interrogation of SIEM or a
centralized log management system may be leveraged for
hunting purposes.
