Even the most all‐inclusive CS measures do not surmount all of today’s CTs. Defending a network from illicit access is the major IPSS’s goal to escape an attack by keeping an eye on logs regarding any unusual activity and responding suitably as they are not projected to stop appropriations. IDSs observe the design and notify network administrators once something suspicious occurs to disrupt the manipulated connection and obstruct any Internet or person’s account regarding illegal access to any implementation, wished‐for hosts, or other resource provisioning.

Figure 7.3 depicts how NNs can be used in CPS‐reliant CS. An NN’s overall structure comprehends the following layers: (a) input, (b) intermediate, and (c) output. Thus, the amounts of neurons per layer and of layers can impact the system’s complexity, requiring the determination of the best network architecture to handle a given problem. Three‐layer NN architectures are the most customary design picks using an AI gateway.


Figure 7.3 Neural network method in a CPS‐AI.


An NN can model human and HW/SW activities in computer simulation‐based CTs by processing inputs and delivering smart outputs for a wide information range. A layer’s neurons receive the data from the input layer and send them along through weighted neurons’ connections to the topmost layer. Mathematically speaking, the data is saved and conveyed to the subsequent neurons’ layer. The last layer’s neurons afford the network’s output. Changes to weights connecting each node happen during the training procedure and iteratively modify weight values. A criterion or set of criteria works out the weights until training stops, e.g., employing a steepest gradient descent methodology. The information collected from a given layer undergoes equations per model to produce outputs. The hyperbolic tangent function frequently activates a layer.
The NN model is nearly eclipsed in the CBPSAI system [1–15]. Since many hidden learning layers exist, it emphasizes a mechanism’s output’s critical significance. The unique ICS characteristics require some “variable structure control” (VSC) approach. Model‐based methods can introduce bias when a system changes, requiring a dynamic response. Thus, real‐time assessment may be ignored. Likewise, CT evaluation methods must be quantifiable. CPS‐AI analyzes some parameters to quantify risk conditions. Several strategies, in effect, can approximate quantitative fallouts, like threshold risk costs. Precision in risk assessment is paramount for obtaining a trustworthy defense strategy. This CPS‐AI focuses on VCS by coupling Bayesian network models banking on incomplete data to determine risks [1–18]. VCS traits can ameliorate modeling tools critical for augmenting performance by employing moment factors.
A Bayesian network can also help benchmark risk assessment. Developers can gauge risk with online parameterization via the recommended CPS‐AI scheme. In such situations, real‐time data can be delivered by ICS in CA scenarios with absent values to estimate accuracy.


7.6 Experimental Analysis
The CICIDS2019 database has been used in the simulation to perform a suggested task. Most DoS attack databases contain significant restrictions on essential data (such as erroneous duplication). Since these data are unbalanced, a duplication method is used to bring it into line to assess how well DL is working.
The performance indicators can be used for simulation purposes to conduct assessments of the CPS‐AI framework, including analyses of accuracy and loss, and to compare the response times of various request types. For example, the suggested CPS‐AI framework’s accuracy and dependability are evaluated and compared to industry standards. In the simulation, the section offers and evaluates a CPS‐AI architecture. Accuracy, reliability, request time, etc., are only some simulated assessed metrics with the current and planned CPS‐AI frameworks and more traditional approaches like AIT‐SSCP, MIS‐HCPS, OLSDA, and COIBD. Based on the results, the CPS‐AI architecture benefits more from using IoT devices and an AI model than before. History’s many assaults have all been simulated beforehand. A CPS‐AI can be subject to intermittent and continuous pulse attacks, depending on the transmission characteristics or disruption from outside the system. The suggested method employs nonlinear control and an NN. Dynamic programming theory ensures reliability and resilience. The NN estimator’s learning capabilities are used to make attack determinations. CPS is capable of significantly more than was previously believed; a new conceptual framework suggests this is happening because of the availability of additional data from IoT devices.

7.6.1 Request Time Analysis Comparison of the CPS‐AI
The CPS‐AI framework results can be compared to the results of the existing model in terms of the time it takes for the request message to reach the coordinator. Each transaction’s request time rises as IoT devices become overwhelmed by the increasing volume of transactions. The CPS‐AI framework findings may be compared to those of the current model regarding the time it takes for the request message to reach the coordinator. As the number of requests augments, the processing time for each transaction on IoT devices also increases. The reaction time of the suggested method is faster than that of the other methods [1–15].


7.6.2 Analyzing the Results of a Simulation
The CPS‐AI framework analyses, such as accuracy and loss, can be carried out using a simulation tool. AIT‐SSCP, MCPSs, MIS‐HCPS, OLSDA, and COIBD could be used to compare the new results. The accuracy of the proposed CPS‐AI framework depends on the security aspects, reliability, vulnerability to CTs, and loss. The enhanced transaction level increases the transaction request time among IoT devices.


7.6.3 Assessment of the Proposed CPS‐AI Framework’s Performance
The simulation analysis of the CPS‐AI framework is done with a SW tool. The output parameters, such as the accuracy and reliability, can be analyzed and compared with the existing models. The current models fail to utilize IoT devices and ML procedures, resulting in abysmal performance. The CPS‐AI framework with six layers with well‐defined functions simplifies the operation and ensures higher performance. The CPS‐AI framework’s accuracy and dependability, among other output metrics, are compared to existing models. The test can appropriately distinguish between sick and healthy instances, determining accuracy. An approximate test’s efficacy can be determined by counting the number of positive and negative results across all the cases. Reliability in data analysis is measured total hours of operation to the total failures.


7.6.4 Reliability Breakdown of the CPS‐AI Framework
Accuracy and reliability analyses can result from a simulation tool using benchmark datasets. The CPS‐AI shows more reliability than current models like AIT‐SSCP, MCPSs, and CPS‐AI. IoT devices and an ML/DL model in the CPS‐AI framework with layered architecture produce better results.


7.6.5 Overall Performance of the CPS‐AI
The CPS‐AI framework may achieve excellent effectiveness depending on the number of nodes used. Future work can be implemented with more nodes to achieve more system effectiveness. Different dynamic functions and disturbances from external sources can affect the CPS system in two different ways: a continuous and a non‐continuous pulse attack. Nonlinear regulation and an NN are employed in the proposed strategy. Reliability and robustness are ensured by using nonlinear control theory. Attack determination is based on the NN estimator’s ability to learn. CPS is skillful at far more than previously thought; according to a new conceptual framework, CPS is becoming more computer‐controlled due to the availability of new data from IoT devices.
The simulation results for the generic CPS‐AI framework can be compared to other conventional methods (e.g., AIT‐SSCP, MCPSs, MIS‐HCPS, OLSDA, and COIBD) on the basis of metrics akin to accuracy, reliability, request time analysis, loss, effectiveness, etc. Incorporating IoT devices and an AI model can lead to better outcomes for the CPS‐AI framework.
Manipulation of data channels, equipment details, and virtualization SW are just a few of the vulnerabilities arising from the increasing interconnectedness of the IoT and CPSs. Connecting several CPSs to carry out independent duties in a confined space is a potential future scope for this new technology advancement. The CPS‐AI employs AI as a key tool to boost the integration of CPSs in a smart system that requires little manual effort.



7.7 Conclusion
This manuscript goes through various layers of “CPSs,” correlating CPS models briefly to highlight developing secure CPS research problems. NNs examined here are to overcome the current limitations of the most cutting‐edge static and adaptable detection and protection techniques and the technologies’ current state of development. This chapter proposes a conceptual framework for further investigations. Several typical CPS layer threats and outstanding research issues in developing intelligent CPS security precautions are demonstrated by AI‐based security approaches [46–55], in the end, using IPSSs. Aside from that, the proposed work provides a glimpse into CPS safety research’s future and relevance, motivating evaluations of research issues. An approach to estimating and compensating attacks launched by a forward link of nonlinear CPSs can be developed using intelligent nonlinear system control. NNs are combined with nonlinear control in the proposed method. It is evident from this review that CPSs are on the verge of a complex program because all the necessary technology is already in place. This new technological revolution’s challenges include connecting multiple CPSs to perform autonomous tasks in a compact environment, which is a future scope. AI is highlighted as a critical tool to increase the incorporation of CPSs in an intelligent system that requires little human effort. A CPS‐AI can evaluate its performance via effectiveness, accuracy, and loss through security analysis and confidentiality. Future work can be implemented with more nodes to achieve more system effectiveness in detecting the threats and attacks related to security and confidentiality issues.
