Chapter: 7 - $ ssh -v -N -L 3306:10.1.0.16:3306 backup@172.16.10.13
Listing 11-7: Port forwarding with SSH
This command uses local port forwarding (-L) and the syntax local_port:remote_ip:remote_port, followed by the intermediate host through which the forwarding will be done. After executing this command, you’ll be prompted to enter the password for the backup user on p-jumpbox-01. As a reminder, the password is backup.
Once the command successfully executes, Kali will start listening locally on port 3306. Verify that port 3306 is listening by using the following command:
$ netstat -atunp | grep 3306
