, we escalated privileges to root and cracked the root password.
    

     The root password
    


      was
     




       12345
      




      .
     




     Here,
    


      user1
     


     on the target has sudo rights, as shown in the
    


      following figure:
     











     Figure 12.1 – An entry from /etc/sudoers is shown
    



     We’ll set the password for
    


      user1
     


     and use this account for all of the exercises in this chapter.
    

     This will simulate us having exploited a user account with
    


      sudo
     


     rights and set the stage for following along with
    


      the instructions.
     




     Exploit the web application on the target again to get a shell as
    


      user6
     


     .
