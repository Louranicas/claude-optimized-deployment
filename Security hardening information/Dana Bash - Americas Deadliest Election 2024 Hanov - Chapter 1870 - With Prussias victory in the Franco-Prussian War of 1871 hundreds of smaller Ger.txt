Chapter: 1870 - With Prussia’s victory in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, hundreds of smaller German states were consolidated into a single nation with an elected representative government, and the German empire was created. After winning its independence in 1821, Mexico had tried more than fifty different governments and was trying desperately to sustain its fragile elected government. China still was ruled by an emperor, the Son of Heaven, who maintained total control over the state.
In the United States the search for an acceptable balance of powers between the individual states and the federal government continued, even after the Civil War had failed to finally settle the issue. The unique political system devised by the Founding Fathers had been tested numerous times, often in unanticipated ways, but it had proved surprisingly resilient. Somehow, it had endured. At least so far.
But in Louisiana all the flaws of that system were about to be exposed.
The battle between Warmoth and the Custom House faction had destroyed the two-party system in the state. To convince reluctant legislators to return to work, the governor agreed to allow them to repeal his controversial election and registration laws. When one of his supporters questioned that decision, Warmoth replied confidently, “Never mind, Charley, we’ll pass new ones. And worse.”
The legislature repealed the bills, and while publicly the governor supported the action, behind the scenes he took all the necessary steps to keep a strong version of those laws in place. In some ways he even managed to strengthen them. His defense was simple: the reforms had worked. Republicans had a huge majority of voters, but in the election before those laws were passed, Democrats carried the state by 88,000 votes. In response to that, other elected officials—not him, of course—had written and passed bills to ensure a fair vote. He had signed it, and Republicans had won the 1870 election by 20,000 votes.
Like Humpty Dumpty, the old English nursery rhyme, which only recently had enjoyed a successful run on New York’s Broadway as a musical pantomime, the Louisiana Republican party was shattered and could not be put back together. It had been split into three major factions: Packard’s Custom House, Warmoth’s remaining backers under the banner of Liberal Republicans and Black voters who had rallied behind Lieutenant Governor Pinchback. With presidential and gubernatorial elections scheduled for November, potential candidates began maneuvering for support. There were deals to be made, alliances to be formed, for anyone who hoped to grab a slice of power.
After refusing to sign the civil rights bill, Warmoth had lost most of his power in the Black community. His problem, wrote the Picayune, was that by this “systematic violation of good faith...he had lost his hold on them and now must make terms with the whites whom he had so long and so systematically oppressed.”
In the grand political tradition, Warmoth’s political rivals now jumped at the chance to attack the wounded leader. Republican newspapers called him “a traitor to the state.” Democrats railed he had “stabbed public virtue to the heart and trampled it under his feet.” His enemies referred to him as a vulture, a highwayman, a political leper, a liar, a thief and a pest.
Although he continued to command support from both Black and white voters, he was a man without a party. But for the next few months he was still governor, so he controlled a tremendous amount of power and patronage. That made him an enticing figure to dealmakers. Several Democrats floated the idea of joining with him to defeat the Custom House, but the state Democratic Committee blasted that proposal, calling Warmoth unworthy of respect.
The situation grew increasingly more confused. To take advantage of the void, the Reform party was formed in February to “overthrow the present putrid Government of our state.” The new party hoped to bring together those people disgusted with both parties and willing to consider any alternative.
Pinchback, fearing Democrats would take advantage of the rupture, embraced the devil he knew. At a convention of his remaining Republican supporters, he made a final effort to reconcile the party, calling for unity and nominating...Henry Warmoth for governor.
The most celebrated author of the time, Charles Dickens, had written in his novel Pickwick Papers, “adversity brings a man acquainted with strange bedfellows.” The possibility of Pinchback supporting Warmoth might have seemed impossible. But he did it—perhaps confident that Warmoth’s reelection also would secure his own position as lieutenant governor.
There was no way the Republican party led by President Grant was ever going to give Warmoth the nomination. Knowing that, the governor rejected the party before it could reject him. He declined, explaining that accepting the nomination would require him to make peace with “those whom I consider the most dangerous enemies of the country and the state, with the arrogant dictatorial and corrupt administration of General Grant.”
Instead, he continued, “I have resolved to devote all my energies to the service of the Liberal Republican party...” to save the country “from Grantism with its attendant tyranny and corruption.”
Warmoth had grown to despise the president, who he believed had publicly “outraged and humiliated me” by siding with Casey. One reason for that, it was suggested darkly, was that as director of one of the nation’s busiest ports, Casey could funnel more money to Grant than Warmoth.
The Liberal Republican party had been created in Missouri with the objective of defeating Grant. It had a very small, mostly German following in Louisiana, but for Warmoth it had the same appeal an empty shell has for a hermit crab. It had a functioning apparatus, a national media presence and, in Louisiana, no leadership. He certainly knew the party was too small by itself to serve his purpose, but it provided a base he could use to broker a deal with a more potent party. It was estimated by his enemies that he was still capable of delivering as many as 20,000 votes, a huge number in the state.
The Liberal Republicans’ national convention was held in Cincinnati in early May to select its nominee for the presidency. Basically, that would be anybody but Grant. The convention lacked the numbers or the excitement of the traditional party gatherings, but it was still taken seriously and covered by the national media. Among the observers were a large number of prominent Democrats, including several members of Congress. The Democrats had no obvious nominee, and they were not strong enough to beat Grant on their own. But if they could agree on a candidate with the Liberals they just might have a chance. So while they had no formal role in the selection of a candidate, they had a lot of influence.
Warmoth controlled the convention with the hundred and twenty-five delegates he had brought with him, by far the largest delegation. At the beginning of the convention Charles Francis Adams Sr., the son and grandson of former presidents, was favored for the nomination. But after six ballots the Liberal Republicans nominated New York Tribune publisher Horace Greeley to oppose Grant. Horace Greeley was considered odd, eccentric, erratic, brusque, opinionated and brilliant. He was known, and enjoyed, for being blunt and outspoken: “I never said all Democrats are saloonkeepers,” he once wrote—saloonkeepers meaning uneducated people—“what I said was all saloonkeepers were Democrats.” He practically invented the modern newspaper, believed in spiritualism and strongly advocated westward expansion, continually urging young Americans to “Go west, young man, and grow up with the country.”
Greeley had used his newspaper to promote progressive policies. He had been among the founders of the modern Republican party and had served a term in Congress. After Lincoln refused to commit to ending slavery early in the Civil War, Greeley opposed his second nomination. He didn’t like Andrew Johnson or Grant too much either, believing their Reconstruction policies were too harsh on the South—and he thought Grant was a crook. He had even chipped in to post bail after Confederate President Jefferson Davis had been arrested.
But he was among the most widely known and respected Americans—and his newspaper had the largest circulation in the county—and that convinced the Liberal Republicans to back him. Two months later Democrats met in Baltimore. The convention lasted six hours, long enough to endorse Greeley and the Liberal Republican platform. For the first time in American history a major party would not run its own candidate, instead choosing to back another party’s nominee. The hope was that the combination of Liberal Republicans and Democrats could defeat Grant. It was unlikely, but not impossible.
Adding to the political mayhem, at the same time Greeley was being nominated in Cincinnati, the fledgling Equal Rights party meeting in New York nominated suffrage leader Victoria Woodhull for president and famed author and former slave Frederick Douglass for vice president. That convention also called for a new constitution, deciding the existing document was “behind the present age of civilization.”
The Louisiana Liberal Republicans convened in August to nominate its slate for state offices. State politics were in such disarray it made the national elections look normal. Like Greeley, Warmoth couldn’t win the election without the support of a second, larger party. During the previous few months, he had tried to make an alliance with one of the other state parties but had failed. He had offered deals, he had threatened, cajoled, pulled out all the tricks in his bag—it was rumored he had approached both President Grant and the so-called Custom House Republican party and offered to compromise—but he was rebuffed. Half the Republicans and most of the Democrats hated him. He finally accepted the reality that he would not be renominated by a major party.
The possibility that this might be the beginning of the end of his political career probably never occurred to him. His mind didn’t work that way. Warmoth was a survivor, always had been, a man who had been able to turn each defeat in his life into a greater victory. During the war he’d been cashiered, supposedly for leaving his post, although in fact he had been injured and left to recuperate. Instead of accepting that decision, he’d cajoled his way right into President Lincoln’s office in the White House, got his commission back and later received a political appointment directly from the president.
He still held a politically strong hand. He would be in office, with all the power that came with it, through the end of the year. He had thousands of loyal supporters who would follow his direction, whichever way he pointed. He wasn’t going to be the next governor.
But senator?
According to the Constitution, each state legislature elected two senators. If Warmoth used his power smartly, if he helped put people to office, if a Senate seat became open...
As the Liberal Republican convention opened, Chairman W. W. Pugh declared, “A great revolution is at hand. The scientist who prophesied the coming of a great tidal wave which was to engulf and destroy our planet was mistaken as to the element which was to work such great changes among us. This element is the revolution in the opinions and politics of the masses of our countrymen, a tidal wave which affects the minds of men...”

Throughout the convention party leaders attempted to create a fusion ticket, with a committee meeting regularly with Democrats and Reformers. When that failed, the party pretty much abandoned any effort to attract Black support by nominating former Confederate General Davidson Bradfute Penn for governor. Penn, who came from a wealthy, distinguished Louisiana family, had fought at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, then been captured and imprisoned for more than a year. After being released at the end of the war he came home and made a fortune in the sugar industry.
Like many rich businessmen, Penn had maintained strong political relationships. Among them Governor Warmoth.
Rather than suffering a public defeat Warmoth told the convention what it already knew, he would not be any party’s candidate for governor. He made an odd and unusually moving speech: reflective, poignant, defensive and, for a politician, remarkably honest. “All I ask of the Democrats,” he told a rapt, absolutely silent audience, “is that they will do me simple justice and charge me of that of which I am guilty. I am responsible for enough, God knows. I do not start out with the proposition that I am one of the saints, nor do I admit that they are to be named in that category either. Since our starting out we have all done wrong and made many mistakes. Let us take our lessons to heart and do so no more.”
He withdrew his name from consideration, promising, “I had no ambitions or aspirations which shall be in the way of this movement... I now declare to you that you have no honors to confer upon me which I could give my consent to receive...”
The eloquence of his closing remarks reminded delegates why he had achieved so much at such a young age. He asked the party to nominate a ticket “as will form such a band of union in its constitution, between the white men and the [B]lack men as to be like the rainbow set in the heavens, a covenant that the [B]lack people shall never be deprived of their civil and political rights, that will show that you look not at the color of the man, but that in the future you will look only to his character and capabilities...”
D. B. Penn was the convention’s nominee, but Warmoth was its hero. The love, the acclaim the convention bestowed on him was astonishing. These were his people, Warmothites, people who had followed him out of the Custom House Republican party. They supported him unconditionally, oblivious to his faults; they adored him, and this was their opportunity to show it.
After Penn was officially nominated, according to the Republican, “the Governor appeared advancing through the parquette. He had scarcely ascended the first step to reach the stage when he was welcomed by a gale of cheers which endured for several minutes and was echoed and re-echoed from the arches that touched the floor to the glister of lights in the dome. Amid this whirlwind of excitement, while men wildly waved their hats and handkerchiefs, tossed aloft their canes and threw their arms wildly about, Governor Warmoth said, ‘Let me not interrupt the proceedings, you have made the best nomination.’ The storm of cheering rose again...”
Minutes later the doors of the hall opened, and delegates burst out to parade through the streets. To the distress of his opponents, Warmoth was not going away quietly; in fact, he had no intention of going away at all. He was still a young man with the potential for an amazing career. There were more deals to be made, more elections to win.
First, he was going to play a crucial role in the coming elections. The extraordinary response of the convention was proof, decided the New Orleans Times, “that the public are anxious to have the assistance of Governor Warmoth in the great contest...and will prove grateful for such services.” And undoubtedly, he was equally pleased to provide them.
His political transformation had been astonishing. He had won election four years earlier as a champion of racial justice. “He had received from [a Black majority] a degree of power never dreamed of by any chief executive...but by a systematic violation of good faith with these people he had lost his hold upon them and now must make terms with the [voters] he had so long and so systematically oppressed.”

By the end of summer five parties had nominated candidates. The Democrats had nominated thirty-nine-year-old Colonel John McEnery, a popular Confederate war hero and self-educated lawyer who eventually would become a judge. Custom House Republicans supported Senator William Pitt Kellogg, a Union army colonel whom Lincoln had appointed a justice and then collector of customs in New Orleans before winning election to the Senate in
