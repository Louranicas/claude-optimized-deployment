# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Iqbal H. Sarker - AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence_ Cyber Automation, Intelligent Decision-Making and Explainability (2024, Springer) - libgen.li
Chapter: 9 - explores how artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) can be used to enhance the 
protection 
and resilience of critical infrastructure such as energy, transportation, 
healthcare, agriculture, defence and so on. Society is becoming increasingly depen-
dent on interconnected systems, which makes critical infrastructure more vulnerable 
to cyber threats, and other risks. In this chapter, AI technologies are strategically integrated to fortify critical infrastructure against potential disruptions. Using 
machine learning and predictive analytics, it discusses advanced AI algorithms for 
threat detection, risk assessment, and adaptive response mechanisms. The chapter also discusses how AI can enable real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, 
and automated response systems to build resilient infrastructure. A comprehensive 
review of case studies and emerging technologies provides valuable insights into how AI can be used to safeguard critical infrastructure in the face of dynamic 
challenges and evolving threats. 
Lastly, Chap. 10 offers insights into the ongoing integration of cybersecurity and 
artiﬁcial 
intelligence (AI), referred to as “CyberAI,” which represents a dynamic 
and transformative landscape. This chapter outlines the diverse landscape of AI 
variants, as well as their diverse real-world applications in bolstering cybersecurity. The discourse explores the importance of explainable AI and emphasizes the need 
for transparent models to increase interpretability and user trust in cybersecurity 
applications. Moreover, the chapter underlines the signiﬁcance of responsible AI practices, such as fairness, inclusivity, and accountability, in shaping ethical and 
sustainable uses of AI in cybersecurity. Through a systematic exploration of various 
AI variants and a focus on the principles of explainability and responsibility, this chapter provides insights that are crucial for navigating the intricate intersection 
of AI and cybersecurity. In summary, this chapter shows that CyberAI plays a 
pivotal role in shaping an innovative, resilient future for digital security by working collaboratively with cybersecurity experts and AI researchers. 
1.6 Conclusion 
We have discussed AI-driven cybersecurity and threat intelligence in this chapter, 
emphasizing its potential, its numerous forms, and pertinent use cases. Additionally, 
we have highlighted key emerging technologies that can be utilized to build an automated and intelligent data-driven cybersecurity model by analyzing cyberse-
curity data. In addition, this chapter provides an overview of some of the major 
AI approaches. It is essential to emphasize how AI-based cybersecurity strategies
References 19
differ from those that solely rely on intuition. Each category has numerous variances 
among several parameters. Overall, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the 
signiﬁcance of AI-driven cybersecurity and threat intelligence and how they are 
capable of transforming the way cybersecurity is practiced.
