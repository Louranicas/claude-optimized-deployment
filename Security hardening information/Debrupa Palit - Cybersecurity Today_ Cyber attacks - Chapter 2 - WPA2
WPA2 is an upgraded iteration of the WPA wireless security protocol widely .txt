Table 6.1: Comparison of WEP, WPA, WPA2 and WPA3
Common vulnerabilities in wireless networks
Wireless networks are vulnerable to various hacker attacks that pose serious threats to network security. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for securing your wireless network effectively. Weak encryption protocols, such as the outdated WEP or insecure WPA, are susceptible to attacks where hackers can intercept and decode network traffic. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive data and compromises network security.
Default or weak passwords on wireless networks are a common target for attackers. Hackers can easily exploit weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to your network, allowing them to monitor your activities and potentially steal sensitive information. Misconfigured access points are another risk factor. Open ports or unnecessary services enabled on access points can create security holes that hackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks on the network. Hackers also deploy rogue access points to deceive users. Rogue access points mimic legitimate networks to trick users into connecting. Once connected, hackers can eavesdrop on conversations, capture sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
To reduce these risks, it is essential to use robust encryption protocols like WPA2 or WPA3, ensure that passwords are complex and unique, regularly update firmware, and employ proper configuration practices for access points. Additionally, network monitoring and intrusion detection systems (IDS)can help effectively detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts or rogue devices on the network.
Various factors contribute to the vulnerability of systems and networks:

Complex network architecture: The intricate and extensive structure of networks can introduce architectural flaws, making systems vulnerable to exploitation.
Uniform deployment of hardware and software: Using similar hardware, network designs, software tools, and coding systems across multiple systems increases the likelihood of hackers deciphering and exploiting system codes.
Reliance on physical network connections: Systems heavily dependent on physical network connections and port connectivity are more susceptible to vulnerabilities due to potential points of entry for attackers.
Weak passwords: Networks and PCs using weak or easily guessable passwords are at high risk of exploitation. Attackers can gain unauthorized access by cracking weak passwords.
Lenient operating system access controls: Operating systems with lax access controls that allow easy access to software programs and user privileges can be compromised by attackers. They can manipulate programs for malicious purposes.
Malicious websites and malware: Browsing harmful websites that contain malware and viruses can automatically install malicious software on systems. These viruses can compromise system security and lead to data breaches.
Software bugs and vulnerabilities: Exploitable software bugs in programs create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious actions.

Organizations can significantly enhance their overall cybersecurity posture by addressing these vulnerabilities through robust network and system security practices such as implementing strong authentication methods, regular software updates, and employing IDSs.
There are various forms of network vulnerabilities. Some of the common types shown in Figure 6.3 are:

Figure 6.3: Common network security vulnerabilities

USB thumb drives: USB drives pose a common risk for networking systems. Viruses can bypass security measures even with a firewall when USB drives transfer large amounts of data between PCs. Infected USB drives containing viruses like worms can automatically install on the operating system when plugged into a USB port, often because many operating systems allow such programs to run by default.
The automatic installation of these viruses into the operating system can be prevented by changing the default settings in the operating systems, making them more secure against USB drive virus attacks.

Laptops and notebooks: Laptops and notebooks are highly portable and equipped with the latest technology drivers, operating systems, and Ethernet ports for easy connectivity to any networking system. From an organizational perspective, laptops pose significant security risks. An employee's laptop contains confidential data such as salary details, addresses, contact information, personal data, the company's crucial databases, and personal banking passwords.
It is essential to store all confidential and crucial data in encrypted form to prevent unauthorized access by third parties. Access rights to the database should be restricted or limited. Additionally, administrators should enable only the LAN port while disabling all other ports for enhanced security.

Optical media: Optical media is critical for transmitting necessary data packets across WAN networks for long-distance communication. Consequently, like USB devices, data from these links can also be exposed to unauthorized access or misuse by third parties for their own gain.
Management must implement policies and asset control rules that effectively monitor and regulate data misuse.

Email: Email is the predominant means of communication within and between organizations for business purposes. It is extensively utilized for sending and receiving data. However, email is often misused due to its ease of forwarding to unintended recipients. Moreover, emails can sometimes carry viruses that can extract destination host credentials. Hackers can then exploit this to gain unauthorized access to an employee's emails from anywhere and potentially misuse this access for further unauthorized activities.
Implementing email security policies and regularly changing system passwords are effective solutions to address this issue.

Smartphones and other digital devices: Smartphones and other digital devices, such as tablets, can function as versatile computers capable of performing various tasks, including smart calling and video calling, and they support multiple applications. They offer features like high storage capacity and high-resolution cameras. However, there is a significant risk of confidential data leakage when employees use smartphones. For instance, an employee could use a smartphone to take a picture of a confidential business proposal or quotation and easily send it to others using a mobile 4G network.
Policies must be implemented to control device access when entering and leaving the networking system environment.

Weak security credentials: Weak security credentials, such as using easily guessed passwords within the networking system, can significantly increase the network's vulnerability to virus attacks.
The network security password should be strong, consisting of a unique combination of alphanumeric characters and symbols. Additionally, it is advisable to change the password regularly to enhance security and effectiveness.

Poor configuration and use of outdated firewall: Inadequate configuration and outdated firewalls pose significant risks to network security management. Improper firewall settings at different network levels increase vulnerability to attacks. Furthermore, updating firewall software patches continuously is essential to ensure optimal firewall functionality. Using obsolete firewall hardware and software provides no effective security measures.
Regular updating of firewall software and proper implementation provide effective security measures.
Authentication and access control mechanisms
Authentication, authorization, and access control are three fundamental cybersecurity concepts.
In the authentication process, user identities are verified. This verification typically involves a username and password, although other methods like PIN numbers, fingerprint scans, or smart cards are also used. To conduct authentication, it is necessary for the user to have an account in the system so that the authentication mechanism can validate against that account, or an account must be created during the authentication process.
The main objective of authentication is to verify that a user is indeed who they claim to be. For instance, User A is granted access to relevant information and cannot view User B’s personal data. User authentication serves to restrict unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information. It enhances security by enabling organizational administrators to oversee individual user identities and access.
Some of the authentication techniques are shown in Figure 6.4:

Figure 6.4: Authentication techniques
The following are the authentication techniques explained:

Password-based login: Password-based login is the most commonly used form of regular login authentication for daily online services. This method requires entering a combination of your username or mobile number and a password. Access is granted only after both elements are verified. However, with the proliferation of various online services (apps and websites), users struggle to manage multiple usernames and passwords, leading to issues like forgotten passwords or reuse of the same password across different services. This creates opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit weaknesses such as phishing and data breaches. This is why traditional password-based authentication is becoming less favored, prompting organizations to adopt more advanced and secure authentication factors.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA is a security method where users must provide multiple pieces of evidence to access a service beyond just a password. Typically, this involves entering a one-time code received via SMS or email, along with their username and password. There are various MFA methods like One-Time Password/ Time-Based One-Time Password (OTP/TOTP) via SMS or email, push notifications, hardware tokens, and mobile authenticator apps (such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator). Combining traditional password-based login with MFA significantly enhances security for organizational resources.
Biometric authentication: Biometric authentication utilizes unique physical attributes like fingerprints, retinas, irises, faces, and voices to verify individuals' identities. These biometric characteristics are stored in a database and compared whenever access to a device or premises is requested. Fingerprint authentication is particularly widespread due to its accuracy and user-friendliness, commonly integrated into mobile phones and employed by various organizations. Retina and iris scanning use distinct eye patterns, although eyewear can affect accuracy. Facial recognition scans multiple facial features but may encounter challenges with varying angles or similar-looking individuals. Voice recognition matches voice tones to stored profiles, requiring spoken verification for access. Despite occasional limitations, biometric authentication remains popular for its high security and seamless user experience, especially in private organizations, airports, and other security-focused environments.
Certificate-based authentication: Certificate-based authentication utilizes electronic digital identities to authenticate individuals, servers, workstations, and devices. In everyday terms, a digital certificate is the digital equivalent of a driver's license or passport. It consists of a user's digital identity containing a public key and a digital signature from a certification authority confirming the identity of the certificate issuer. Users must present their digital certificate When they try to access a server. The server validates the certificate's identity and authenticity by ensuring that the user possesses the corresponding private key associated with the certificate through cryptographic verification.
Token-based authentication: Token-based authentication enables users to authenticate by entering their credentials once and receiving a unique encrypted token in return. Subsequently, users can access services or resources without repeatedly entering their credentials. This token is proof of authentication, eliminating the need for continuous reauthentication. Various frameworks and clients utilize token-based authentication.

IDPS for wireless networks
An Intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) is a network monitoring system designed to scan for potential threats, alert system administrators, and proactively prevent attacks. Intrusion detection and prevention encompass application security practices to counter attacks and safeguard against new threats.
The first practice involves a reactive approach utilizing an IDS to identify and mitigate ongoing attacks. This system can detect and remove existing malware such as Trojans, backdoors, and rootkits, and it can also identify social engineering attacks like man-in-the-middle and phishing schemes that exploit users to disclose sensitive information.
The second practice is proactive and employs an intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block application-based attacks preemptively. This includes thwarting remote file inclusion attacks that enable malware injections and preventing SQL injections aimed at accessing an enterprise's databases.
An IDS, whether as a hardware appliance or software application, utilizes established intrusion signatures to detect and inspect incoming and outgoing network traffic for unusual activities. This is accomplished by:

Comparing system files against known malware signatures.
Conducting scans of processes to identify indications of malicious patterns.
Monitoring user behavior for signs of malicious intent.
Observing system settings and configurations.

When an IDS identifies a breach of security policy, virus, or configuration issue, it can expel the offending user from the network and notify security personnel. Despite its advantages, such as thorough analysis of network traffic and detection of attacks, an IDS has inherent limitations. Because it relies on previously identified intrusion signatures, newly discovered (i.e., zero-day) threats may go undetected.
Moreover, an IDS only identifies ongoing attacks and does not block incoming assaults. To address this, an IPS is necessary.
IDS are categorized into five types:

Network IDS (NIDS): NIDS is strategically placed within a network to monitor traffic from all devices. It observes traffic across the entire subnet, compares it against known attack patterns, and alerts administrators upon detecting anomalies or attacks. For instance, it can be deployed on a subnet containing firewalls to detect attempted breaches.
Host IDS (HIDS): HIDS operates on individual hosts or devices within a network. It scrutinizes incoming and outgoing packets from the host and notifies administrators of any suspicious or malicious activities. HIDS takes snapshots of system files and alerts administrators if any modifications or deletions are detected. For instance, it is ideal for protecting mission-critical machines where system configurations are expected to remain stable.
Protocol-based IDS (PIDS): PIDS is deployed at the server front end to monitor and interpret communication protocols between users/devices and the server. It focuses on securing web servers by continuously monitoring HTTPS protocol streams. This system intercepts HTTP traffic before it reaches the web presentation layer, ensuring HTTPS security.
Application protocol-based IDS (APIDS): APIDS resides among a group of servers and monitors communication on application-specific protocols. For instance, it can monitor SQL transactions between middleware and databases on web servers.
Hybrid IDS: A hybrid IDS combines multiple intrusion detection approaches, such as host-based and network-based systems, to provide comprehensive network security. Hybrid IDS offers enhanced detection capabilities by integrating host agent data with network information. Prelude is an example of a hybrid IDS system.

Some of the advantages of IDS are:

Detection of malicious activity: IDS identifies suspicious activities promptly, notifying system administrators to take preventive actions before substantial harm occurs.
Enhanced network performance: By detecting and addressing performance issues, IDS contributes to optimizing network efficiency and stability.
Compliance fulfillment: IDS aids in meeting compliance standards by continuously monitoring network activity and generating compliance reports.
Insightful network analysis: IDS provides valuable insights into network traffic patterns, enabling the identification of vulnerabilities and the enhancement of overall network security.

An IPS complements an IDS setup by actively examining incoming traffic to identify and block malicious requests proactively. A typical IPS configuration includes web application firewalls and traffic filtering solutions to enhance application security. An IPS prevents attacks by dropping malicious packets, blocking malicious IP addresses, and alerting security personnel to potential threats. It typically leverages a preconfigured database for signature recognition and can be programmed to detect attacks based on traffic patterns and behavioral anomalies. Although effective in blocking known attack methods, some IPS systems have limitations due to heavy reliance on predefined rules, which can lead to false positives.
IPSs utilize various techniques to identify threats:

Signature-based: This technique matches network activity against signatures of known threats. However, it can only block attacks that have been previously identified and may miss new or evolving threats.
Anomaly-based: This method detects abnormal behavior by comparing network activity against a baseline standard. It offers more flexibility than signature-based detection but can sometimes generate false alarms. Modern IPSs leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance anomaly-based detection accuracy.
Policy-based: This less common method enforces enterprise-defined security policies to block activity that violates these policies. Setting up and configuring security policies requires administrator intervention.

Once malicious activity is detected, an IPS can take automated actions such as alerting administrators, dropping suspicious packets, blocking traffic from specific sources, or terminating connections. Some IPSs may incorporate honeypots, which are decoy high-value assets designed to attract and deceive attackers, thereby preventing their attempts to reach real targets.
There are several types of IPS, each designed for specific purposes:

Network intrusion prevention system (NIPS): Installed strategically at key points within a network, NIPS continuously monitors all network traffic and actively scans for potential threats.
Host intrusion prevention system (HIPS): Installed on individual endpoints like PCs, HIPS monitors inbound and outbound traffic specific to that machine. It complements NIPS by providing a final layer of defense against threats that may bypass network-level protections.
Network behavior analysis (NBA): The NBA focuses on analyzing network traffic patterns to identify unusual flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or other anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.
Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS): WIPS is explicitly designed for Wi-Fi networks, scanning for and mitigating unauthorized access by detecting and removing unauthorized devices from the network.

An IPS offers numerous advantages:

Enhanced security: IPS complements other security solutions by detecting threats that may evade traditional methods, especially with anomaly-based detection. It provides robust application security due to its advanced application awareness capabilities.
Improved efficiency of security controls: By filtering out malicious traffic before it reaches other security devices, IPS reduces the workload on these controls, enabling them to operate more effectively and efficiently.
Time savings: IPS operates largely autonomously, requiring less direct involvement from IT teams, thus saving time and resources.
Compliance: IPS helps meet compliance requirements outlined by standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and others. It generates valuable audit data, aiding in compliance reporting.
Customization: IPS can be configured with tailored security policies to meet specific enterprise security needs, offering customized security controls aligned with organizational requirements.

Table 6.2: Key differences between IDS and IPS
An IDPS is a security solution designed to monitor networks for threats and promptly respond to detected threats by taking appropriate action to mitigate or stop them.
An IDPS offers the following key features:

Protects technology infrastructure and sensitive data: In today's interconnected environment, where data flows continuously, attackers often hide within data streams. The IDS component of an IDPS reacts by alerting security experts to potential incidents, while the IPS component proactively intervenes to mitigate attacks that could lead to financial and reputational harm.
Reviews user and security policies: Organizations establish user and access policies to limit the attack surface and provide critical resource access only to trusted groups. Continuous monitoring by an IDPS helps identify policy vulnerabilities promptly, enabling administrators to refine policies for enhanced security and efficiency.
Gathers network resource information: An IDPS provides a comprehensive view of network traffic, aiding security teams in managing network resources effectively. This visibility allows adjustments to optimize system performance based on traffic patterns, preventing overload or underutilization of servers.
Ensures compliance with regulations: IDPS deployment is crucial for businesses to meet evolving regulatory requirements to safeguard consumer data privacy and security. Compliance often begins with implementing IDPs.

An IDPS functions by scanning processes for malicious patterns, monitoring system files and user behavior, and employing IPS technologies like web application firewalls and traffic filtering to prevent incidents.
Optimal practices for IDPS illustrated in Figure 6.5 include:

Establish a baseline: The foundation of an IDPS relies on distinguishing normal behavior from unusual activity. Defining what constitutes normal requires thorough discussion, documentation, and configuration. Establishing a baseline enhances accuracy and usability, significantly impacting the system's effectiveness. The baseline should encompass acceptable thresholds, profiles, report settings, and alert configurations.
Define IDPS requirements with stakeholders: Before implementing an IDPS, it is essential to clarify requirements and objectives in collaboration with stakeholders. Questions must be answered regarding the role of the IDPS within the security infrastructure, the scope of regulatory compliance, and which network segments and hosts require coverage.
Integrate multiple IDPS techniques: Effectively securing network traffic requires leveraging a combination of IDPS techniques. Organizations may benefit from network-based and host-based deployments, employing signature, anomaly, and protocol-based detection methods. Integration between multiple IDPS solutions should be carefully planned, considering direct information feeds or integration with centralized security management platforms like security information and event management (SIEM).


Figure 6.5: Optimal practices for IDPSs

Design process to handle false positives: Despite tuning efforts, false positives can occur in an IDPS. Implementing mechanisms to manage false positives without disrupting operations is crucial. Solutions should alert administrators of suspicious activity while providing options for automated mitigation or temporary isolation until manual intervention.
Ensure optimal resource consumption: IDPS is resource-intensive and can impact overall network performance. Organizations should assess resource requirements based on traffic volume, packet monitoring capacity, event processing rate, and host profiling capabilities. Considerations should balance solution complexity with resource availability and efficiency.
Regularly run simulations for fine-tuning: Continuous testing and simulation of IDPS functionality are essential to optimize detection capabilities and minimize false positives. Administrators should leverage learning or simulation modes provided by vendors to refine settings and profiles based on evolving threats and network conditions.
Maintain up-to-date information: Effective signature-based detection relies on updated malware databases, while protocol analysis requires current standards and vendor-specific protocols. Regular updates to protocol models and databases are essential to adapt to evolving threats and maintain detection accuracy.
Implement backup procedures: Configuration settings and profiles in IDPS should be periodically backed up to facilitate recovery in case of system updates or infrastructure changes. Backup procedures are crucial for preserving finely tuned IDPS configurations and ensuring the continuity of security operations.
Design reliable and available systems: Critical network segments should have fail-proof IDPS implementations with redundancy measures such as multiple sensors or management servers. Considerations should include usability, redundancy, load balancing, and network deployment options to maintain operational continuity.
Secure IDPS components: IDPS components are attractive targets for cybercriminals. Ensure robust security measures by keeping all components updated with patch management systems, implementing network and access restrictions, scheduling vulnerability assessments, and enforcing separate user accounts for IDPS administrators.

Wireless network security monitoring and management
Wireless network security safeguards wireless networks against unauthorized access and potential data breaches or malicious activities. This process is intricate and requires the implementation of security protocols to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of wireless communications.
The protection of wireless networks is achieved through the use of wireless devices that encrypt and secure all transmitted data. Standards governing wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi, are defined by the IEEE as 802.11, similar to how wired Ethernet standards are defined as 802.
