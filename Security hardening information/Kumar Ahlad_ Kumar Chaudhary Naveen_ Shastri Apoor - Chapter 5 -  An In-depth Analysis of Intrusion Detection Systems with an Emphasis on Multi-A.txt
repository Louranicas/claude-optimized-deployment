# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Kumar, Ahlad_ Kumar Chaudhary, Naveen_ Shastri, Apoorva S._ Sing - Digital Defence_ Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (2025, CRC Press) - libgen.li
Chapter: 5 - , “An In-depth Analysis of Intrusion Detection Systems with an Emphasis on Multi-Access Edge Computing and Machine Learning,” addresses the growing complexity of network security in the age of the Internet of Things (IoT). As IoT applications expand, the volume of network data and computational demands increase, creating vulnerabilities in resource-constrained IoT devices. This chapter explores how Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) offers a solution by offloading tasks to the edge, enhancing network efficiency and security. It provides a comprehensive review of network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) for IoT environments, with a particular focus on the integration of MEC and machine learning to improve detection capabilities. This chapter compares various datasets, performance metrics, and deployment strategies in NIDS design, proposing a MEC-based framework to address the security challenges posed by IoT networks. Special attention is given to the evolution of IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT), the growing demand for specialized intrusion detection systems, and the application of anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) methods. It also presents a critical analysis of security mechanisms, emerging tools, and the unique challenges of securing IoT/IIoT environments, offering insights into future trends and the role of machine learning in addressing these evolving threats.
