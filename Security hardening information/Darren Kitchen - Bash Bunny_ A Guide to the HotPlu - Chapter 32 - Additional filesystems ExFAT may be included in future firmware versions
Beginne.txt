hidden inside a regular flash-drive case is a recipe for social engineering success. Hence the popular Hak5 
USBRubberDucky thedevicethatinventedkeystrokeinjectionattacks
Building on this, the Bash Bunny directly interprets the Ducky Script language that has become synonymous
with bad USB attacks. 
With its HID attack mode, the Bash Bunny becomes a keyboard, and Ducky Script is processed with a quick 
and easy QUACK command.

RUN WIN powershell ".((gwmi win32_volume -f 'label=''BashBunny''').Name+'payloads\\$SWITCH_ 4

As you can see from the above simple payload snippet, the Ducky Script tells the Bash Bunny to become 
both a keyboard and a flash drive. Then, it injects keystrokes which instruct the Windows target to run a 
powershell script saved on said flash drive. 
Advanced attacks are enabled by combining HID attacks with the additional USB device supported by the 
Bash Bunny – like gigabit Ethernet, Serial and Storage. Coupled with a scripting language that supports 
conditions and logic using BASH, a new era of keystroke injection attacks are possible.
Learn more about using Ducky Script for Keystroke Injection attacks from the Payload Development 
section of the Bash Bunny documentation.
Network Hijacking Attacks with the Bash Bunny
Exploiting local network attack vectors, the Bash Bunny emulates specialized Ethernet adapters. That 
means the target computer sees the Bash Bunny not as an ordinary flash drive, but as a USB Ethernet 
Adapter connected to a network. It's a network of two – the Bash Bunny and your target – and once 
connected, you'll have direct access to the target bypassing any would-be firewalls, countermeasures or 
intrusion detection systems from the legitimate LAN.

This is done in such a way that allows the Bash Bunny to be recognized on the victim computer as the 
fastest network, without drivers, automatically – locked or unlocked. As a 2 gigabit adapter with an 
authoritative DHCP server, the Bash Bunny obtains a low metric. This means that the computer will instantly 
trust the Bash Bunny with its network traffic — enabling a plethora of automated pocket network attacks 
undetectable by the existing infrastructure.
These bring-your-own-network attacks are cross-platform, with the Bash Bunny exploiting Mac, Linux, and 
Android computers with its ECM Ethernet attack mode, and Windows computers with its Microsoft 
proprietary RNDIS Ethernet attack mode.
Using these methods, attack like  for example are able to steal hashed credentials from locked 
computers in seconds. Plug the Bash Bunny into a computer, wait a few seconds and when the light is 
green – the trap is clean!QuickCreds
Let's take a look at how the Bash Bunny pulls off this simple and effective attack.
First we issue the Ethernet attack mode specific for our target. If it's Windows, we'll want to use 
RNDIS_ETHERNET. If it's a Mac or Linux target, we'll want to use ECM_ETHERNET. Even better - if we're 
not sure, simply use AUTO_ETHERNET which will try both.
# Use RNDIS for Windows. Mac/*nix use ECM_ETHERNET. Try AUTO_ETHERNET for both. 1
ATTACKMODE RNDIS_ETHERNET 2
#ATTACKMODE ECM_ETHERNET 3
#ATTACKMODE AUTO_ETHERNET 4
5
# Set variables for the target's computer name and IP address. 6
GET TARGET_HOSTNAME 7
GET TARGET_IP 8
In the above example, we also grab variables for the target's hostname and IP address, which is useful for 
naming the logs that we lovingly call loot.
# Run Responder with specified options 1
python Responder.py -I usb0 $RESPONDER_OPTIONS & 2
3
# Wait until NTLM log is found 4
until [ -f logs/*NTLM* ] 5
do6
     # Ima just loop here until NTLM logs are found 7
  sleep 1 8

Then we simply run Responder on the usb0 interface - which is the network directly connected to the target 
using the Ethernet attack mode above. Finally, we wait until the NTLM hashes are captured. Easy!
With a full TCP/IP stack and all common Linux-based tools at your disposal, the possibilities for pocket 
network attacks are endless!
Top 5 Bash Bunny Exfiltration Payloads to "steal files"
As anyone in IT knows, two is one — one is none. It’s important to backup your documents. As a penetration 
testers know, exfiltration is a fancy word for an involuntary backup. To that end, the Bash Bunny features at 
storage attack mode capable of intelligent exfiltration, with gigs of high speed USB flash storage. It’s perfect 
for binary injection, staged payloads and more.
It’s also the most convenient way to configure the Bash Bunny, with an dedicated access to its USB Flash 
Storage. Just slide the payload switch to arming mode and plug the Bash Bunny into your computer or 
smartphone. As a standard flash drive, it’s simple to navigate and configure. Modify payloads on the fly by 
editing simple text files. Assign payloads to switch positions by copying files. Browse the entire payload 
library right from the flash storage. Even review captured data from the “loot” folder. It couldn’t be more 
straightforward.
