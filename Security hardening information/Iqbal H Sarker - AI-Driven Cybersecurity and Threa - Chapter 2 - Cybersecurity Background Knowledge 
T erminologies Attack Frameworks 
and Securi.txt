22 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
The core of cybersecurity is a multifaceted discipline that requires a solid 
understanding of terminology, knowledge of threats, and the ability to implement 
comprehensive defense strategies. The journey begins with demystifying the ter-
minology associated with cybersecurity and AI [ 1]. We recognize that the ﬁeld is 
replete with technical jargon, acronyms, and concepts that can seem intimidating 
to those newly introduced to the subject. To bridge this knowledge gap, we break 
down the fundamental terminologies used in cybersecurity, making it accessible 
and comprehensible to readers at all levels of expertise related to cybersecurity and 
emerging technologies associated with AI. For those new to the ﬁeld, this chapter 
provides a foundational understanding of key concepts such as vulnerabilities, 
threats, risks, incident response, authentication, and more. The chapter also explores 
prominent attack frameworks, such as kill chains and MITRE ATT&CK, discussed 
in detail in a later section. The frameworks provide valuable insights into the 
anatomy of cyber threats, facilitating the comprehension, analysis, and effective 
countermeasures of malicious activity. 
There are numerous risks associated with the digital or cyber world, from 
commonplace malware and phishing attacks to highly sophisticated and targeted 
threats that constantly evolve. Figure 2.1 shows an illustration of cybercrimes 
highlighting the cyber-physical world. As part of this chapter, we dive deeper into 
the real-world application of cyberattacks. By exploring common attack vectors, 
dissecting real-world case studies, and shedding light on the methods cybercriminals 
employ to compromise digital systems, we offer insight into the methods they use to 
inﬁltrate, manipulate, and compromise digital systems. Having this understanding

is invaluable not just to cybersecurity professionals, but also to anyone dealing 
with the ever-changing digital landscape. To enable readers to make informed 
decisions regarding the security of digital assets and data, this chapter provides 
them with the background knowledge and insight they need. Moreover, this chapter 
discusses the cybersecurity life cycle as a structured approach to managing and 
enhancing cybersecurity. It provides organizations with a systematic process for 
identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering from cybersecurity 
incidents. Adapting cybersecurity practices to the framework can help organizations 
develop robust and adaptive security postures. 
Overall, understanding necessary terminologies, attack frameworks, and the 
security life cycle is crucial to ensuring the best defense against cyberattacks. 
Whether someone is an IT professional, a business leader, a citizen concerned about 
cybersecurity, or simply curious about it, this chapter provides the foundational 
knowledge and practical insights needed to navigate it. The lessons and knowledge 
provided here are indispensable for securing our digital future in an era when phys-
ical and digital worlds are increasingly intertwined. Upon exploring cybersecurity 
terminologies, attacks, and life cycles, it becomes clear that the digital era requires 
a comprehensive understanding of technology’s beneﬁts as well as its risks. Our 
goal is thus to ensure that individuals are empowered with the knowledge and tools 
they need to navigate the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape and safeguard their 
digital assets. We all beneﬁt from the insights discussed, whether we are trying to 
secure ourselves personally, protect our businesses, or contribute to the security of 
our interconnected world. 
2.2 Understanding Key T erminologies 
In this section, we explore key terminologies within the context of cybersecurity and 
emerging technologies associated with AI. 
2.2.1 Cybersecurity 
For individuals who are unfamiliar with the realm of cybersecurity, the extensive use 
of technical phrases and terminology can frequently seem confusing. Understanding 
these terms is essential since they serve as the foundation for developing cyberse-
curity strategies and evaluating threat levels. A list of key cybersecurity terms is 
provided below to help explain this complicated ﬁeld: 
• Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, 
netw orks, and data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious 
activities or threats [ 3, 4]. For example, we can consider a national power 
infrastructure that provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses. To
24 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
defend against cyberattacks on this critical infrastructure, strong cybersecurity 
measures are essential. Thus, the power grid can ensure an uninterrupted supply 
of electricity, protect against potential outages, and maintain the stability of a 
country’s energy supply, thereby ensuring public safety and economic continuity. 
• Threat: A threat is a potential danger or harmful event that can exploit a 
vulnerability in a system or organization. Threats can be intentional (e.g., 
cyberattacks by hackers) or unintentional (e.g., natural disasters). Malware, such 
as a computer virus or ransomware, is a threat, which has the potential to exploit 
vulnerabilities in computer systems and cause harm. 
• Vulnerability: Vulnerabilities are ﬂaws or weaknesses in systems, networks, and 
applications that can be exploited by threat actors. Errors in design, conﬁguration, 
or implementation can lead to vulnerabilities. A cybercriminal can exploit this 
vulnerability and launch an attack, like infecting a computer with malware or 
gaining unauthorized access to a system. 
• Attack: An attack is the actual exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat actor 
to compromise or damage a system, network, or data. An attack is therefore the 
execution of an attack’s intent. An example of a distributed denial of service 
(DDoS) attack is when a network of compromised devices overwhelms a target 
system or network with excessive trafﬁc, preventing the users from accessing it. 
Several common cyberattacks are listed in Fig. 2.2. 
• Risk: Risk is the likelihood that a threat agent will be able to take advantage 
of a vulnerability and cause harm or damage to a system or organization. This 
refers to the potential negative impact on an organization’s assets, operations, 
Fig. 2.2 Several common cyberattacks in the context of cybersecurity (Adopted from Sarker et al. 
[2])
2.2 Understanding Key Terminologies 25
or objectives. A company’s risk level is determined by factors including the 
likelihood of attack and potential ﬁnancial and reputational damage. 
• Penetration Testing: Penetration testing or ethical hacking involves simulated 
cyberattacks on computer systems, networks, applications, or other digital assets 
by authorized security specialists. The main purpose of this technology is to ﬁnd 
and assess security ﬂaws and vulnerabilities in an organization in the same way an actual attacker would. With the help of this evaluation, an organization can 
identify and resolve any vulnerabilities before adversaries can exploit them. 
• Intrusion Detection System: The intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most important elements of modern cybersecurity, which monitors and protects 
computer networks and systems against unauthorized access or malicious activ-ity. Network trafﬁc, system logs, and behavior patterns are analyzed by intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect suspicious or unusual activity. It can send out 
alerts or initiate automated steps to protect the network or system by identifying possible intrusions. It is essential to have an IDS in place to protect digital environments, safeguard data and assets, and maintain conﬁdentiality, integrity, 
and availability. 
• Incident Response: Incident response refers to a systematic and structured approach to preventing and responding to security problems, such as data 
breaches, cyberattacks, or other online dangers. By implementing this procedure, organizations can detect, prevent, and eliminate security breaches as quickly as possible while minimizing the impact they have on their operations. Following 
a well-crafted incident response strategy may help businesses minimize possible damage to their systems, data, and reputation. Digital landscapes require this strategy for not only resolving security issues but also for maintaining an 
organization’s overall resilience and security posture. 
• Cyber Teaming: The concept of cyber teaming, which consists of red, blue, and white teams, represents a holistic approach to cybersecurity. “Red teams” 
act as simulated attackers, employing offensive tactics to identify weaknesses, while “blue teams” diligently defend against simulated threats, boosting the organization’s resilience. The “white team” orchestrates this collaborative game, 
ensuring fair play, deﬁning engagement rules, and analyzing overall effective-ness. By working together, these teams simulate real-world scenarios, uncover weaknesses, and strengthen defenses. With an adversarial perspective, the red 
team challenges the blue team to improve their responses, while the white team ensures that all teams are learning constructively. Organizations beneﬁt from this orchestrated cyber teaming by strengthening their security posture and 
continuously improving their defense against cyber threats that are ever evolving. 
These cybersecurity terms offer a basic comprehension of the concepts and 
principles that form the basis of the subject of digital security. In an evolving cybersecurity landscape, people and organizations need to understand these termi-nologies to protect their data and digital assets. In the following, we also deﬁne 
some emerging technologies within the broad area of AI that can be used to solve various cybersecurity issues.
26 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
2.2.2 Emerging T echnologies 
The term emerging technology typically refers to innovations and advancements that 
are in the early stages of development and have the potential to have a signiﬁcant 
impact on society, business, and everyday life. Many of these technologies represent 
novel approaches, concepts, or applications that have not yet been widely adopted, 
but show promise for signiﬁcant growth and inﬂuence. Some of these potential 
technologies that can contribute in the context of cybersecurity are summarized 
below: 
• Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI): Artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to transform 
cybersecurity, ushering in an era of enhanced threat detection, proactive defense 
mechanisms, and efﬁcient incident response [ 1]. By utilizing machine learning 
algorithms, AI enables cybersecurity systems to rapidly analyze data, extract 
patterns, and identify anomalous behavior indicative of malicious activity. It 
boosts traditional security measures while enabling previously unknown threats 
to be detected. Furthermore, AI’s adaptive nature allows cybersecurity defenses 
to evolve in tandem with the dynamic threat landscape, providing a proactive and 
resilient defense against sophisticated cyberattacks. With AI strategies ranging 
from automated vulnerability assessments to real-time behavioral analytics, 
enterprises can fortify their digital landscapes with robust, efﬁcient, and adaptive 
cybersecurity strategies. 
• Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning holds enormous potential for cyber-
security, revolutionizing the way organizations defend against cyber threats. The 
use of machine learning algorithms empowers cybersecurity systems to analyze 
patterns, detect anomalies, and identify potential security threats automatically 
[2]. By continuously learning from large datasets, machine learning models can 
recognize previously unknown malware and sophisticated attack vectors. Having 
this proactive capability enhances the resilience of cybersecurity defenses, 
enabling swift and adaptive responses to emerging cyber threats. The power 
of machine learning to automate threat detection, streamline incident response, 
and prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk signiﬁcantly enhances cybersecurity 
strategies, enhancing their effectiveness. As a result, it plays a crucial role in the 
ongoing battle against cyber adversaries. 
• Deep Learning (DL): The potential of deep learning in cybersecurity is immense, 
leveraging intricate neural networks to enhance threat detection and mitigation. 
Deep learning models, especially neural networks with multiple layers, can 
detect complex patterns and relationships within vast datasets. As a result, 
sophisticated and previously unknown threats can be identiﬁed more accurately 
in cybersecurity. Deep learning is more useful for tasks like intrusion detection, 
malware analysis, and anomaly detection, providing a deep understanding of 
cyber threats [ 5]. With the capability of unsupervised learning, these systems 
are capable of automatically adapting to emerging threats, offering a dynamic 
defense against ever-evolving threats. Adaptive and advanced threat detection 
capabilities provided by deep learning continue to become increasingly signiﬁ-
cant as deep learning advances.
2.2 Understanding Key Terminologies 27
• Data Science (DS): The power of data science in cybersecurity lies in its ability to 
transform large, diverse datasets into actionable insights, enabling organizations 
to strengthen their digital defenses. With statistical analysis, machine learning, 
and predictive modeling, data science can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies 
that could indicate cyber threats [ 6]. The application of data science enhances 
the capacity to detect and mitigate potential risks by analyzing network trafﬁc, 
user behavior, and system logs. Additionally, data-driven decision-making helps 
organizations develop robust cybersecurity strategies, enabling them to proac-
tively address vulnerabilities and respond to evolving threats. In an era where 
data is an essential element of cybersecurity, data science methodologies can 
help safeguard against the complexities of the digital threat landscape. 
• Large Language Modeling (LLM): Large language modeling has huge potential 
for cybersecurity as natural language processing (NLP) technologies become 
increasingly integral to threat intelligence and security operations. By processing 
vast amounts of textual data, these models help uncover hidden patterns and 
potential risks in documents, communication channels, and online discussions. 
Language models with extensive linguistic knowledge are capable of parsing 
and analyzing complex textual data, enabling better identiﬁcation and analysis of 
security information. They are particularly useful for analyzing phishing emails, 
detecting malicious code within textual content, and extracting valuable insights 
from security reports. Furthermore, their contextual understanding allows them 
to interpret language nuancedly, allowing them to recognize emerging threats and 
vulnerabilities. Organizations can improve their capability to address the intricate 
language-based aspects of cyber threats by integrating large language models into 
cybersecurity frameworks. 
• Generative AI: Generative AI has the potential to enhance organizations’ 
defenses through advanced testing and simulation by producing synthetic yet 
realistic data. In particular, adversarial machine learning models can simulate 
novel cyber threats, helping security systems adapt to new threats. The models 
enable the creation of diverse datasets for training machine learning algorithms, 
ensuring robustness against evolving attack vectors. Further, generative AI can 
be used to generate realistic scenarios for testing incident response capabilities 
and proactively identifying vulnerabilities. With generative AI, organizations can 
enhance their resilience to sophisticated threats, fostering proactive and adaptive 
security. 
• Explainable AI (XAI): Explainable AI (XAI) has the potential to foster trust, 
transparency, and effective decision-making in cybersecurity. The ability to 
interpret and understand AI systems’ decision-making processes is increasingly 
important for threat detection and response. The main purpose of explainable AI 
is to provide cybersecurity professionals with insight into how AI models make 
decisions, enabling them to comprehend and validate their rationales. Through 
this transparency, biases can be identiﬁed and redressed, and human experts 
and AI algorithms can collaborate more effectively. In addition to providing 
a more interpretable threat assessment, explainable AI enhances cybersecurity 
ecosystem accountability and reliability, ultimately strengthening the resilience
28 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
of digital defenses. AI technology deployment should be ethical, transparent, and 
reliable, and thus the terms “XAI,” “responsible AI,” and “trustworthy AI” can 
be interrelated. 
• Digital Twin: The potential of digital twin technology for cybersecurity is 
groundbreaking, offering a proactive approach to safeguarding digital infras-
tructures. It allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of the behaviors and 
interactions of physical or digital entities through the creation of a virtual replica. 
With this technology, an organization’s digital environment can be compre-
hensively and dynamically represented, enabling continuous threat monitoring. 
The digital twin allows cybersecurity professionals to identify weaknesses and 
implement preventive measures before they are exploited in the real world by 
simulating potential cyber threats. With the ability to mimic and analyze the 
entire cyber landscape in a secure virtual environment, digital twin technology 
proves to be a promising weapon in the ongoing ﬁght against cyberattacks. 
2.3 Cyber Kill Chain 
The term “intrusion kill chain (IKC),” also known as “cyber kill chain (CKC)” 
[7], refers to the sequence of actions that an advanced persistent threat (APT) 
or cyberattacker usually follows to gain access to a target machine or network. 
By dividing the attack process into multiple distinct phases, the model aids 
organizations in comprehending and defending against cyberattacks. Figure 2.3 
shows an illustration of cyber kill chain phases, discussed below. 
Fig. 2.3 An illustration of cyber kill chain phases [ 8]
2.3 Cyber Kill Chain 29
2.3.1 Reconnaissance 
The cyber kill chain typically originates with this reconnaissance phase, where 
cyberattackers systematically collect critical information about their target. Identify-
ing potential vulnerabilities, an in-depth understanding of the target’s infrastructure, 
and pinpointing possible entry points are all included in this phase. Attackers gain critical information about the strengths and weaknesses of their target through a 
variety of methods like data mining, social engineering, and network scanning. This information then inﬂuences their attack plan for the future phases. Thus early detection and mitigation of reconnaissance operations is generally important to an 
effective defense against cyber threats. A strong security framework and increased user awareness are essential during this early stage of reconnaissance activity identiﬁcation and mitigation. 
2.3.2 W eaponization 
Cyber adversaries carefully prepare their collection of malicious resources during 
this weaponization phase of the cyber kill chain. This is the development or 
acquisition of malicious payloads, like as malware or weaponized documents, that are meticulously designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the target system. 
Weaponization serves as a crucial transitional phase, marking the shift from initial reconnaissance to active stages of attack. Attackers focus their efforts on creating advanced tools and strategies to get around security measures during this phase to 
successfully deliver their harmful payloads to the target. It emphasizes how crucial it is for businesses to put strong security measures into operation to detect and prevent dangerous payloads and reduce the likelihood that cyberattacks will be successful. 
2.3.3 Delivery 
Cyber adversaries execute their plan to deliver harmful payloads to the target system or network during this delivery phase of the cyber kill chain. Techniques 
like phishing emails, malicious attachments, compromised websites, or alternate delivery methods are commonly used in this phase. It serves as a crucial link between the target’s actual compromise and the earlier stages of weaponization and 
reconnaissance. Successful delivery tactics often rely on exploiting human factors, technical vulnerabilities, or social engineering to trick individuals within the target organization into opening or executing the malicious payload. Organizations need 
to step up their efforts in email ﬁltering, web security, and employee training to effectively counter these threats during this phase.
30 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
2.3.4 Exploitation 
Cyber adversaries take advantage of previously identiﬁed vulnerabilities or weak-
nesses within the target system in this exploitation phase in the cyber kill chain. 
They utilize a variety of strategies, including zero-day exploits, social engineering, 
and known software vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the target system. This stage is crucial to the attacker’s progress since it shows that they are actively 
breaking through the target’s defenses and taking control of the system. Proactive vulnerability management, timely patching, and security awareness training are essential for organizations to effectively counter exploitation efforts and prevent 
cyber adversaries from penetrating deeper into the network and compromising vital resources. 
2.3.5 Installation 
Once cyberattackers have successfully exploited vulnerabilities and gained early access to the target system, this installation phase of the cyber kill chain becomes a 
crucial stage where threats become persistent. Attackers usually install malware, backdoors, or other malicious components during this stage to ensure that they can continue to have access and control over the victim’s system. Their ability 
to persevere enables them to accomplish their malicious goals, such as obtaining sensitive information, manipulating systems, or gaining additional access. It is challenging to defend against the installation phase; therefore organizations need to 
concentrate on strong access controls, continuous monitoring, and threat detection techniques to identify and mitigate these persistent consequences. 
2.3.6 Command and Control 
Once cyberattackers have gained access to the target system, they create a covert communication channel during this command and control phase of the cyber kill chain. The purpose of this channel is to let attackers carry out their malicious 
objectives by executing commands, stealing data, and controlling the compromised environment. Attackers use a variety of strategies to hide their existence, which is often indicative of their concealing operations. Organizations must identify and 
block this channel to thwart the attacker’s progress, reduce possible damage, and prevent additional exploitation of their network and resources. Organizations need to set a high priority on effective network monitoring, anomaly detection, and rapid 
incident response to protect against the command-and-control phase.
2.4 MITRE ATT&CK 31
2.3.7 Actions on Objectives 
After a cyberattack has successfully progressed through the previous phases, the 
adversaries execute their ﬁnal goals during this actions on objectives phase of the 
cyber kill chain. A wide range of threatening operations, such as data exﬁltration, 
system modiﬁcation, information destruction, and other actions aimed at advancing 
the attacker’s objectives, might be included in this phase. This stage can have serious 
consequences, including ﬁnancial losses, operational disruptions, data breaches, and 
compromise to the targeted organization’s reputation. To minimize the effects of 
these sophisticated and frequently covert cyberattacks, effective defense against this 
phase necessitates a combination of robust security measures, incident response 
readiness, and proactive threat identiﬁcation. 
Based on our discussion above, we can conclude that organizations may better 
comprehend the tactics used by cybercriminals and create plans to detect, prevent, 
and resolve cyber threats at different stages of the attack life cycle by using 
this cyber kill chain framework. It may help organizations develop potential 
strategies to identify and prevent attacks at different stages of the kill chain by 
comprehending and mapping these steps. Organizations can also enhance their 
defenses against cyberattacks and mitigate the potential adverse effects of security 
incidents by detecting and preventing the attacker’s activities early in the chain. It 
also emphasizes the value of cybersecurity best practices and proactive defense, like 
patch management, network monitoring, and user education. 
2.4 MITRE A TT&CK 
The Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, known as “MITRE 
ATT&CK” [ 9], is typically a guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks 
and intrusions, which was created by the Mitre Corporation and released in 2013. 
These are deﬁned as below: 
• Tactics: This typically represents high-level objectives, i.e., the goal of an 
ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. For example, an attacker might want to 
control a network by gaining the credential access. 
• Techniques: This typically represents speciﬁc methods that are used to achieve 
those objectives, i.e., how an attacker achieves their tactical goal. For example, 
an attacker uses a credential dumping method to achieve the above goal. 
• Sub-techniques: This includes additional details or variations of the technique 
providing a more speciﬁc description of the behavior an adversary uses to 
achieve their goal. For example, an attacker might attempt to retrieve credential 
information from the Local Security Authority Subsystem or Active Directory 
database.
32 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
Overall, we can say that MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base that helps in 
simulating cyber adversaries’ tactics and techniques and then demonstrates how to 
detect and prevent them. It identiﬁes tactics that indicate an attack is in progress, 
rather than focusing on the results of an attack or an indicator of compromise 
(IoC). To better protect an organization and defend against cyber threats, ATT&CK 
amasses information that can assist in understanding how attackers behave or the 
tactics used by attackers. 
2.4.1 MITRE ATT&CK Matrices 
Although MITRE ATT&CK originally emphasizes threats against Windows enter-
prise systems, it now includes coverage for Linux, mobile, macOS, and ICS. Thus, 
MITRE ATT&CK organizes adversary tactics and techniques into matrices, each of 
which contains tactics and techniques related to attacks on particular domains. They 
are as follows: 
• Enterprise Matrix: The Enterprise Matrix is the core matrix that covers tactics 
and techniques for different platforms and operating systems within a traditional 
enterprise network. Thus Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud environments are 
included in this Enterprise Matrix. Each cell in the matrix represents a speciﬁc 
technique for a given tactic and platform. 
• Mobile Matrix: The Mobile Matrix emphasizes tactics and techniques relevant 
to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Thus, this matrix helps 
in understanding the speciﬁc threats and attack techniques targeting mobile 
platforms. 
• ICS Matrix: The ICX Matrix’s tactics and techniques for attack are directed 
toward the machinery, devices, sensors, and networks that are utilized to 
automate or control activities for industries, utilities, transportation systems, and 
other critical service providers. Security professionals and businesses operating 
in the industrial sector can beneﬁt from using this matrix to understand and 
resolve cybersecurity issues speciﬁc to ICS environments. 
2.4.2 MITRE ATT&CK T actics 
Each MITRE ATT&CK tactic represents a speciﬁc adversarial goal, which is close 
to the stages or phases of a cyberattack. Through the tactics, the attacker typically 
wants to accomplish their speciﬁc goal at a given time. For example, ATT&CK 
tactics covered by the Enterprise Matrix include [ 9]: 
• Reconnaissance: This includes gathering the necessary information to plan for 
an attack. 
• Resource development: This includes establishing relevant resources needed for 
an attack or to support attack operations.
2.4 MITRE ATT&CK 33
• Initial access: This includes penetrating the target network/system or gaining 
access to the victim’s network or systems. 
• Execution: This includes running malicious code or malware on the compro-
mised network or systems. 
• Persistence: This includes maintaining access in that compromised network or 
systems. 
• Privilege escalation: This includes attempting to gain higher-level privileges or 
access, e.g., moving from user to administrator-level access. 
• Defense evasion: This includes taking actions to avoid detection once inside a 
system. 
• Credential access: This includes attempting to steal usernames, passwords, and 
other login credentials. 
• Discovery: This includes gathering information about the compromised net-
work/systems or researching the target environment to learn what resources can 
be accessed or controlled to support a planned attack. 
• Lateral movement: This includes gaining access to additional resources or 
moving from one system to another within the compromised environment. 
• Collection: Gathering data related to the attack or to support the high-level attack 
goal. 
• Command and control: This includes establishing control over the victim’s 
network/systems and communicating with compromised network/systems from 
outside, i.e., enabling the attacker to control the system. 
• Exﬁltration: This includes stealing the data from the compromised system, i.e., 
the victim’s data. 
• Impact: This includes interrupting, damaging, corrupting, or destroying data 
or business processes, in other words, making networks/systems and data 
unavailable to the victim. 
The tactics and techniques may vary from matrix to matrix on particular domains. 
For example, the Mobile Matrix deﬁned earlier does not include Reconnaissance 
and Resource Development tactics but includes other tactics such as Network 
Effects and Remote Service Effects, which are not found in the Enterprise Matrix 
[9]. 
In summary, “MITRE ATT&CK” and the “cyber kill chain” are two frameworks 
commonly used in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity to understand, analyze, and respond 
to cyber threats. While the cyber kill chain focuses on the sequential stages of 
an attack and is often used for preventive measures, MITRE ATT&CK is a more 
comprehensive framework covering a broader range of tactics and techniques used 
by adversaries across different platforms. Another approach, Attack Trees, provide a 
structured way to analyze attack scenarios, can be used to security threat modeling, 
stemming from dependency analysis. Similar other frameworks in the area, for 
example, STRIDE (spooﬁng identity, tampering with data, repudiation, information 
disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege), a model of threats, can 
help reason and ﬁnd threats to a system, while DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, 
Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability), a risk assessment model, can be
34 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
used to evaluate and prioritize security vulnerabilities based on their potential 
impact [ 11]. Organizations can customize and leverage these frameworks together 
to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture according to their requirements and 
assets. 
2.5 Cybersecurity Life Cycle 
The cybersecurity life cycle, sometimes referred to as the cybersecurity framework 
or process, is a structured approach for managing and maintaining the cybersecurity 
controls within an organization. To safeguard their data, infrastructure, and informa-
tion systems from cyber threats and vulnerabilities, organizations typically conduct 
a cycle that consists of several stages or processes. Certain steps and stages may 
differ signiﬁcantly according to their unique objectives and requirements across 
sectors. According to NIST [ 10] a common representation of the cybersecurity 
frame work typically includes identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover phases. 
In addition to these ﬁve core functions, govern directs an understanding of organi-
zational context and how an organization will implement the other ﬁve functions, as 
shown in Fig. 2.4. In the following, we give an overview of these phases to enhance 
cybersecurity posture.

22 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
The core of cybersecurity is a multifaceted discipline that requires a solid 
understanding of terminology, knowledge of threats, and the ability to implement 
comprehensive defense strategies. The journey begins with demystifying the ter-
minology associated with cybersecurity and AI [ 1]. We recognize that the ﬁeld is 
replete with technical jargon, acronyms, and concepts that can seem intimidating 
to those newly introduced to the subject. To bridge this knowledge gap, we break 
down the fundamental terminologies used in cybersecurity, making it accessible 
and comprehensible to readers at all levels of expertise related to cybersecurity and 
emerging technologies associated with AI. For those new to the ﬁeld, this chapter 
provides a foundational understanding of key concepts such as vulnerabilities, 
threats, risks, incident response, authentication, and more. The chapter also explores 
prominent attack frameworks, such as kill chains and MITRE ATT&CK, discussed 
in detail in a later section. The frameworks provide valuable insights into the 
anatomy of cyber threats, facilitating the comprehension, analysis, and effective 
countermeasures of malicious activity. 
There are numerous risks associated with the digital or cyber world, from 
commonplace malware and phishing attacks to highly sophisticated and targeted 
threats that constantly evolve. Figure 2.1 shows an illustration of cybercrimes 
highlighting the cyber-physical world. As part of this chapter, we dive deeper into 
the real-world application of cyberattacks. By exploring common attack vectors, 
dissecting real-world case studies, and shedding light on the methods cybercriminals 
employ to compromise digital systems, we offer insight into the methods they use to 
inﬁltrate, manipulate, and compromise digital systems. Having this understanding

is invaluable not just to cybersecurity professionals, but also to anyone dealing 
with the ever-changing digital landscape. To enable readers to make informed 
decisions regarding the security of digital assets and data, this chapter provides 
them with the background knowledge and insight they need. Moreover, this chapter 
discusses the cybersecurity life cycle as a structured approach to managing and 
enhancing cybersecurity. It provides organizations with a systematic process for 
identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering from cybersecurity 
incidents. Adapting cybersecurity practices to the framework can help organizations 
develop robust and adaptive security postures. 
Overall, understanding necessary terminologies, attack frameworks, and the 
security life cycle is crucial to ensuring the best defense against cyberattacks. 
Whether someone is an IT professional, a business leader, a citizen concerned about 
cybersecurity, or simply curious about it, this chapter provides the foundational 
knowledge and practical insights needed to navigate it. The lessons and knowledge 
provided here are indispensable for securing our digital future in an era when phys-
ical and digital worlds are increasingly intertwined. Upon exploring cybersecurity 
terminologies, attacks, and life cycles, it becomes clear that the digital era requires 
a comprehensive understanding of technology’s beneﬁts as well as its risks. Our 
goal is thus to ensure that individuals are empowered with the knowledge and tools 
they need to navigate the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape and safeguard their 
digital assets. We all beneﬁt from the insights discussed, whether we are trying to 
secure ourselves personally, protect our businesses, or contribute to the security of 
our interconnected world. 
2.2 Understanding Key T erminologies 
In this section, we explore key terminologies within the context of cybersecurity and 
emerging technologies associated with AI. 
2.2.1 Cybersecurity 
For individuals who are unfamiliar with the realm of cybersecurity, the extensive use 
of technical phrases and terminology can frequently seem confusing. Understanding 
these terms is essential since they serve as the foundation for developing cyberse-
curity strategies and evaluating threat levels. A list of key cybersecurity terms is 
provided below to help explain this complicated ﬁeld: 
• Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, 
netw orks, and data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious 
activities or threats [ 3, 4]. For example, we can consider a national power 
infrastructure that provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses. To
24 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
defend against cyberattacks on this critical infrastructure, strong cybersecurity 
measures are essential. Thus, the power grid can ensure an uninterrupted supply 
of electricity, protect against potential outages, and maintain the stability of a 
country’s energy supply, thereby ensuring public safety and economic continuity. 
• Threat: A threat is a potential danger or harmful event that can exploit a 
vulnerability in a system or organization. Threats can be intentional (e.g., 
cyberattacks by hackers) or unintentional (e.g., natural disasters). Malware, such 
as a computer virus or ransomware, is a threat, which has the potential to exploit 
vulnerabilities in computer systems and cause harm. 
• Vulnerability: Vulnerabilities are ﬂaws or weaknesses in systems, networks, and 
applications that can be exploited by threat actors. Errors in design, conﬁguration, 
or implementation can lead to vulnerabilities. A cybercriminal can exploit this 
vulnerability and launch an attack, like infecting a computer with malware or 
gaining unauthorized access to a system. 
• Attack: An attack is the actual exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat actor 
to compromise or damage a system, network, or data. An attack is therefore the 
execution of an attack’s intent. An example of a distributed denial of service 
(DDoS) attack is when a network of compromised devices overwhelms a target 
system or network with excessive trafﬁc, preventing the users from accessing it. 
Several common cyberattacks are listed in Fig. 2.2. 
• Risk: Risk is the likelihood that a threat agent will be able to take advantage 
of a vulnerability and cause harm or damage to a system or organization. This 
refers to the potential negative impact on an organization’s assets, operations, 
Fig. 2.2 Several common cyberattacks in the context of cybersecurity (Adopted from Sarker et al. 
[2])
2.2 Understanding Key Terminologies 25
or objectives. A company’s risk level is determined by factors including the 
likelihood of attack and potential ﬁnancial and reputational damage. 
• Penetration Testing: Penetration testing or ethical hacking involves simulated 
cyberattacks on computer systems, networks, applications, or other digital assets 
by authorized security specialists. The main purpose of this technology is to ﬁnd 
and assess security ﬂaws and vulnerabilities in an organization in the same way an actual attacker would. With the help of this evaluation, an organization can 
identify and resolve any vulnerabilities before adversaries can exploit them. 
• Intrusion Detection System: The intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most important elements of modern cybersecurity, which monitors and protects 
computer networks and systems against unauthorized access or malicious activ-ity. Network trafﬁc, system logs, and behavior patterns are analyzed by intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect suspicious or unusual activity. It can send out 
alerts or initiate automated steps to protect the network or system by identifying possible intrusions. It is essential to have an IDS in place to protect digital environments, safeguard data and assets, and maintain conﬁdentiality, integrity, 
and availability. 
• Incident Response: Incident response refers to a systematic and structured approach to preventing and responding to security problems, such as data 
breaches, cyberattacks, or other online dangers. By implementing this procedure, organizations can detect, prevent, and eliminate security breaches as quickly as possible while minimizing the impact they have on their operations. Following 
a well-crafted incident response strategy may help businesses minimize possible damage to their systems, data, and reputation. Digital landscapes require this strategy for not only resolving security issues but also for maintaining an 
organization’s overall resilience and security posture. 
• Cyber Teaming: The concept of cyber teaming, which consists of red, blue, and white teams, represents a holistic approach to cybersecurity. “Red teams” 
act as simulated attackers, employing offensive tactics to identify weaknesses, while “blue teams” diligently defend against simulated threats, boosting the organization’s resilience. The “white team” orchestrates this collaborative game, 
ensuring fair play, deﬁning engagement rules, and analyzing overall effective-ness. By working together, these teams simulate real-world scenarios, uncover weaknesses, and strengthen defenses. With an adversarial perspective, the red 
team challenges the blue team to improve their responses, while the white team ensures that all teams are learning constructively. Organizations beneﬁt from this orchestrated cyber teaming by strengthening their security posture and 
continuously improving their defense against cyber threats that are ever evolving. 
These cybersecurity terms offer a basic comprehension of the concepts and 
principles that form the basis of the subject of digital security. In an evolving cybersecurity landscape, people and organizations need to understand these termi-nologies to protect their data and digital assets. In the following, we also deﬁne 
some emerging technologies within the broad area of AI that can be used to solve various cybersecurity issues.
26 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
2.2.2 Emerging T echnologies 
The term emerging technology typically refers to innovations and advancements that 
are in the early stages of development and have the potential to have a signiﬁcant 
impact on society, business, and everyday life. Many of these technologies represent 
novel approaches, concepts, or applications that have not yet been widely adopted, 
but show promise for signiﬁcant growth and inﬂuence. Some of these potential 
technologies that can contribute in the context of cybersecurity are summarized 
below: 
• Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI): Artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to transform 
cybersecurity, ushering in an era of enhanced threat detection, proactive defense 
mechanisms, and efﬁcient incident response [ 1]. By utilizing machine learning 
algorithms, AI enables cybersecurity systems to rapidly analyze data, extract 
patterns, and identify anomalous behavior indicative of malicious activity. It 
boosts traditional security measures while enabling previously unknown threats 
to be detected. Furthermore, AI’s adaptive nature allows cybersecurity defenses 
to evolve in tandem with the dynamic threat landscape, providing a proactive and 
resilient defense against sophisticated cyberattacks. With AI strategies ranging 
from automated vulnerability assessments to real-time behavioral analytics, 
enterprises can fortify their digital landscapes with robust, efﬁcient, and adaptive 
cybersecurity strategies. 
• Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning holds enormous potential for cyber-
security, revolutionizing the way organizations defend against cyber threats. The 
use of machine learning algorithms empowers cybersecurity systems to analyze 
patterns, detect anomalies, and identify potential security threats automatically 
[2]. By continuously learning from large datasets, machine learning models can 
recognize previously unknown malware and sophisticated attack vectors. Having 
this proactive capability enhances the resilience of cybersecurity defenses, 
enabling swift and adaptive responses to emerging cyber threats. The power 
of machine learning to automate threat detection, streamline incident response, 
and prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk signiﬁcantly enhances cybersecurity 
strategies, enhancing their effectiveness. As a result, it plays a crucial role in the 
ongoing battle against cyber adversaries. 
• Deep Learning (DL): The potential of deep learning in cybersecurity is immense, 
leveraging intricate neural networks to enhance threat detection and mitigation. 
Deep learning models, especially neural networks with multiple layers, can 
detect complex patterns and relationships within vast datasets. As a result, 
sophisticated and previously unknown threats can be identiﬁed more accurately 
in cybersecurity. Deep learning is more useful for tasks like intrusion detection, 
malware analysis, and anomaly detection, providing a deep understanding of 
cyber threats [ 5]. With the capability of unsupervised learning, these systems 
are capable of automatically adapting to emerging threats, offering a dynamic 
defense against ever-evolving threats. Adaptive and advanced threat detection 
capabilities provided by deep learning continue to become increasingly signiﬁ-
cant as deep learning advances.
2.2 Understanding Key Terminologies 27
• Data Science (DS): The power of data science in cybersecurity lies in its ability to 
transform large, diverse datasets into actionable insights, enabling organizations 
to strengthen their digital defenses. With statistical analysis, machine learning, 
and predictive modeling, data science can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies 
that could indicate cyber threats [ 6]. The application of data science enhances 
the capacity to detect and mitigate potential risks by analyzing network trafﬁc, 
user behavior, and system logs. Additionally, data-driven decision-making helps 
organizations develop robust cybersecurity strategies, enabling them to proac-
tively address vulnerabilities and respond to evolving threats. In an era where 
data is an essential element of cybersecurity, data science methodologies can 
help safeguard against the complexities of the digital threat landscape. 
• Large Language Modeling (LLM): Large language modeling has huge potential 
for cybersecurity as natural language processing (NLP) technologies become 
increasingly integral to threat intelligence and security operations. By processing 
vast amounts of textual data, these models help uncover hidden patterns and 
potential risks in documents, communication channels, and online discussions. 
Language models with extensive linguistic knowledge are capable of parsing 
and analyzing complex textual data, enabling better identiﬁcation and analysis of 
security information. They are particularly useful for analyzing phishing emails, 
detecting malicious code within textual content, and extracting valuable insights 
from security reports. Furthermore, their contextual understanding allows them 
to interpret language nuancedly, allowing them to recognize emerging threats and 
vulnerabilities. Organizations can improve their capability to address the intricate 
language-based aspects of cyber threats by integrating large language models into 
cybersecurity frameworks. 
• Generative AI: Generative AI has the potential to enhance organizations’ 
defenses through advanced testing and simulation by producing synthetic yet 
realistic data. In particular, adversarial machine learning models can simulate 
novel cyber threats, helping security systems adapt to new threats. The models 
enable the creation of diverse datasets for training machine learning algorithms, 
ensuring robustness against evolving attack vectors. Further, generative AI can 
be used to generate realistic scenarios for testing incident response capabilities 
and proactively identifying vulnerabilities. With generative AI, organizations can 
enhance their resilience to sophisticated threats, fostering proactive and adaptive 
security. 
• Explainable AI (XAI): Explainable AI (XAI) has the potential to foster trust, 
transparency, and effective decision-making in cybersecurity. The ability to 
interpret and understand AI systems’ decision-making processes is increasingly 
important for threat detection and response. The main purpose of explainable AI 
is to provide cybersecurity professionals with insight into how AI models make 
decisions, enabling them to comprehend and validate their rationales. Through 
this transparency, biases can be identiﬁed and redressed, and human experts 
and AI algorithms can collaborate more effectively. In addition to providing 
a more interpretable threat assessment, explainable AI enhances cybersecurity 
ecosystem accountability and reliability, ultimately strengthening the resilience
28 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
of digital defenses. AI technology deployment should be ethical, transparent, and 
reliable, and thus the terms “XAI,” “responsible AI,” and “trustworthy AI” can 
be interrelated. 
• Digital Twin: The potential of digital twin technology for cybersecurity is 
groundbreaking, offering a proactive approach to safeguarding digital infras-
tructures. It allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of the behaviors and 
interactions of physical or digital entities through the creation of a virtual replica. 
With this technology, an organization’s digital environment can be compre-
hensively and dynamically represented, enabling continuous threat monitoring. 
The digital twin allows cybersecurity professionals to identify weaknesses and 
implement preventive measures before they are exploited in the real world by 
simulating potential cyber threats. With the ability to mimic and analyze the 
entire cyber landscape in a secure virtual environment, digital twin technology 
proves to be a promising weapon in the ongoing ﬁght against cyberattacks. 
2.3 Cyber Kill Chain 
The term “intrusion kill chain (IKC),” also known as “cyber kill chain (CKC)” 
[7], refers to the sequence of actions that an advanced persistent threat (APT) 
or cyberattacker usually follows to gain access to a target machine or network. 
By dividing the attack process into multiple distinct phases, the model aids 
organizations in comprehending and defending against cyberattacks. Figure 2.3 
shows an illustration of cyber kill chain phases, discussed below. 
Fig. 2.3 An illustration of cyber kill chain phases [ 8]
2.3 Cyber Kill Chain 29
2.3.1 Reconnaissance 
The cyber kill chain typically originates with this reconnaissance phase, where 
cyberattackers systematically collect critical information about their target. Identify-
ing potential vulnerabilities, an in-depth understanding of the target’s infrastructure, 
and pinpointing possible entry points are all included in this phase. Attackers gain critical information about the strengths and weaknesses of their target through a 
variety of methods like data mining, social engineering, and network scanning. This information then inﬂuences their attack plan for the future phases. Thus early detection and mitigation of reconnaissance operations is generally important to an 
effective defense against cyber threats. A strong security framework and increased user awareness are essential during this early stage of reconnaissance activity identiﬁcation and mitigation. 
2.3.2 W eaponization 
Cyber adversaries carefully prepare their collection of malicious resources during 
this weaponization phase of the cyber kill chain. This is the development or 
acquisition of malicious payloads, like as malware or weaponized documents, that are meticulously designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the target system. 
Weaponization serves as a crucial transitional phase, marking the shift from initial reconnaissance to active stages of attack. Attackers focus their efforts on creating advanced tools and strategies to get around security measures during this phase to 
successfully deliver their harmful payloads to the target. It emphasizes how crucial it is for businesses to put strong security measures into operation to detect and prevent dangerous payloads and reduce the likelihood that cyberattacks will be successful. 
2.3.3 Delivery 
Cyber adversaries execute their plan to deliver harmful payloads to the target system or network during this delivery phase of the cyber kill chain. Techniques 
like phishing emails, malicious attachments, compromised websites, or alternate delivery methods are commonly used in this phase. It serves as a crucial link between the target’s actual compromise and the earlier stages of weaponization and 
reconnaissance. Successful delivery tactics often rely on exploiting human factors, technical vulnerabilities, or social engineering to trick individuals within the target organization into opening or executing the malicious payload. Organizations need 
to step up their efforts in email ﬁltering, web security, and employee training to effectively counter these threats during this phase.
30 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
2.3.4 Exploitation 
Cyber adversaries take advantage of previously identiﬁed vulnerabilities or weak-
nesses within the target system in this exploitation phase in the cyber kill chain. 
They utilize a variety of strategies, including zero-day exploits, social engineering, 
and known software vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the target system. This stage is crucial to the attacker’s progress since it shows that they are actively 
breaking through the target’s defenses and taking control of the system. Proactive vulnerability management, timely patching, and security awareness training are essential for organizations to effectively counter exploitation efforts and prevent 
cyber adversaries from penetrating deeper into the network and compromising vital resources. 
2.3.5 Installation 
Once cyberattackers have successfully exploited vulnerabilities and gained early access to the target system, this installation phase of the cyber kill chain becomes a 
crucial stage where threats become persistent. Attackers usually install malware, backdoors, or other malicious components during this stage to ensure that they can continue to have access and control over the victim’s system. Their ability 
to persevere enables them to accomplish their malicious goals, such as obtaining sensitive information, manipulating systems, or gaining additional access. It is challenging to defend against the installation phase; therefore organizations need to 
concentrate on strong access controls, continuous monitoring, and threat detection techniques to identify and mitigate these persistent consequences. 
2.3.6 Command and Control 
Once cyberattackers have gained access to the target system, they create a covert communication channel during this command and control phase of the cyber kill chain. The purpose of this channel is to let attackers carry out their malicious 
objectives by executing commands, stealing data, and controlling the compromised environment. Attackers use a variety of strategies to hide their existence, which is often indicative of their concealing operations. Organizations must identify and 
block this channel to thwart the attacker’s progress, reduce possible damage, and prevent additional exploitation of their network and resources. Organizations need to set a high priority on effective network monitoring, anomaly detection, and rapid 
incident response to protect against the command-and-control phase.
2.4 MITRE ATT&CK 31
2.3.7 Actions on Objectives 
After a cyberattack has successfully progressed through the previous phases, the 
adversaries execute their ﬁnal goals during this actions on objectives phase of the 
cyber kill chain. A wide range of threatening operations, such as data exﬁltration, 
system modiﬁcation, information destruction, and other actions aimed at advancing 
the attacker’s objectives, might be included in this phase. This stage can have serious 
consequences, including ﬁnancial losses, operational disruptions, data breaches, and 
compromise to the targeted organization’s reputation. To minimize the effects of 
these sophisticated and frequently covert cyberattacks, effective defense against this 
phase necessitates a combination of robust security measures, incident response 
readiness, and proactive threat identiﬁcation. 
Based on our discussion above, we can conclude that organizations may better 
comprehend the tactics used by cybercriminals and create plans to detect, prevent, 
and resolve cyber threats at different stages of the attack life cycle by using 
this cyber kill chain framework. It may help organizations develop potential 
strategies to identify and prevent attacks at different stages of the kill chain by 
comprehending and mapping these steps. Organizations can also enhance their 
defenses against cyberattacks and mitigate the potential adverse effects of security 
incidents by detecting and preventing the attacker’s activities early in the chain. It 
also emphasizes the value of cybersecurity best practices and proactive defense, like 
patch management, network monitoring, and user education. 
2.4 MITRE A TT&CK 
The Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, known as “MITRE 
ATT&CK” [ 9], is typically a guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks 
and intrusions, which was created by the Mitre Corporation and released in 2013. 
These are deﬁned as below: 
• Tactics: This typically represents high-level objectives, i.e., the goal of an 
ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. For example, an attacker might want to 
control a network by gaining the credential access. 
• Techniques: This typically represents speciﬁc methods that are used to achieve 
those objectives, i.e., how an attacker achieves their tactical goal. For example, 
an attacker uses a credential dumping method to achieve the above goal. 
• Sub-techniques: This includes additional details or variations of the technique 
providing a more speciﬁc description of the behavior an adversary uses to 
achieve their goal. For example, an attacker might attempt to retrieve credential 
information from the Local Security Authority Subsystem or Active Directory 
database.
32 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
Overall, we can say that MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base that helps in 
simulating cyber adversaries’ tactics and techniques and then demonstrates how to 
detect and prevent them. It identiﬁes tactics that indicate an attack is in progress, 
rather than focusing on the results of an attack or an indicator of compromise 
(IoC). To better protect an organization and defend against cyber threats, ATT&CK 
amasses information that can assist in understanding how attackers behave or the 
tactics used by attackers. 
2.4.1 MITRE ATT&CK Matrices 
Although MITRE ATT&CK originally emphasizes threats against Windows enter-
prise systems, it now includes coverage for Linux, mobile, macOS, and ICS. Thus, 
MITRE ATT&CK organizes adversary tactics and techniques into matrices, each of 
which contains tactics and techniques related to attacks on particular domains. They 
are as follows: 
• Enterprise Matrix: The Enterprise Matrix is the core matrix that covers tactics 
and techniques for different platforms and operating systems within a traditional 
enterprise network. Thus Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud environments are 
included in this Enterprise Matrix. Each cell in the matrix represents a speciﬁc 
technique for a given tactic and platform. 
• Mobile Matrix: The Mobile Matrix emphasizes tactics and techniques relevant 
to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Thus, this matrix helps 
in understanding the speciﬁc threats and attack techniques targeting mobile 
platforms. 
• ICS Matrix: The ICX Matrix’s tactics and techniques for attack are directed 
toward the machinery, devices, sensors, and networks that are utilized to 
automate or control activities for industries, utilities, transportation systems, and 
other critical service providers. Security professionals and businesses operating 
in the industrial sector can beneﬁt from using this matrix to understand and 
resolve cybersecurity issues speciﬁc to ICS environments. 
2.4.2 MITRE ATT&CK T actics 
Each MITRE ATT&CK tactic represents a speciﬁc adversarial goal, which is close 
to the stages or phases of a cyberattack. Through the tactics, the attacker typically 
wants to accomplish their speciﬁc goal at a given time. For example, ATT&CK 
tactics covered by the Enterprise Matrix include [ 9]: 
• Reconnaissance: This includes gathering the necessary information to plan for 
an attack. 
• Resource development: This includes establishing relevant resources needed for 
an attack or to support attack operations.
2.4 MITRE ATT&CK 33
• Initial access: This includes penetrating the target network/system or gaining 
access to the victim’s network or systems. 
• Execution: This includes running malicious code or malware on the compro-
mised network or systems. 
• Persistence: This includes maintaining access in that compromised network or 
systems. 
• Privilege escalation: This includes attempting to gain higher-level privileges or 
access, e.g., moving from user to administrator-level access. 
• Defense evasion: This includes taking actions to avoid detection once inside a 
system. 
• Credential access: This includes attempting to steal usernames, passwords, and 
other login credentials. 
• Discovery: This includes gathering information about the compromised net-
work/systems or researching the target environment to learn what resources can 
be accessed or controlled to support a planned attack. 
• Lateral movement: This includes gaining access to additional resources or 
moving from one system to another within the compromised environment. 
• Collection: Gathering data related to the attack or to support the high-level attack 
goal. 
• Command and control: This includes establishing control over the victim’s 
network/systems and communicating with compromised network/systems from 
outside, i.e., enabling the attacker to control the system. 
• Exﬁltration: This includes stealing the data from the compromised system, i.e., 
the victim’s data. 
• Impact: This includes interrupting, damaging, corrupting, or destroying data 
or business processes, in other words, making networks/systems and data 
unavailable to the victim. 
The tactics and techniques may vary from matrix to matrix on particular domains. 
For example, the Mobile Matrix deﬁned earlier does not include Reconnaissance 
and Resource Development tactics but includes other tactics such as Network 
Effects and Remote Service Effects, which are not found in the Enterprise Matrix 
[9]. 
In summary, “MITRE ATT&CK” and the “cyber kill chain” are two frameworks 
commonly used in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity to understand, analyze, and respond 
to cyber threats. While the cyber kill chain focuses on the sequential stages of 
an attack and is often used for preventive measures, MITRE ATT&CK is a more 
comprehensive framework covering a broader range of tactics and techniques used 
by adversaries across different platforms. Another approach, Attack Trees, provide a 
structured way to analyze attack scenarios, can be used to security threat modeling, 
stemming from dependency analysis. Similar other frameworks in the area, for 
example, STRIDE (spooﬁng identity, tampering with data, repudiation, information 
disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege), a model of threats, can 
help reason and ﬁnd threats to a system, while DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, 
Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability), a risk assessment model, can be
34 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
used to evaluate and prioritize security vulnerabilities based on their potential 
impact [ 11]. Organizations can customize and leverage these frameworks together 
to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture according to their requirements and 
assets. 
2.5 Cybersecurity Life Cycle 
The cybersecurity life cycle, sometimes referred to as the cybersecurity framework 
or process, is a structured approach for managing and maintaining the cybersecurity 
controls within an organization. To safeguard their data, infrastructure, and informa-
tion systems from cyber threats and vulnerabilities, organizations typically conduct 
a cycle that consists of several stages or processes. Certain steps and stages may 
differ signiﬁcantly according to their unique objectives and requirements across 
sectors. According to NIST [ 10] a common representation of the cybersecurity 
frame work typically includes identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover phases. 
In addition to these ﬁve core functions, govern directs an understanding of organi-
zational context and how an organization will implement the other ﬁve functions, as 
shown in Fig. 2.4. In the following, we give an overview of these phases to enhance 
cybersecurity posture. 
Fig. 2.4 An illustration of 
NIST cybersecurity 
framework [ 10]

2.5 Cybersecurity Life Cycle 35
2.5.1 Govern 
This govern function is essential in developing and managing the organization’s 
approach, strategy, and policy for managing cybersecurity risk. It serves as a cross-
cutting function, providing perceptions to achieve and prioritize the goals of the 
remaining ﬁve functions in the context of the organization’s mission and stakeholder expectations. For cybersecurity to be seamlessly included in the organization’s 
overall enterprise risk management strategy, governance activities are essential. Govern includes crucial elements like establishing the organizational context; developing a cybersecurity strategy; managing supply chain cybersecurity risks; 
outlining roles, responsibilities, and authorities; establishing policies, processes, and procedures; and ensuring efﬁcient oversight of the cybersecurity strategy. 
2.5.2 Identify 
This part typically involves understanding and cataloging an organization’s digital assets, e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, and people, 
as well as assessing the risks associated with them. Thus businesses become familiar with their cybersecurity environment during the identify step. Identifying vulnerabilities, categorizing data, identifying compliance requirements, and even-
tually establishing a foundational level of security are all included in this phase. Organizations can set priorities for areas for improvement and invest resources strategically by having an in-depth understanding of their cybersecurity landscape. 
2.5.3 Protect 
This protect phase of cybersecurity management, which builds on the fundamental knowledge gained during the identify phase, is typically dedicated to the proactive 
strengthening of an organization’s security posture. In this stage, businesses care-fully implement a variety of security measures to protect their valuable assets. Thus implementing security technologies like ﬁrewalls, encryption techniques, and access 
controls and the development of comprehensive security policies are all included in this phase. The main goal is to build a strong and resilient defense against potential threats, effectively mitigating the potential attack surface and reducing risks to a 
manageable level. The conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of information are all preserved through the use of protection mechanisms that are tactically designed against unauthorized access.
36 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
2.5.4 Detect 
In reality, security incidents can occur despite the preventive measures. Detect 
usually enables the quick identiﬁcation and investigation of anomalies indications of 
compromise and other potentially harmful cybersecurity events that might indicate 
the occurrence of cybersecurity attacks and incidents. Thus, a strong cybersecurity 
strategy must include the detect phase, which concentrates on the implementation 
of monitoring and detection technologies to ﬁnd and analyze possible cybersecurity 
attacks and compromises. Advanced technologies like intrusion detection systems 
(IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools are frequently 
used in these systems. These tools are essential for assisting businesses in quickly 
identifying any suspicious or malicious activities in real time. 
2.5.5 Respond 
The response phase becomes the focus of cybersecurity activities once a security 
incident is detected. This stage involves developing and executing an effective 
incident response strategy that speciﬁes the precise steps to be followed to swiftly 
resolve and mitigate current issues. An effective security incident response is 
essential because this contributes not only to mitigating the consequences but also to 
avoiding further damage. Overall, this function’s outcomes include communication, 
reporting, incident management, analysis, and mitigation. Therefore, a strong and 
rapid response is critically important to preserve security resilience and business 
continuity. 
2.5.6 Recover 
Following a security event, the recovery phase assumes primary responsibility and 
focuses on the process of returning affected systems and services to their typical, 
operational state. Data restoration, system patching, and post-incident analysis are 
all included in this phase. In addition to ensuring business continuity, the goal 
is to gain insightful information from the incident, identify lessons learned, and 
pinpoint opportunities for improvement. It is essential to adopt a proactive learning 
and improvement approach to enhancing future security measures and boosting an 
organization’s overall cybersecurity resilience. Overall, this phase emphasizes the 
prompt return to regular activities to mitigate the adverse impacts of cybersecurity 
incidents and to enable effective communication during the recovery period. 
Figure 2.4 illustrates the mutual dependence of all the procedures covered above

data. 
2.6 Discussion and Lessons Learned 
We have explored the essentials of cybersecurity background knowledge in this chapter, focusing speciﬁcally on terminologies; attack frameworks, such as MITRE ATT&CK; the cyber kill chain; as well as cybersecurity life cycle. By exploring 
these topics comprehensively, we gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape 
of cybersecurity. This chapter established a solid foundation by exploring these fundamental cybersecurity terminologies, including cybersecurity and relevant 
emerging technologies associated with AI. For effective communication and col-
laboration among cybersecurity practitioners, this was critical. Deﬁning terms such as threat, vulnerability, risk, teaming, and relevant emerging technologies together 
laid the groundwork for effective communication in cybersecurity, which eventually 
provided a common knowledge and language within this context. Collaboration and information exchange across teams and organizations can be facilitated by a 
common language explored in this chapter. 
A discussion then shifted to attack frameworks such as cyber kill chain and 
MITRE 
ATT&CK, a robust knowledge base that identiﬁes the tactics and techniques 
used by cyber adversaries. A granular view of adversarial tactics and techniques is 
provided by MITRE’s ATT&CK framework. In our discussion, we also highlighted its role in threat intelligence, red teaming, and blue teaming, offering a solid 
foundation for enhancing cyber defense strategies. Cyber kill chains provide a 
roadmap for understanding and countering cyber threats with their seven stages, from reconnaissance to actions. A discussion of the kill chain highlighted the 
dynamic nature of cyber threats and the need for multilayered defenses. Our analysis 
highlighted the importance of disrupting attacks at various stages and implementing proactive measures to thwart adversaries before they accomplish their goals. A 
structured approach to managing and improving an organization’s cybersecurity 
posture was examined in the cybersecurity life cycle. The iterative nature of the process is highlighted in our discussion, emphasizing continuous monitoring, 
assessment, and adaptation to threats that change over time. 
A crucial lesson learned from the chapter is the imperative to integrate the 
acquired 
knowledge. Through the integration of terminologies, MITRE ATT&CK, 
the cyber kill chain, and the cybersecurity life cycle, we get a holistic view of 
cybersecurity. Combining terminologies, insights from ATT&CK, and the struc-tured approach of the kill chain and life cycle, cybersecurity professionals can create 
a comprehensive defense strategy. This combination allows for a more adaptive and 
agile response to threats as they evolve. By adopting the frameworks discussed, organizations can adopt a proactive defense approach. To reduce the likelihood 
of successful compromises, security teams can leverage MITRE ATT&CK and
