It is widely used for encryption in various protocols like Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) for wireless networks.
Key properties of RC4 are:

Symmetric: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
Variable key length: Supports variable key lengths.
Simple implementation: The algorithm is relatively simple to implement.
Fast: RC4 is fast and efficient in software, making it suitable for many applications.
Vulnerabilities: However, RC4 has vulnerabilities, such as biases in the initial keystream bytes, which led to its deprecation in modern cryptographic protocols.

Rivest Cipher 5
It was designed by Ron Rivest in 1994 and is a symmetric key block encryption algorithm. It operates on blocks of two words at a time. The parameters defining different instances of RC5 are denoted as RC5-w/r/b, where:

w represents the word size in bits
r indicates the number of rounds
b signifies the key size in bytes

These parameters allow for various configurations of RC5, enabling adaptability to different block sizes, round counts, and key lengths, thereby facilitating customization based on specific encryption requirements. Some of the advantages are:

Enhanced security: RC5 is engineered to offer robust protection against various attacks, including brute-force attacks and differential cryptanalysis. With its capability to employ variable-length keys and accommodate block sizes of up to 256-bits, RC5 presents formidable challenges to potential attackers, bolstering encryption security.
Rapid encryption and decryption: RC5 is renowned for its swift encryption and decryption processes. Using straightforward mathematical operations like modular arithmetic and bit shifting, RC5 efficiently executes modern CPUs and hardware, ensuring speedy data processing.
Versatile key length: RC5 boasts a flexible approach to key length, supporting a range from 0 to 2040-bits. This adaptability empowers users to tailor the key length according to their specific security requirements and available resources, enhancing overall encryption customization and efficacy.
