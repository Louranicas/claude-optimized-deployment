Cryptography incorporates many methods and strategies to safeguard sensitive data against unauthorized access or alteration. As an indispensable element of contemporary computing, cryptography finds application across various domains, including secure communication channels and online transactions. The field has evolved substantially, continuously adapting to emerging threats and technological advancements:

Figure 5.1: Cryptography
Core principles integral to modern cryptography include data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation and are defined as:

Confidentiality involves enforcing specific rules, typically established through confidentiality agreements, to restrict access to information to designated individuals or locations.
Data integrity ensures that data remains accurate and consistent throughout its entire lifecycle.
Authentication ensures information comes from trusted sources, preventing impersonation and identity fraud. Key techniques include authentication, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
Non-repudiation guarantees that an individual or party involved in a contract or communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message.

Some key concepts described in Figure 5.2 are essential to understanding cryptography:

Encryption: Encryption involves converting plain text into a coded form that only those with the proper key can decipher. Various encryption algorithms exist, each differing in complexity and effectiveness.
Decryption: Decryption reverses the encryption process, transforming coded messages into plain text. Only individuals possessing the decryption key can perform this operation.
Public key cryptography: Also known as asymmetric cryptography, public key cryptography utilizes two distinct keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Symmetric key cryptography: Symmetric key cryptography employs a single key for encryption and decryption. It is often employed when secure communication channels have been established between parties.
Hash functions: Hash functions generate unique digital fingerprints for messages, ensuring message integrity and detecting any unauthorized alterations.
Digital signatures: Digital signatures provide authentication and non-repudiation by combining a private key and a hash function to verify the sender's identity and message integrity, preventing denial of message origin or content alteration.

Cryptography plays a vital role in various aspects of modern communication, encompassing:

Securing online transactions: It encrypts sensitive data during online banking and e-commerce, safeguarding it from unauthorized access.
Digital signatures: These authenticate digital documents, ensuring their integrity and guarding against tampering.
Password protection: Cryptographic algorithms encrypt passwords, shielding them from theft or interception.
Military and intelligence applications: Employed extensively to safeguard classified information and communications.

Cryptography poses various challenges, such as:

Key management: Effective cryptographic communication relies on meticulous key management to uphold security.
Quantum computing: The emergence of quantum computing poses a potential threat to current cryptographic algorithms, potentially rendering them vulnerable to attacks.
Human error: Cryptographic security is only as robust as its weakest link, with human error being a significant vulnerability that can compromise communication integrity.

Three primary types of cryptography shown in Figure 5.3 include:

Symmetric key cryptography: In this method, the sender and recipient utilize the same shared key for encryption and decryption. While symmetric key systems offer speed and simplicity, they require a secure key exchange between parties. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) uses a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring both sender and receiver have the same key for secure communication. It is a widely used and trusted symmetric key encryption algorithm.
Hash functions: This algorithm operates without the use of a key. Instead, it transforms plain text into a fixed-length hash value, making it difficult to reverse-engineer the original information. Hash functions are extensively utilized in operating systems for password encryption purposes.
Asymmetric key cryptography: In this type, a pair of keys, namely public and private keys, is utilized for encryption and decryption. Public keys encrypt data, while private keys decrypt it. The public and private keys are distinct from each other. Even if the public key is widely known, only the designated recipient possesses the private key to decipher the message, ensuring secure communication.

Symmetric key encryption
Symmetric key cryptography is the most ancient and spontaneous method of cryptography. It ensures the confidentiality of information through symmetric key encryption, employing a single secret key for both encrypting and decrypting data. Symmetric encryption simplifies encryption by employing a single secret key for encrypting and decrypting electronic data, as depicted in Figure 5.
