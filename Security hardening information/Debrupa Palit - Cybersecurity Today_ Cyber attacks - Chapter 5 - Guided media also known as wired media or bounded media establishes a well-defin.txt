Chapter: 5 - Guided media, also known as wired media or bounded media, establishes a well-defined pathway for signal transmission. In guided media, transmission signals are controlled and confined within a fixed, narrow channel, typically facilitated by physically connected interfaces. The advantage of guided media is its rapid transmission velocity. Users opt for guided media over unguided alternatives due to factors such as enhanced transmission security and the ability to manage network traffic within a confined geographical area. Fiber optics, coaxial cable, optical fiber cable, and twisted pair cable are examples of guided media.
Unguided media, also known as wireless or unbounded transmission media, operates without physical links to network nodes or servers. Electromagnetic signal waves in unguided media are transmitted through the air over a broader geographic area, making them less secure. This medium is preferred in geographically challenging areas like hilly regions where installing cables is impractical or cost-prohibitive. Unguided media finds application in short-range communication tasks such as transferring data between cell phones, operating TV remotes, and exchanging data between devices within enclosed spaces like homes or offices. Radio waves, infrared, microwaves are examples of unguided media:

Network devices
The physical backbone of any network is formed by network devices, also known as networking hardware. They are tangible components enabling communication and interaction among hardware on a computer network. Examples include repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, gateways, and network interface cards (NICs). They facilitate the connection of computers, printers, fax machines, and various electronic devices to a network, ensuring the swift, secure, and accurate transfer of data across the same or different networks. Repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, gateways, NICs are some of the network devices. These key components are employed to facilitate efficient data transmission and connectivity and are described as:

A repeater is a two-port device that functions at the physical layer of a network. Its primary task is to regenerate signals within the same network, preventing them from becoming too weak or corrupted and thus extending the transmission range. They not only amplify signals but also regenerate them. When signals weaken, repeaters copy and regenerate them, ensuring that the strength remains consistent. They facilitate connections in star topology configurations while preserving the original signal strength.
A hub is a network device operating at the physical layer and it functions as a multi-port repeater, linking multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It lacks the ability to filter data and broadcast data to all connected devices.
Bridge operates at the data link layer, connecting two or more network segments and selectively forwarding data between them based on MAC addresses. Bridges do not involve IP addressing and are commonly used to extend networks while maintaining compatibility with existing hardware. Bridges enhance network efficiency by reducing unnecessary traffic propagation across segments.
A switch is a networking device that links various devices to ethernet networks via twisted pair cables, employing packet switching to efficiently handle incoming data packets. By maintaining a comprehensive list of network addresses for all connected devices, the switch ensures accurate packet delivery. Upon receiving a packet, it verifies the destination address and forwards the packet to the appropriate port after checking for collisions and other network anomalies. Data transmission occurs in full duplex mode, enhancing network efficiency and bandwidth utilization.
A router directs data packets according to their IP addresses and operates primarily at the network layer. It connects at least two LANs and the Internet Service Provider (ISP). It maintains dynamically updated routing tables to determine the routing of data packets. Additionally, routers amplify signals prior to transmission.
A gateway serves as a bridge between two networks operating on potentially different networking models, facilitating the exchange of data between them. Typically, a gateway comprises a computer with multiple NICs connecting it to various networks. It acts as intermediary agents as it receives data from one system, interprets it, and transmits it to another system. They are often referred to as protocol converters and can function at various network layers.
A NIC, also known as a network adapter, operates at both the physical and data link layers of the network model. It is responsible for the connection of a computer to a network, typically used to establish a LAN. It is installed within the computer, and features a unique identifier embedded on the chip and a connector for cable attachment. This cable serves as the interface linking the computer to the router.

Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS
Protocol is a set of rules for handling and structuring data. In a network, the computer may work on different software and hardware configurations. However, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each effectively other. These standardized rules facilitate seamless data exchange across diverse devices. Protocols ensure interoperability and efficient data transmission within networks.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP is a widely adopted application-level protocol utilized for exchanging files across the World Wide Web. HTTP operates on the top of the TCP/IP protocol suite, as shown in Figure 1.
