Bash Command-Line and  
Its Hacking Environment
In this foundational chapter, you will embark on your journey into the world of Bash shell scripting 
for penetration testers  (pentesters ). Y ou will gain a clear understanding of what Bash is, why it is 
essential for penetration testing  (pentesting ), and how to set up your scripting environment. Through 
hands-on examples and explanations, you will lay the groundwork for becoming a proficient Bash 
scripter in the context of cybersecurity.
Bash is more than just a command interpreter – it’s a tool for automating the complex and tedious 
tasks that we encounter daily in cybersecurity. In the hands of the untrained, Bash is a club. It seems 
heavy, overly complex, and uncomfortable. In the hands of those able to see the benefits and invest 
time in learning its intricacies, it’s a scalpel that you can use to slice through data with the skill of a 
surgeon and automate pentesting methodology like a robotics engineer.
In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:
• Introduction to Bash
• Lab setup
• Configuring your hacker shell
• Setting up essential pentesting tools
Technical requirements
To follow along with the exercises in this chapter, you’ll need a Linux environment. This book assumes 
you have enough skill to install an operating system and are familiar with installing and configuring 
virtual machine environments. If you need help setting up your lab environment, the VirtualBox 
online manual (Oracle VM VirtualBox User Manual, (https://download.virtualbox.
org/virtualbox/UserManual.pdf) and several Y ouTube videos (VirtualBox – Y ouTube 
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=virtualbox ) will be helpful.
Bash Command-Line and Its Hacking Environment 4
Fortunately, there are many ways to configure a Bash learning environment for free. All examples will 
be shown using Kali Linux. However, any Linux or macOS environment will work.
“Kali Linux is an open source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared toward various information 
security tasks, such as penetration testing, security research, computer forensics, and reverse engineering. ”  
(Kali Linux , https://www.kali.org/)
I strongly suggest that you use a fresh Kali Linux virtual machine to follow along with the exercises 
or when performing pentests. Throughout this book and your pentests, you will be installing a lot of 
tools and their dependencies. It’s common for tool dependencies to clash and create what is known 
as dependency hell . This could result in damage to your main system if you haven’t properly isolated 
the tools during installation. Y ou also don’t want to risk infecting your main system with malware.
Kali offers a wide variety of solutions. They provide installer images, virtual machines, cloud images, 
and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL ) packages.
Y ou can download Kali from https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms.
