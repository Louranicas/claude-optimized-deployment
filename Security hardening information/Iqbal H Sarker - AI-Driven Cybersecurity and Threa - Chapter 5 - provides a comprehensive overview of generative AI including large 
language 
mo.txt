# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Iqbal H. Sarker - AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence_ Cyber Automation, Intelligent Decision-Making and Explainability (2024, Springer) - libgen.li
Chapter: 5 - provides a comprehensive overview of generative AI including large 
language 
modeling (LLM) in the context of cybersecurity, highlighting its potential 
beneﬁts and challenges as well as techniques. A variety of machine and deep 
learning techniques including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (V AEs), and deep neural networks that can mimic and generate data 
are included in the ﬁeld of generative AI. In the realm of cybersecurity, generative 
AI plays a multifaceted role including the development of realistic honeypots, deceiving adversaries, producing simulated threat data for security system training, 
and enhancing anomaly detection capabilities. This chapter further explores the 
challenges and opportunities for generative AI, emphasizing the potential for enhanced threat mitigation and resilience in a constantly evolving cyber threat 
environment.
