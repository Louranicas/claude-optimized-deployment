Chapter: 2 - AI research in China 
Artificial intelligence research in China began in the late 1960s [XIN 83].  
According to Wang Jieshu’s analysis [JIE 18], the history of Chinese AI is 
closely linked to the history of the Soviet Union and the close relationship 
between the two countries. In the period 1970–1983, the main areas of 
research covered a broad spectrum of issues, such as: 
– machine translation, a field whic h, in 1982, includes some of the 
following achievements: 
- development of ECTA (English–Chinese Automatic Translation 
System) software, 
- development of the English–Chinese Title Translation System, 
- JF-111, A Universal Machine Translation System; 
– natural language understanding; 
– theorem proving; 
– expert systems;  
– robotics.  
Nothing in this enumeration really  distinguishes the orientation of 
Chinese research from its Western counterpa rts. Again, the approach here is 
multidisciplinary (mathematics, computer science, linguistics, medicine, 
automation, robotics, aeronautics, etc.).  
In the 1980s, China already had a large number of publications, 
achievements, researchers and universities involved in AI research. Jieshu’s 
article only mentions civil applications , nothing is said about the military’s 
position on this research topic and its investment in universities.
