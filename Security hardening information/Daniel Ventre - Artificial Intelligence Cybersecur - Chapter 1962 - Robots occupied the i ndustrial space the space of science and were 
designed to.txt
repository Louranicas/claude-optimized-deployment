Chapter: 1962 - Robots occupied the i ndustrial space, the space of science and were 
designed to assist humanity in their experiments, and to confront hostile 
environments. In 1994, the Robotics Ins titute at Carnegie Mellon University 
designed the eight-legged robot DANTE II, which explored the crater of the 
Spurr volcano. Its shape was inspired  by the shape of a spider. This 
achievement combined sensor technology , computer science,  electronics and 
communication instruments.  
Robotics, a scientific discipline, came about either in 1956 or 1964: 
– 1956, when George Devol and Jo e Engelberger met. From their 
collaboration, the robotics industry, a magazine ( Industrial Robot ) and an 
international conference ( International Symposium on Industrial Robotics )

were born. Joe Engelberger is sometimes referred to as the “father of 
robotics”; 
– 1964, when Bernie Roth, a mechanical  engineer, met AI researcher John 
McCarthy. This was the starting point for a fruitful collaboration, scientific 
publications, developments and regular scientific meetings that gradually 
solidified a new research community. 
A third option of the date of the creation of this discipline dates back to 
telerobotics (developed in the 1940s in the United States to manipulate 
nuclear materials). Goertz’s articles in  1952 and 1954 were the starting point 
for the history of robotics25.  
Whatever the precise date chosen, the birth of robotics is, generally, 
contemporary to that of AI (1950s).  
Robotics, as a discipline, has rubbed elbows with AI since its origins, but 
it has developed as a discipline in its own right: 
“[…] the scientific task of understanding intelligence is already 
well under way in artificial intelligence, a subpart of computer 
science. If an appropriate direct scientific field already exists, 
why is robotics needed in a ddition? Why isn’t artificial 
intelligence the supplier of basic scientific capital to robotics, 
along with other suppliers, such as computer science, 
mechanical engineering and electrical engineering?  
There is an answer and it further illuminates my basic thesis. 
Artificial intelligence currently shares with computer science a 
special view – it considers information processing divorced 
from energetics. This creation of an interior milieu, in which 
only information processes occur, is a powerful abstraction, one 
which helped computer science to emerge by permitting it to 
focus on the essential mechanis ms. But the costs of the 
abstraction show nowhere more clearly than in the unexplored 
central problem of robotics – controlled perceptually 
coordinated motion.” [NEW 81]

The work of the Stanford  AI Research Center in the 1970s integrated 
R&D in robotics: 
“We are pursuing fundamental studi es in several areas: problem 
solving, perception, automated mathematics, and learning. 
However, we find it productive to choose as a goal the creation of 
a single integrated system […] Our system consists of a mobile 
robot vehicle controlled by radio from a large digital computer. 
The principal goal is to develop software for the computer that, 
when used in conjunction with the hardware of the vehicle, will 
produce a system capable of inte lligent behavior […] Before we 
changed computers (at the end of 1969), our robot system had 
achieved a primitive level of capabilities: It could analyze a 
simple scene in a restricted laboratory environment; plan solutions 
to certain problems, provided that exactly the correct data were 
appropriately encoded; and carry out its plans, provided nothing 
went wrong during execution. Therefore, when we began 
planning a new software system for controlling the robot from a 
new computer, we set more difficu lt short term goals: The system 
is to be able to operate in a larger environment, consisting of 
several rooms, corridors, and doorw ays; its planning ability must 
be able to select relevant data fr om a large store of facts about the 
world and the robot’s capabilities; and it must be able to recover 
gracefully from certain unexpected failures or accumulated errors. 
We have not yet accomplished these goals.” [RAP 71] 
Like AI, robotics was built around an American center. However, robotics 
and robots have met with great succes s in many other countries, including 
Japan, a country that is particularly ac tive in research and development in the 
field: in 1997, the first robot tourname nt in Japan (RoboCup) took place; in 
1999, Sony presented and marketed AIBO, the first pet robot-dog; in 2000, 
Honda created the humanoid robot AS IMO. Japan has been particularly 
involved in robotics and has been a worl d leader in recent decades, ahead of 
the United States and other industrialized nations. In 2010, Japan accounted 
for two-thirds of the world’s robot produ ction (although not a ll of this robotics 
is AI-related). This success is largely due to the fact that Japan has, on its 
territory, all the technological and i ndustrial skills and building blocks 
necessary for robotics (without being a lead er in all of these fields: mechanics, 
electronics, computing, sensors, etc. ) [NAR 10]. The efforts made in 
robotization can also be explained by sp ecific societal needs: a lack of

manpower and an aging population that no immigration can compensate for. It 
is therefore necessary to replace humans  by machines in production, and to 
think about solutions to support elderly populations. Robotics is not a priority 
issue for national defense, especially as, since the end of World War II, the 
country no longer has the right to have its own army. Investments are therefore 
oriented in fields other than defense.  
Robots are machines (AI is software): 
– that are programmed; 
– that perform tasks independently or semi-autonomously; 
– that interact with their physi cal environment through sensors.  
Some robots are also machines that are controlled by operators (so there 
is no question in their case of autonomy). The “non-intelligent” robot, as 
opposed to the robot that is intelligent, is only capable of repetitive tasks: 
taking and moving an object. For this action, it does not need human 
intervention, so it is, in a way, “autonomous”, but it is difficult to qualify it as 
“smart”. Autonomy is therefore not sy nonymous with intelligence. However, 
this robot, which only repeatedly places objects, becomes “smart” when a 
camera is attached to it, which allows it to distinguish objects, differentiate 
them and assign a different action according to the type of object. Vision and 
perception require AI algorithms [OWE 17]. Intelligent robots are robots that 
have embedded AI programs.
