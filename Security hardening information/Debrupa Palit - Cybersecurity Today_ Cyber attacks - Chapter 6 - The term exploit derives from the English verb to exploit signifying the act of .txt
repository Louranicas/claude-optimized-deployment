Chapter: 6 - The term exploit derives from the English verb to exploit, signifying the act of utilizing something for personal advantage. In an attack scenario, the target system exhibits a design flaw that enables the creation of tools to access and manipulate it for the attacker’s benefit. In certain situations, an exploit can serve as a component within a multi-stage attack strategy. Rather than directly deploying a malicious file, the exploit might facilitate the installation of additional malware, such as backdoor spyware and Trojans. These types of backdoor malware are commonly employed to pilfer user data from compromised systems. Exploits can be categorized into various broad groups based on the vulnerabilities they exploit and their methods of operation. Here are some common classifications:

The term exploit derives from the English verb to exploit, signifying the act of utilizing something for personal advantage. In an attack scenario, the target system exhibits a design flaw that enables the creation of tools to access and manipulate it for the attacker’s benefit. In certain situations, an exploit can serve as a component within a multi-stage attack strategy. Rather than directly deploying a malicious file, the exploit might facilitate the installation of additional malware, such as backdoor spyware and Trojans. These types of backdoor malware are commonly employed to pilfer user data from compromised systems. Exploits can be categorized into various broad groups based on the vulnerabilities they exploit and their methods of operation. Here are some common classifications:

Network exploits: These exploits target weaknesses in network protocols, services, or devices.
Web application exploits: These exploits focus on vulnerabilities present in web applications, including XSS, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks.
Operating system exploits: These exploits leverage vulnerabilities within operating systems to gain unauthorized access, elevate privileges, or execute arbitrary code.
Application exploits: These exploits target vulnerabilities within specific software applications, such as office suites, media players, web browsers, or content management systems.
Social engineering exploits: These exploits manipulate human psychology to illicitly access systems or obtain confidential information.
Physical exploits: These exploits require physical access to systems or devices and may involve tactics like hardware keyloggers, USB-based attacks, or tampering with hardware/firmware.
Wireless exploits: These exploits focus on vulnerabilities found in wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Cryptographic exploits: These exploits center on weaknesses or vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms, protocols, or implementations. Refer to the following figure:

Vulnerability
A vulnerability represents a flaw or weakness present in an application, system, process, or individual which could be exploited by an attacker. If exploited, these vulnerabilities can result in significant negative impacts on an organization, its employees, and its customers. While vulnerabilities pose potential risks, they do not inherently pose a threat to an organization on their own. The true problem arises when vulnerabilities are exploited. This exploitation may occur intentionally by malicious actors or unintentionally by legitimate users. For instance, a buffer overflow vulnerability leading to a DoS attack could even be triggered by a cat walking across a user’s keyboard.
A cybersecurity vulnerability refers to any potential weakness that can be exploited to compromise the digital security of an organization. For example, the absence of a lock on the front door of a building represents a security vulnerability, as it allows unauthorized access for theft. Similarly, inadequate firewall protection exposes digital assets to intrusion, enabling unauthorized access to networks and valuable data. In essence, lacking proper firewalls constitutes a cybersecurity vulnerability due to the digital nature of the assets at risk. Identified security vulnerabilities include weaknesses such as flaws in the source code, misconfigurations in system components, trust configuration issues, ineffective credentialing practices, absence of robust encryption, insider threats, psychological vulnerabilities, insufficient authentication measures, injection flaws, exposure of sensitive data, inadequate monitoring and logging, and vulnerabilities associated with shared tenancy, as shown in Figure 2.7:

Cyber threat
A cyber threat, also referred to as a cybersecurity threat, constitutes a malicious act aimed at damaging data, stealing information, or causing disruption to digital environments. A cyber threat denotes a deliberate action aimed at unlawfully acquiring or tampering with data, or destabilizing the digital integrity of an organization. These threats encompass various forms of attacks, such as data breaches, computer viruses, DoS assaults, and other methods.
Cyber threats encompass potential cyber attacks targeting unauthorized access, disruption, theft, or damage to IT assets, IP, computer networks, or sensitive data. These threats may originate from trusted insiders within an organization or external entities from remote locations.
A threat comprises three main elements:

A cyber threat involves actions intended to undermine the security of an information system by compromising its availability, integrity, or confidentiality.
Cyber threat actors include states, groups, or individuals who exploit vulnerabilities, low cybersecurity awareness, and technological advancements with malicious intent. Their goal is to gain unauthorized access to information systems, potentially impacting victims’ data, devices, systems, and networks.
The cyber threat environment denotes the digital space where cyber threat actors engage in malicious activities.

Several common origins of cyber threats against organizations include:

Nation states: Hostile countries may launch cyber attacks against local businesses and institutions with the intent to disrupt communications, sow chaos, and cause harm.
Terrorist organizations: Terrorist groups engage in cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure, posing threats to national security, disrupting economies, and endangering citizens.
Criminal groups: Organized hacker collectives aim to infiltrate computer systems for financial gain. They utilize tactics such as phishing, spam, spyware, and malware to extort, steal private information, and perpetrate online scams.
Hackers: Individual hackers target organizations employing diverse attack methods. Motivated by personal gain, retaliation, financial incentives, or political agendas, they continually innovate new threats to enhance their criminal capabilities and status within the hacker community.
Malicious insiders: Employees with legitimate access to company resources may misuse their privileges to steal data or sabotage systems for personal or economic motives. Insiders can include employees, contractors, suppliers, or partners of the targeted organization, as well as external actors who compromise privileged accounts for impersonation.

Types of cybersecurity threats
The primary categories of threats to information security are as follows:

Malware attacks: These attacks employ various tactics to introduce malware onto a user's device, with social engineering being the most common method. Users may be prompted to perform actions like clicking on links or opening attachments. Alternatively, malware exploits vulnerabilities in browsers or operating systems to install itself surreptitiously without user awareness or consent. Once installed, malware can monitor user activities, transmit sensitive data to the attacker, aid in infiltrating other targets within the network, and even enlist the user's device into a botnet for malicious purposes.
Social engineering attacks: Social engineering attacks manipulate users into fulfilling the attacker's objectives or revealing sensitive information through psychological tactics. This involves exploiting human psychology to deceive individuals into taking actions that benefit the attacker. The goal is to exploit trust, curiosity, fear, or other emotions to gain unauthorized access or extract confidential data.
Software supply chain attacks: Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging sensitive information. Tactics include phishing emails, malvertising, drive-by downloads, scareware, vishing, whaling, pretexting, diversion theft, honey traps, tailgating, and pharming. These tactics prey on trust, curiosity, fear, or other emotions to deceive targets and achieve the attacker's objectives.
APT: When an unauthorized individual or group infiltrates a network undetected, they can exploit this access to exfiltrate sensitive data, evading detection by the organization's security measures. APTs require sophisticated attackers and often target nation states, large corporations, or other high-value entities due to the substantial effort involved. Indicators of APT presence include the creation of new accounts with elevated privileges, abnormal activity patterns on legitimate user accounts, the deployment of backdoor or Trojan horse malware for long-term access, unusual database activity such as sudden spikes in operations, and the presence of anomalous data files suggestive of data bundling for exfiltration purposes.
DDoS: DDoS attacks aim to incapacitate a target system by overwhelming its resources, rendering it inaccessible to users. Unlike traditional DoS attacks, DDoS involves a coordinated effort using numerous compromised computers or devices, known as botnets. These attacks often serve as diversions, distracting security personnel, while more insidious actions, such as data theft, occur simultaneously. DDoS methods include the utilization of botnets, Smurf attacks employing spoofed IP addresses to flood the victim with ICMP requests, and TCP SYN flood attacks that inundate the target with connection requests, causing legitimate connections to time out.
Man-in-the-middle attack (MitM): In a MitM attack, attackers disrupt the presumed direct communication between users or devices and a remote system, inserting themselves as intermediaries. By intercepting communications, attackers can potentially compromise user credentials, pilfer sensitive data, or manipulate responses. MitM attack variants include session hijacking, where attackers impersonate clients by substituting their IP address; replay attacks, which involve replaying intercepted messages to masquerade as the user; and IP spoofing, where attackers deceive systems into granting access by forging IP source addresses. Eavesdropping attacks exploit insecure network communications, while Bluetooth attacks target open Bluetooth connections, often to harvest credentials or personal information.
Password attacks: Hackers employ various methods to access individuals' password information, including sniffing network connections, social engineering, guessing, or infiltrating password databases. They may systematically guess passwords using software, leveraging logic related to individuals' names, occupations, or personal connections. Another tactic involves dictionary attacks, where common passwords are matched against encrypted files to gain access to victims' computers and networks. Pass-the-hash attacks exploit authentication protocols to capture password hashes and gain lateral access to networked systems without decrypting the hash. Similarly, golden ticket attacks begin with stolen password hashes, used to forge ticket-granting-ticket hashes on Kerberos systems, often facilitated by tools like Mimikatz.

In Figure 2.8, various types of cybersecurity threats are depicted. These threats pose significant risks to system security and integrity, requiring vigilant defense measures to mitigate their impact:
