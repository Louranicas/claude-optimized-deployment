On the other hand, the edge nodes are recreated by using emulation techniques that rely on the OpenStack and Chef virtualization technologies.
11.3.1.5 SPIDERSPIDER is a cyber range dedicated to cybersecurity training in relation with 5G networks [41]. To achieve this, the training environment replicates a custom 5G network that emulates a realistic 5G infrastructure. The infrastructure for SPIDER is represented by two 5G testbeds, namely MATILDA and Mouseworld. Both testbeds rely on the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) open-source network function virtualization management and orchestration software stack named MANO to provide 5G network emulation functionality. The key features of SPIDER are as follows:Emulation scenario definition: Configure the assets in the 5G environments, including any possible vulnerabilities.Management and orchestration: Coordinate the 5G network slices and the deployment of vertical applications in the network.Tracing and progress tracking: Use log extraction agents, aggregators, and an indexing engine to gather all the relevant information regarding training activities.Cyber risk assessment engine: Track cyber risk evolution in real time during the training in function of the occurring attacks and mitigation deployments.Training scenario orchestration: Manage the execution of the training scenarios, such as crypto mining malware detection, and DNS attack.Synthetic attack generation: Use machine learning techniques to generate synthetic network traffic that mimics both cyberattack and normal traffic to create realistic training conditions.
By using the features described above, SPIDER makes it possible to conduct various types of activities, such as cybersecurity risk assessment of 5G networks, and cybersecurity training for defending 5G networks from cyberattacks. This type of hands-on exercises in which participants are able to interact in real time with the 5G environment and gather feedback from the emulated network equipment enables them to develop advanced procedures for defending 5G networks from cyberattacks.

11.3.2 ICS/SCADA Cyber RangesIndustrial Control Systems (ICSs) are conceptually similar to IoT devices and networks. However, the industrial setting of ICS can be said to cause an increase in the risks associated to them, given the potential huge consequences and disruptions that attacks on ICS can cause. One type of ICS that is often used in practice is Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), a standardized control system architecture utilized for large industrial systems. Cybersecurity training in relation with ICS in general and SCADA in particular are very important given the related risks. In what follows, we will review several examples in this context.11.3.2.1 ICS NetWarsOne representative ICS cyber range is ICS NetWars by SANS Institute [43]. This cyber range is focused on factory machinery operations, and it recreates an experience similar to a factory floor. In ICS NetWars, trainees are exposed to challenges related to the defense of physical equipment and manufacturing components from cyberattacks. Example training topics include asset discovery and infrastructure mapping, detection of ICS-specific malware, endpoint forensics, process restoration, and use of engineering applications.
11.3.2.2 ICSCoEThe Industrial Cyber Security Center of Excellence (ICSCoE) is a center managed by the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) in Japan [25]. ICSCoE was established in 2017 with the purpose of development of human resources, systems, as well as technologies aimed at dealing with cybersecurity risks in regard to industrial infrastructure.Since human resource development is a key part of the program, the activities of the center consist of exercises in environments that reproduce real plants, including practical attack-defense training. In particular, trainees utilize realistic process control networks to gain firsthand experience of the effects of cyberattacks on Industrial Control Systems and devices. Thus, they become familiar with architectures of control systems, ICS security vulnerabilities, and mitigation measures specific to ICS.
11.3.2.3 KYPO4INDUSTRYKYPO4INDUSTRY is a training facility dedicated to teaching ICS security concepts and skills [9]. The training environment is built using open-source hardware and software that are leveraged to provide reconfigurable ICS modules. The components of the training platform include Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), input/output modules, a touchscreen display, a linear motor actuator, as well as a communication gateway.The associated course is based on the flipped-classroom format, in which participants work on hands-on projects that replicate real cyberattacks on ICS in the form of educational games. This experience makes it possible for trainees to understand the ICS-specific risks and to gain practical skills regarding mitigation techniques for cyberattacks that target ICS.
11.3.2.4 Other ICS/SCADA Capable Cyber RangesIn addition to the examples we have mentioned so far, the following general cyber ranges that we discussed in Sect. 11.2 also provide ICS and/or SCADA-related training functionality in addition to general cybersecurity training:Government cyber rangesAIT Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.1.1).CRATE Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.1.4).Florida Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.1.5).
Private-sector cyber rangesATCorp CYRIN (see Sect. 11.2.2.2).Cyberbit Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.2.4).RHEA Next-Generation Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.2.11).

The fact that both government and private-sector cyber ranges have dedicated training capabilities for this domain demonstrates that ICS/SCADA-related cybersecurity training is indeed of high importance.

11.3.3 Critical Infrastructure Cyber RangesCritical infrastructure refers to that infrastructure of a country that is considered essential for the functioning of the society. Consequently, governments put in place special strategies and protection measures regarding such infrastructure, including against cyberattacks. Cybersecurity training with respect to critical infrastructures is one key component of these strategies.One of the most important types of critical infrastructure is the power grid. While the power grid itself is associated already with a series of specific cybersecurity risks, the enhancements related to smart grid technologies, that include both flows of electricity and information, lead to an even greater attack surface, as it was discussed in detail in [35]. Consequently, in what follows we will provide several examples of power grid related cyber ranges, followed by a more generic one.11.3.3.1 GRID NetWarsOne cyber range that addresses power grid cybersecurity training needs is GRID NetWars, which is made available by SANS Institute [43]. In particular, this cyber range targets technologies used in electrical generation and distribution systems. Accordingly, the challenges included in the training are themed around power system scenarios, protocols, and architectures, but the skills gained are said to be applicable to other critical infrastructure sectors too. Some of the training topics covered in this program are stages of ICS cyberattacks, credential theft, process manipulation, cyberattack effects on reliability and system integrity, etc.
11.3.3.2 GridAttackSimAs discussed for other cyber ranges in the IoT domain, leveraging simulation techniques can help with creating cybersecurity training environments that, despite a certain loss in realism, are nevertheless very useful for improving cybersecurity skills. This also applies to the critical infrastructure sector, since conducting training on real critical infrastructure limits the scope of the training scenarios and is dangerous in case any mistakes are made.One system that leverages simulation is GridAttackSim, which is a smart grid attack co-simulation framework [31]. GridAttackSim is implemented by combining the functionality of Framework for Network Co-Simulation (FNCS), with that of the GridLAB-D power distribution simulator, and the Ns-3 network simulator to make it possible to simulate smart grid infrastructure.The framework includes a set of built-in attack profiles that make it possible to conduct experiments in a variety of scenarios and visualize the consequences of the cyberattacks. GridAttackSim is open source, which means that in addition to deploying it freely, users can also add by themselves custom attack profiles and smart grid architectures in order to explore new scenarios and conditions.We note that using analytical modeling is an approach that makes it possible to quantify the effects of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure at a much lower cost than using a cyber range, even though it is an even more abstract model of reality compared to simulation. Thus, the analytical modeling approach was used in the context of smart grids by GridAttackAnalyzer, a cyberattack analysis framework that uses graph-based security modeling techniques for the numerical analysis of smart grid cyberattacks [32]. For a comparison of the simulation and analytical modeling approaches used by the two systems discussed here, see [33].
11.3.3.3 Soteria ARENASoteria ARENA is a cybersecurity training platform for SCADA and IoT-operated Industrial Control Systems [46]. However, the training scenarios disclosed online refer not to general factory operation, but to critical infrastructure components, such as water plants and power plants. Therefore, we decided to include this cyber range in the critical infrastructure category. In fact, other elements are also present in the training scenarios, such as streetlights and airport infrastructure, differentiating it even more from the typical industrial settings of ICS/SCADA.The training activities used in ARENA are based on real-world threats regarding critical infrastructure and use as training environment models of the target systems. Participants conduct hands-on exercises with those emulated systems, for example, to perform penetration testing attacks intended to disturb their operation.A key characteristic of ARENA is that the training platform allows participants to see the physical impact of their actions for a better understanding of ICS and their vulnerabilities to cyber and physical threats. Thus, in addition to the simulation models, miniature physical models are also available for some of the exercises, which provide immediate feedback to participants. This aspect of ARENA makes it possible to conduct realistic training both for attack and defense techniques.
11.3.3.4 Other Critical Infrastructure Cyber RangesNote that the following general cyber ranges that we have discussed previously also provide critical infrastructure-related training functionality in addition to their main cybersecurity training capabilities:Government cyber rangesAIT Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.1.1).CRATE Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.1.4).
Private-sector cyber rangesCyberbit Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.2.4).RHEA Next-Generation Cyber Range (see Sect. 11.2.2.11).

The critical infrastructure sector that most of the above cyber ranges cover is the one that we mainly discussed in this section, namely the power grid. This signifies that energy production and distribution are arguably considered the most important domain by all critical infrastructure training providers. Other sectors covered by the mentioned cyber ranges include power plants (e.g., oil, gas, nuclear), water treatment plants, the railroad system, as well as heavy industry facilities.

11.3.4 IoMT and Healthcare Cyber RangesThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), also known as healthcare IoT, refers to those medical devices and applications that are connected to healthcare systems via computer networks, for instance, by using technologies such as Wi-Fi. Given the sensitive area of IoMT applications, security threats must necessarily be considered. Moreover, the quantitative study presented in [18] has demonstrated that there are many vulnerabilities related to IoMT devices that are rated as high or critical from the point of view of the security risk associated to them. For this reason, in what follows we will discuss several cyber ranges in the healthcare domain.11.3.4.1 Healthcare Cyber RangeHealthcare Cyber Range (HCCR) is a project that extended the functionality of the JYVSECTEC RGCE cyber range discussed in Sect. 11.2.2.7 to the healthcare domain by adding support for healthcare systems and processes [27]. HCCR aims to increase the resilience of healthcare actors regarding cybersecurity issues and to ensure patient safety in the context of digital healthcare through a range of specific cybersecurity education and training activities:Developing and testing cybersecurity exercises for the healthcare domain.Identifying specific cybersecurity skills for healthcare actors.Developing cybersecurity processes for the healthcare domain according to its specific requirements.
The training activities in the HCCR environment contribute to the improvement of cybersecurity skills and competence of healthcare actors in order to meet the stringent requirements of the healthcare domain. For this purpose, HCCR includes the following components that model virtual hospitals and equipment, social and health information systems, as well as national services:Patient information systems: Various aspects, such as medical records, prescriptions, laboratory results are modeled.Patient records: Realistic information regarding elements such as personal data, disease classifications, drug pack sizes, and reference values are provided.Intensive care unit: A physical patient simulator as well as medical equipment (a ventilator and a patient monitor) is included in addition to virtual systems.Integrated national services: Models of Finnish national healthcare services, pharmacies, and prescription centers are available, along with an authentication service.

11.3.4.2 Healthcare NetWarsAnother example in this category of cyber ranges is Healthcare NetWars, provided by SANS Institute [43]. This cyber range is used for training related to techniques for securing technologies and systems in the medical field. For this purpose, participants must solve tasks related to device vulnerability scanning, web application assessments, and ransomware threat response. The training topics include telemedicine and web application security, Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and incident analysis, medical device IoT security, and ransomware analysis and decryption.

11.3.5 Specialized Range ComparisonIn this section, we will compare the main characteristics of the specialized cyber ranges that we discussed so far, for which an overview is provided in Table 11.
