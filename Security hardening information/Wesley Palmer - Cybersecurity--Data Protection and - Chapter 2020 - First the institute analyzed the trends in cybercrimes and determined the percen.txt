Chapter: 2020 - First, the institute analyzed the trends in cybercrimes and determined the percentage increase in cyberattacks over the past five years. Additionally, the institute broke down the costs incurred by businesses because of cybercrimes. The analysis is done by industry and countries. Further, the institute provided detailed costs of some organizations impacted by cybercrimes. Further insights, information, and reports are available on the institute’s website.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies and McAfee reported that businesses worldwide lost up to $608 billion in 2017 due to cybercrimes. This is a $163 billion increase from 2014. Some reasons for this increase include new technologies used by cybercriminals, the proliferation of online transactions, and an increase in internet users in countries with weak cybersecurity systems.
Small Business Enterprises (SMEs)
Cybercriminals have realized that they could gain significant ground if they target small business enterprises (SMEs). Many SMEs do not have adequate resources to invest in sophisticated cybersecurity systems; yet, many SMEs have tremendous responsibilities because they have sensitive customer and employee information in their custody. SMEs handle many credit card transactions, which gives them access to customer addresses and phone number information for contact. SMEs are conduits to larger companies’ data systems. It was reported that the massive 2013 target data breach began with their HVAC vendor. Hackers have realized that they could infiltrate larger organizations through their small affiliates.
Department of Homeland Cybersecurity
The Department of Homeland Security provided a valuable informational guide on its website by listing many tips that could protect internet users’ personal data. Also, Homeland Security suggested firewall software that could be used to counter cyberattacks by cybercriminals. Homeland Security advised internet users to use strong passwords, which consist of multiple characters, to make it harder for hackers to attempt to log in to private users’ accounts.
Cyber Risks to Organizations’ Computer Network Infrastructure
Computer infrastructure includes network systems, software, and hardware that are used to process data and information. Vulnerability in computer infrastructure systems may provide opportunities for cybercriminals. This chapter analyzes and identifies these risks to help businesses take a more informed approach to cyberattack preventative measures.
Online Users’ Limitations
The internet has become an essential tool in modern life and plays a role in almost every task, big and small. The internet is used for sending documents, transmitting messages, financial banking, telecommunication, mobile networks, buying groceries, job interviews, teaching, counseling, and doctor visits. Although the internet is widely used, many users do not know enough about online risks. Internet scammers use emails, advertisements, pop-up notifications, and websites to steal personal information from unsuspecting users. Phishers send online users offers, surveys, unexpected attachments, and pop-up screen notifications telling users that they have won special prizes. They must click the link provided and follow the instructions to claim their prize. These scams appear very authentic and have deceived many unsuspecting users. Some internet scam links will direct users to websites that tell them their computers have been infected with a computer virus. To scan and remove the virus, the user must contact technical support with the provided phone number or email. Cyberthieves provide users with contact information that appears like the user’s computer customer care contact. Once the users contact the phone number or email, the cybercriminal will fully control their computer’s systems.
Cybercriminals use the same technique used by legitimate technical support personnel to control the function of the unsuspecting user’s computer so that the users will think that the technical support service is helping them from the place of purchase. In these cases, cybercriminals will ask the customer standard business questions to provide personal information. Cybercriminals conduct themselves professionally, so the users think their computers are being fixed. Cybercriminals use the appearance of a legitimate website to deceive their victims. In addition, they create fake URLs that look similar to legitimate websites and manipulate internet users to share their personal information on the website by making lucrative offers. The website’s physical appearance appears legitimate and thus difficult to detect. The lack of knowledge of internet scams and illegitimate techniques is responsible for escalating online fraud.
One of the ways to prevent internet scams is to verify the authenticity of every online offer. Internet users should pay special attention to the host providers of unsolicited offers. You should not click on the links attached to the offer if you cannot verify the hosting provider. For example, suppose you got an invitation for an offer from a well-known company. In that case, you should check the official web page of that company and make a telephone call before opening the offer online and exposing your computer system. Generally, the official web page will provide information about offers made to customers. Before you share your sensitive data on any soliciting websites, you should check the URLs of the website to verify authenticity. Usually, cyberscammers’ websites are coded differently from authentic websites.
Software and filters can help secure your device from viruses and cyberscammers. For example, suppose you got a notification that you have viruses on your computer. In that case, you should take your computer to the computer repair center in your community or call the customer care center for your computer dealership. If you received an unexpected call or email that says that you have won something (money, a trip, or electronic gadgets), and you never participated in any contest for the prize, this could be a cyberscam.
When you identify a cyberscam, you should report the incident to take action against the cybercriminal strategy. Cyberscams can be minimized, in many cases, if users take precautions and view every weblink with suspicion. Once you recognize a cyberscam, you should report it immediately to prevent other users from becoming victims. If you unknowingly provided your passwords, account numbers, contact information, and pins to internet phishers, you should contact the companies that you have your accounts with and let them know about it immediately. Changing your password and login will secure your account and reduce damaging risks. Changing and choosing complex passwords are the keys to preventing online scams.

Summary
Internet scams will always exist. However, if internet users are vigilant, they will reduce the ability of cybercriminals to steal personal data. By implementing cybersecurity measures to detect cyberscams and network intrusions, internet users can drastically disrupt cybercriminal enterprises. Cyberscam plots can be set as long as people communicate through emails. Online social networks and other websites provide opportunities for cybercriminals.
Over the past two decades, cybercriminals have invented modern ways to intrude upon and obtain personal information from their victims. Only users can guarantee their own protection in the virtual space by installing efficient firewalls, detection systems, prevention strategies, and intrusion systems. These systems may help users reduce internet scams.
Network security is needed to guard computer systems and protect electronic data stored in network computers or transmitted in network systems. To accomplish the goal of network security, users must first understand the danger of cyberattacks, who could become a victim, and how to prevent an attack. The tasks of network protection are to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability of useful data that are transferred in public networks or stored in computers.
Building a deeply layered protection system is the best possible defense tactic in network security. This type of defense system uses multiple layers of defense mechanisms to resist potential attacks. Cyberattackers are often described as Black Hat hackers or cyberterrorists. The basic security model consists of firewalls, anti-malicious software, and intrusion detection systems (IDS systems).







CHAPTER TWO
Cookies, Safety, and Cybersecurity Challenge
Insights

Cybersecurity threats loom over every individual and organization due to the shift from traditional to technological systems. Cyberthreats are a common problem that affects individuals, businesses, and industries across the globe. Everyone with access to the internet and social media, in particular, is at risk of a potential attack. This chapter highlights some strategies individuals and cybersecurity management could use to help counteract cybercriminal efforts. Here, we examine the cybersecurity threats and review some possible solutions that may disrupt potential cybersecurity threats. Some of the victims of cybercriminals include healthcare organizations, which show an increased attack by 125% during the last five years. According to scientific research data, 43% of all attacks targeted small businesses.
Introduction 

In today’s society, the internet has become an essential tool for personal and business transactions. The internet is the new method used for communicating, shopping, and socializing. The emergence of the smart workplace has generated enormous internet traffic, thus increasing cybersecurity threats. The protection of private information is pivotal in the fight against cyberbreaches. One of the reasons why the healthcare industry is considered high risk is because of the new technology offerings of the internet of things (IoT). The internet of things relates to the connectivity of smart devices used for many purposes, including monitoring patients and administering medication. Cybersecurity researchers suggested that many smart devices have very weak security protection; therefore, they are easily hack.
Cybercriminals break into these IoT devices to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, eavesdrop on network traffic, and steal passwords and confidential data. The hacking of IoT devices depicts one example of how people’s private information can be easily breached due to the lack of proper security or outdated technology. As businesses expand and engage in multiple alliances, they become vulnerable to attacks via their customer or vendor portals. Data breaches that result in losses may affect future financial investments as businesses may have to compensate the injured parties. Thus, internet users must be aware of the current threats that cybersecurity poses to society.
Cybersecurity issues continue to present many challenges to internet users and administrators. Cybersecurity administrators have resorted to forming alliances to determine how to organize collective action against cyberattacks and malicious activities that frustrate users. The internet has become a lucrative source of income for cybercriminals. Thus, internet users should not take for granted any activity that seems suspicious. Allowing cookie pop-ups still pose a cyberthreat to users. Cookies, also known as HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), are generated and modified by the server, stored by the browser, and transmitted between the browser and server at each interaction. Cybercriminals are waiting for an opportunity to access this rich pool of information. The health information systems (HIS) have a rich source of information that needs to be secured from cybercriminals. The management of healthcare costs and improving the quality of care are aligned with robust data protection.
Cybercriminals are interested in the data housed in HIS that can be exploited for personal or commercial interests. Therefore, it is critical that healthcare services systems are protected, and a forum is provided to educate hospitals and related health services personnel of the potential danger to minimize data security issues. A 2015 study by Wombat Security Technologies and the Aberdeen Group determined that employee training on cybersecurity can reduce the risk of a cyberattack from 70% to 45%. Whereas public and private partnerships effectively develop appropriate strategies to address nontraditional and traditional data security threats within the context of national cybersecurity, this arrangement is uniquely problematic due to the vulnerability of weak access points within the partnership. 
Academic researchers writing on the cybersecurity challenges suggested that internet users face a present and clear danger as they navigate the World Wide Web, mainly due to the high volume of sensitive information that can be exposed due to the lack of awareness and data security. Data breaches (Data Breach Investigation Report by Verizon 2015) inform us that there were more than 100,000 confirmed cybersecurity incidents in 2014, which resulted in a financial loss of $400 million. Cybersecurity has always been an issue since the advancement of technology and the ability of hackers to breach into secure and unsecured databases.
Cybersecurity management also presents many operations management issues for small and large businesses due to the scale of procedures and policies. One of the major issues relates to the lack of adequate cybersecurity protocols. Academic researchers found that many organizations, including healthcare organizations, failed to maintain a current inventory of sensitive and valuable data. The safety of sensitive data in terms of storage and access is still of grave concern for many clients. In some cases, senior management is unaware of potential cybersecurity threats. Many senior management officers do not understand the importance of management collaboration with partners and cybersecurity administrators. Further, many senior management administrators pay little or no attention to information security governance, planning, implementation, and monitoring systems.
Cybersecurity management faces the issue of protecting their company or organization, including their employees’ confidential information, from unauthorized access. Cybersecurity investments, in many ways, determine the success of the organization. Regarding cybersecurity threats, everyone is a potential target, irrespective of the size of your organization. A study conducted in 2020 found a steady increase in attacks targeting businesses with less than 250 employees, with 43% of all attacks targeted at small businesses in
