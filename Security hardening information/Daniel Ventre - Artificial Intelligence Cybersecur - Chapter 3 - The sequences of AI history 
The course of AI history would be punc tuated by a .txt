efforts of the first period were not in vain, because, in the failures suffered, 
researchers understood what  they had to work on. 
In the 1970s, the immediate objective was no longer the creation of a 
universal, general intelligent machine, but of a specialized intelligence: a 
particular machine should be able to act intelligently in a limited domain19. 
The almost utopian hopes of AI pioneers,  assured of being able to quickly

The sequences of AI history 
The course of AI history would be punc tuated by a succession of advances, 
phases of mania and periods of setbacks , sometimes called “AI winters”. The 
path of AI is, in any case, not linear. While AI is today a worldwide success 
(we are in “the third era of artificial intelligence” today [MIA 18]), a new 
phase of retreat , which could occur ra ther abruptly cannot be excluded. The

On the Origins of Artificial Intelligence     21 
France appears to have been marked by strong skepticism in the 1970s 
and 1980s. The State invested little at the time, and the research community 
was still small: 
“There is a great deal of activity in research in computer vision 
which, as with speech understanding, is a difficult area, 
requiring enormous amounts of computer power. Fortunately, 
the indications are that the power required for many 
applications will be available and economically feasible in 
about ten years. Researchers, th erefore, are currently attacking 
parts of the total problem with the presently available resources, 
leaving the integration of their efforts to the future.” [HOL 76] 
Period 1982–1987 (Spring 2) : Japan’s program for a new generation of 
computers revived the race for AI research, as did Ronald Reagan’s  
so-called “‘Star Wars’ speech”. The great nations embarked on a technological  
race, so as not to be totally overwhelmed and dominated by Japan. It was in 
the efforts for AI and the conquest of  space that the struggle for power 
between states on the international scene was manifested. In the 1980s, 
expert systems proliferated. AI became commercial, and for the military, AI 
at last offered the prospect of applica tions to reinforce operational efficiency. 
Funding was arriving in a massive way.  
Period 1987–2010 (Winter 2) : the positive phase of the early 1980s was 
short. The AI market began to show signs of a significant slowdown as early 
as
