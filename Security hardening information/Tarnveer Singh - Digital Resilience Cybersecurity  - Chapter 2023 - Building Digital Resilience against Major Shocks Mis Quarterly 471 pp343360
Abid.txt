Operational Resilience and Business Continuity Planning
DOI: 10.4324/9781003604969-2


Operational Resilience
Operational resilience is a key imperative that comes to the fore at this juncture. Operational resilience refers to an organisation’s ability to anticipate, withstand, and recover from disruptions while continuing to deliver its products or services at an acceptable level.
Cui et al. (2023) argue that building operational resilience in businesses is vital to avoid being extremely vulnerable to disruption and that digital technologies are highly effective at building resilience within the firm and its supply chain. Without this, information complexities will leave an organisation caught adrift in a highly disruptive event.1
Organisations face a myriad of challenges that can disrupt their operations and threaten their continuity. From natural disasters and cyber attacks to supply chain disruptions and regulatory changes, the risks are numerous and varied. As such, building operational resilience has become a crucial imperative for businesses of all sizes and across all industries.
Xi et al. (2024) argue operational resilience can be further improved by incorporating greater digital technologies such as AI to improve business intelligence and to automate key aspects of resilience improvements. They research intelligent manufacturing and its use of digital technologies, which they conclude has significantly improved operational resilience overall.2
Boh et al. (2023) contend that digital resilience initiatives do require entities to consider and embrace important trade-offs regarding short- vs long-term planning horizons, efficiency vs flexibility, and independence vs interdependence.3
Operational resilience is a proactive approach that involves identifying potential risks, developing contingency plans, and implementing strategies to mitigate the impact of disruptive events.
He et al. (2023) contend transformation leadership enables the organisation to embrace employees with innovativeness and help employees grow their capabilities when facing crises. The dimensions of operational resilience have clear influences on the organisation and employees.4
By fostering operational resilience, businesses can not only survive challenging times but also emerge stronger and better prepared to navigate future uncertainties. We must explore the key components of operational resilience, its importance in ensuring business continuity, and practical strategies for implementing and maintaining a robust resilience framework.
Atadoga et al. (2024) argue emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), AI, and blockchain can help improve intelligence, data gathering, secure data sharing, and continuous risk assessment, which can improve operational and supply chain resilience.5
Shahzad et al. (2024) insist blockchain can be highly effective in improving both operational resilience and supply chain resilience and improving the security of information sharing.6
Business Continuity
Business continuity is a critical aspect of operational resilience, as it focuses on maintaining essential business functions and processes during and after a disruptive event. A comprehensive business continuity plan outlines the strategies, procedures, and resources necessary to ensure the continuity of critical operations and the recovery of disrupted systems and processes.
Steen et al. (2024) emphasise business continuity fits into the framework of operational resilience and that this combined approach allows for a shift in thinking from control to flexibility and from accountability to adaptability, thereby enhancing the capacity for “anticipated improvisation” during crises.7
Onazi (2024) argues effective business continuity planning involves identifying critical business functions, assessing potential risks and their impact, developing recovery strategies, and establishing communication protocols. It also includes provisions for data backup and recovery, alternative work arrangements, and the allocation of necessary resources to support continuity efforts.8
By having a well-designed business continuity plan in place, organisations can minimise downtime, reduce financial losses, maintain customer confidence, and protect their reputation in the face of disruptions.
In today’s volatile and unpredictable business environment, the importance of operational resilience cannot be overstated. Challenging times, such as economic downturns, pandemics, natural disasters, or cyber threats, can have far-reaching consequences for businesses, potentially leading to operational disruptions, financial losses, and reputational damage.
Operational resilience enables organisations to adapt and respond effectively to these challenges, ensuring that critical functions and services remain available to customers, stakeholders, and employees. By proactively identifying and mitigating risks, implementing robust contingency plans, and fostering a culture of resilience, businesses can navigate through turbulent periods with minimal disruption and maintain their competitive edge.
Moreover, operational resilience contributes to long-term sustainability and growth by enhancing an organisation’s ability to recover quickly from setbacks, seize new opportunities, and adapt to changing market conditions. It also instils confidence in stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies, demonstrating the organisation’s commitment to risk management and business continuity.
Building operational resilience involves several key components that work together to create a comprehensive and effective framework. These components include risk assessment and management, business impact analysis (BIA), incident response and crisis management, business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) planning, supply chain resilience, cyber resilience, workforce resilience, and crucially, governance and oversight.
Each of these components plays a crucial role in identifying potential risks, developing mitigation strategies, and ensuring the continuity of critical operations during and after disruptive events.
Effective risk assessment and management are foundational elements of operational resilience. This process involves identifying potential risks that could disrupt business operations, analysing their likelihood and impact, and developing strategies to mitigate or manage those risks.
Risk assessment should be a collaborative effort involving stakeholders from various departments and functions within the organisation. It should consider a wide range of risks, including natural disasters, cyber threats, supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, and geopolitical events.
Once risks have been identified and assessed, organisations can develop and implement risk management strategies tailored to their specific needs. These strategies may include implementing robust cybersecurity measures, diversifying supply chains, and establishing alternative suppliers. Risk management will also involve developing contingency plans for critical business functions and investing in disaster recovery infrastructure. Implementing business continuity plans (BCPs) will be crucial to reduce risk and provide effective planning for risk events. Providing employee training and awareness programmes is very important for employees to understand their roles and responsibilities in the event a business continuity plan needs to be evoked.
Regular risk assessments and updates to risk management strategies are essential to ensure that organisations remain agile and responsive to emerging threats and changing business environments.
Lincke (2024) argues developing a comprehensive BCP is a cornerstone of operational resilience. It outlines the strategies, procedures, and resources necessary to maintain critical business functions and processes during and after a disruptive event.9
Developing an effective BCP involves several key steps. Conducting a business impact analysis (BIA) is a vital first step. The BIA identifies critical business functions, their dependencies, and the potential impact of disruptions on those functions. Identifying recovery strategies is crucial. Based on the BIA, organisations can develop recovery strategies for critical functions, such as data backup and recovery, alternative work arrangements, and the allocation of necessary resources. Establishing communication protocols is important for effectiveness. Effective communication protocols ensure that stakeholders, employees, and customers are kept informed during and after a disruptive event. Defining roles and responsibilities is essential for clarity. Clear roles and responsibilities should be assigned to individuals or teams responsible for executing the BCP. Testing and updating the plan is important to maintain control. Regular testing and updating of the BCP are essential to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in the face of changing business environments and emerging risks.
By developing and implementing a comprehensive BCP, organisations can minimise downtime, reduce financial losses, and maintain customer confidence during disruptive events.
Implementing business continuity strategies effectively is essential. Once a business continuity plan has been developed, it is essential to implement the strategies outlined in the plan effectively. Allocating resources is important, ensuring that the necessary resources, such as personnel, equipment, and facilities, are available to support business continuity efforts. Establishing alternative work arrangements helps in implementing remote work capabilities, identifying alternative work locations, and ensuring that employees have the necessary tools and resources to continue operations during disruptions. Data backup and recovery help businesses reduce risk as through the implementation of robust data backup and recovery solutions we can better protect critical data and ensure its availability during and after disruptive events. Supply chain resilience is important in diversifying supply chains, establishing alternative suppliers, and implementing strategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions. Cyber resilience means that by implementing robust cybersecurity measures, including incident response and recovery plans, we can better protect against cyber threats and ensure the continuity of critical systems and data. Employee training and awareness is vital as by providing regular training and awareness programmes we can ensure that employees understand their roles and responsibilities in supporting business continuity efforts. Effective implementation of business continuity strategies requires a collaborative effort across the organisation, involving stakeholders from various departments and functions.
Regular testing and reviewing of the BCP are essential to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in the face of changing business environments and emerging risks. Testing the BCP helps to identify potential gaps or weaknesses, validate assumptions, and ensure that the plan can be executed effectively in the event of a disruption. There are several approaches to testing a BCP. Tabletop exercises are very useful as these simulated scenarios allow stakeholders to discuss and walk through the BCP, identifying potential issues and refining the plan. Functional testing is highly effective as this involves testing specific components or functions of the BCP, such as data backup and recovery procedures or alternative work arrangements. Full-scale testing is irreplaceable as a comprehensive test of the entire BCP: simulating a real-life disruptive event is highly effective to evaluate the organisation’s readiness and response capabilities.
In addition to testing, it is essential to review and update the BCP regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with the organisation’s current operations, risks, and business environment. This may involve incorporating lessons learned from testing or actual disruptive events. Businesses must update recovery strategies and procedures based on changes in technology or business processes. It is important to regularly review and update risk assessments and business impact analyses. Contact information and resource allocations must be kept up to date.
By regularly testing and reviewing the BCP, organisations can maintain a high level of operational resilience and be better prepared to respond effectively to disruptive events.

Case Studies
Case studies of successful operational resilience can be helpful here. Numerous organisations have demonstrated the value of operational resilience in navigating through challenging times and ensuring business continuity.
HSBC as a financial institution demonstrated resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a bank they quickly adapted to remote work arrangements and implemented robust cybersecurity measures to maintain critical operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their business continuity plans and investments in technology enabled them to continue serving customers and maintaining regulatory compliance.
Volkswagen demonstrated the importance of good supply chain resilience in the automotive industry. They have implemented strategies to diversify their supply chains and establish alternative suppliers in response to disruptions caused by natural disasters, trade disputes, and other events. This has helped them mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions and maintain production levels.
GSK plc have evidenced improvements in their cyber resilience. Health organisations have faced an increasing number of cyber threats, such as ransomware attacks and data breaches. GSK have moved in an agile way to implement robust cyber resilience strategies, including incident response plans and data backup and recovery solutions, which have ensured they are better equipped to protect data and maintain critical services.
Walmart has improved its disaster recovery capabilities. Major retailers like Walmart have invested in disaster recovery solutions, including data centres in multiple geographic locations, to ensure the continuity of their e-commerce platforms and customer-facing systems during natural disasters or other disruptive events.
These case studies highlight the importance of operational resilience and the tangible benefits it can provide to organisations across various industries in the face of challenging circumstances.

Driving Culture Change
Building a culture of operational resilience is crucial. While implementing robust operational resilience strategies and plans is essential, fostering a culture of resilience within the organisation is equally important. Leadership commitment is essential. Senior leadership must champion operational resilience initiatives, allocate necessary resources, and communicate the importance of resilience to the entire organisation. Employee engagement and awareness is important to ensure everyone understands the role they play. Employees at all levels should be trained and made aware of their roles and responsibilities in supporting operational resilience efforts. This can be achieved through regular training, communication, and involvement in testing and exercises. Continuous improvement is vital as without this any plans are just pieces of paper. Organisations should continuously assess and improve their operational resilience strategies based on lessons learned, changes in the business environment, and emerging risks. Cross-functional collaboration is essential in order to bring key stakeholders on board. Operational resilience requires collaboration and coordination across various departments and functions, such as IT, finance, operations, and risk management. Developing a risk-aware mindset is important. Cultivating a risk-aware mindset among employees, where potential risks are identified and addressed proactively, can contribute to a more resilient organisation.
By fostering a culture of operational resilience, organisations can embed resilience into their DNA, ensuring that it becomes an integral part of their decision-making processes, operations, and overall business strategy. Operational resilience is no longer an option but a necessity for organisations seeking to ensure business continuity and long-term success. By proactively identifying and mitigating risks, developing robust business continuity plans, and implementing effective strategies, businesses can navigate through challenging times with minimal disruption and maintain their competitive edge.
Building operational resilience requires a comprehensive approach that involves risk assessment, business impact analysis, incident response planning, supply chain resilience, cyber resilience, and workforce resilience. It also necessitates regular testing and reviewing of business continuity plans to ensure their effectiveness and relevance.
Moreover, fostering a culture of operational resilience within the organisation is crucial. This involves leadership commitment, employee engagement and awareness, continuous improvement, cross-functional collaboration, and a risk-aware mindset.
Ensuring uninterrupted operations is paramount to maintaining a competitive edge. Business continuity planning is a proactive approach that organisations adopt to mitigate potential disruptions and safeguard their operations from unexpected events. It involves creating a comprehensive strategy that outlines the necessary steps to maintain critical business functions and minimise the impact of disruptions on customers, employees, and stakeholders.
BCP is a crucial aspect of risk management, as it enables organisations to identify potential threats, assess their impact, and develop contingency plans to address them effectively. By implementing a well-crafted BCP, companies can enhance their resilience, protect their reputation, and ensure the continuity of essential services during times of crisis.

The Role of Suppliers
Understanding the importance of business continuity planning is necessary for suppliers. As a supplier, your role in the supply chain is critical, and any disruption to your operations can have far-reaching consequences for your customers and their businesses. Implementing a robust business continuity plan is essential to mitigate the risks associated with potential disruptions and ensure the uninterrupted delivery of goods or services to your clients.
Without a comprehensive BCP, suppliers may face significant challenges. Operational disruptions can have a significant impact on businesses and their profitability. Reputational damage can erode relationships with customers, suppliers, partners, and regulators. Financial losses can hamper cashflow and set back investment in growth opportunities. Contractual breaches can be the cause of legal disputes with suppliers and partners. Loss of customer trust is the natural byproduct of all of this. Customers vote with their feet and will walk away from organisations that have security breaches or business continuity problems.
By proactively addressing these risks through a well-designed BCP, suppliers can enhance their resilience, maintain their competitive advantage, and solidify their position as reliable partners in the supply chain.
The risks and challenges faced by suppliers without a BCP are huge. Suppliers without a robust BCP are vulnerable to a wide range of risks and challenges that can severely impact their operations and jeopardise their relationships with customers. These risks can stem from various sources, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, supply chain disruptions, and other unforeseen events.
Significant risks and challenges are faced by suppliers without a BCP. Operational disruptions are damaging. Without a contingency plan in place, suppliers may experience prolonged downtime, leading to delays in production and delivery, which can have severe consequences for their customers’ operations. Financial losses are the effect of disruptions which can result in lost revenue, increased costs, and potential contractual penalties, putting a strain on the supplier’s financial stability. Reputational damage is caused by the failure to deliver goods or services on time. This can tarnish a supplier’s reputation, making it challenging to retain existing customers and attract new ones. Supply chain disruptions are highly impactful. Suppliers are part of a larger supply chain ecosystem, and disruptions at their end can have ripple effects throughout the entire network, causing widespread disruptions and delays. Regulatory compliance issues can have a severe impact. Depending on the industry, suppliers may be subject to various regulatory requirements, and a lack of a BCP can lead to non-compliance and potential legal consequences.
By recognising these risks and challenges, suppliers can appreciate the critical importance of implementing a comprehensive BCP to safeguard their operations and maintain their position as reliable partners in the supply chain.
An effective BCP is a comprehensive and well-structured document that outlines the strategies, procedures, and resources necessary to ensure the continuity of critical operations during and after a disruptive event. Risk assessment helps to identify potential threats and analyse their impact on operations, supply chain, and customer relationships. BIA is important to determine the critical business functions, processes, and resources that must be prioritised and protected during a disruption. Recovery strategies are vital as we must develop strategies to restore and maintain critical operations, such as alternative suppliers, backup facilities, or outsourcing arrangements. Communication plans are vital to establish clear communication protocols to keep stakeholders, employees, and customers informed during a crisis. Incident response plans help to define procedures for responding to and managing various types of incidents, including roles and responsibilities. Testing is important so regularly test and update the BCP to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in the face of changing circumstances.
By incorporating these key components, suppliers can create a robust and adaptable business continuity plan that addresses their unique operational requirements and risk profile, ensuring their ability to maintain essential functions and minimise disruptions.
Conducting a comprehensive risk assessment is a crucial first step in developing an effective BCP for suppliers. This process involves identifying potential threats and analysing their impact on operations, supply chain, and customer relationships. By understanding the risks, suppliers can prioritise their mitigation efforts and allocate resources effectively.
The risk assessment process involves a sequence of activities. Identifying potential threats helps with the analysis. Compile a list of potential threats that could disrupt operations, such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, supply chain disruptions, or geopolitical events. Analyse likelihood and impact. Assess the likelihood of each threat occurring and its potential impact on operations, finances, reputation, and customer relationships. Prioritise risks as not all risks can be dealt with at once. Rank the identified risks based on their likelihood and potential impact, allowing suppliers to focus their efforts on the most critical areas. Develop mitigation strategies based on prioritisation. For each prioritised risk, develop mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood of occurrence or minimise the impact if the risk materialises. Continuous monitoring and review are crucial. Regularly monitor and review the risk assessment to ensure it remains relevant and up to date as circumstances change.
By conducting a thorough risk assessment, suppliers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the threats they face and develop targeted strategies to mitigate those risks, enhancing their overall resilience and ability to maintain operations during disruptive events.
Developing a business continuity strategy is pivotal. After conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, the next step in the business continuity planning process is to develop a robust strategy that outlines the specific actions and procedures to be taken in the event of a disruption. This strategy should be tailored to the unique needs and requirements of the supplier’s operations, supply chain, and customer relationships.
The business continuity strategy for suppliers must focus on improving recovery. Critical business functions are those that are essential for core operations. Identify the essential business functions and processes that must be maintained or restored quickly to minimise disruptions and meet customer obligations. Recovery time objectives (RTOs) must be set. Establish realistic timeframes for restoring critical functions, taking into account the potential impact on customers and stakeholders. Recovery point objectives (RPOs) must be identified. Determine the acceptable amount of data loss or operational disruption that can be tolerated before significant consequences occur. Resource requirements should be considered. Assess the necessary resources, such as personnel, equipment, facilities, and technology, required to execute the business continuity strategy effectively. Alternative suppliers and contingency plans must be considered. Identify alternative suppliers or contingency plans for obtaining critical materials, components, or services in the event of a disruption in the primary supply chain. Communication protocols should be put in place. Establish clear communication protocols for disseminating information to employees, customers, and stakeholders during a crisis, ensuring transparency and effective coordination.
By developing a comprehensive business continuity strategy, suppliers can proactively address potential disruptions and minimise their impact on operations, customers, and stakeholders, ultimately enhancing their resilience and competitiveness in the market.
Implementing and testing the BCP is the next step. Once the BCP has been developed, it is crucial to implement and regularly test it to ensure its effectiveness in the event of an actual disruption. Implementing the plan relies on key measures being taken. Training and awareness is an essential component. Conduct training sessions for all employees to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in executing the BCP. Raise awareness about the importance of the BCP and its potential impact on the organisation. Resource allocation must be assessed. Allocate the necessary resources, such as personnel, equipment, facilities, and technology, to support the implementation and ongoing maintenance of the BCP. Documentation and communication must provide clarity. Document the BCP in a clear and accessible format, and ensure it is communicated to all relevant stakeholders, including employees, customers, and partners. Testing and validation are crucial in providing assurance. Regularly conduct simulations, tabletop exercises, and live tests to validate the effectiveness of the BCP and identify areas for improvement. Testing should cover various scenarios, including IT system failures, supply chain disruptions, and natural disasters. Continuous improvement offers the opportunity of review and embedding learning. Based on the results of testing and feedback from stakeholders, continuously review and update the BCP to ensure it remains relevant and effective in addressing evolving risks and challenges.
By implementing and testing the BCP, suppliers can ensure that their strategies and procedures are well understood, properly executed, and capable of minimising the impact of disruptions on their operations and customer relationships.
To maximise the effectiveness of their business continuity planning efforts, suppliers should adopt best practices. Engage key stakeholders, including employees, customers, and partners, in the development and testing of the BCP to ensure their perspectives and requirements are considered. Align with industry standards and regulations related to business continuity planning, such as ISO 22301 or industry-specific guidelines. Leverage technology solutions, such as cloud-based services, remote work capabilities, and advanced data backup and recovery systems, to enhance the resilience and flexibility of operations. Foster collaboration and information sharing with partners, suppliers, and customers to ensure a coordinated and effective response to disruptions across the supply chain. Identify and prioritise the most critical business functions and processes, allocating resources accordingly to ensure their continuity during a disruption. Treat the BCP as a living document: regularly review and update it to reflect changes in the business environment, risks, and operational requirements. Cultivate a culture of resilience within the organisation, encouraging employee awareness, participation, and continuous improvement in business continuity planning efforts.
By adopting these best practices, suppliers can enhance the effectiveness of their business continuity planning efforts, ensuring they are well prepared to navigate disruptions and maintain uninterrupted operations, ultimately strengthening their position as reliable partners in the supply chain.
To support their business continuity planning efforts, suppliers can leverage a variety of tools and resources. Business continuity planning software is very useful. Specialised software solutions are designed to streamline the business continuity planning process, including risk assessment, plan development, testing, and maintenance. Numerous online resources offer templates, guides, and best practices for developing and implementing effective business continuity plans. Professional associations and regulatory bodies often provide guidance, standards, and resources specific to the supplier’s industry or sector. Consulting services are widely available. Experienced consultants and firms specialising in business continuity planning can provide valuable expertise and support throughout the process. Various organisations offer training and certification programmes to equip suppliers with the knowledge and skills necessary for effective business continuity planning. Participating in peer networks and communities can facilitate knowledge sharing, collaboration, and best practice exchange among suppliers facing similar challenges.
By leveraging these tools and resources, suppliers can gain access to valuable insights, expertise, and support, enabling them to develop and implement robust BCPs tailored to their unique operational requirements and risk profiles.
In today’s dynamic and interconnected business environment, ensuring uninterrupted operations is a critical imperative for suppliers. By implementing a comprehensive BCP, suppliers can proactively address potential disruptions, mitigate risks, and maintain their ability to deliver goods and services to customers without interruption.
Business continuity planning is not a one-time exercise but rather an ongoing process that requires regular review, testing, and updating to adapt to changing circumstances. By embracing best practices, leveraging available tools and resources, and fostering a culture of resilience, suppliers can enhance their preparedness and strengthen their position as reliable partners in the supply chain.
Remember, a well-executed BCP not only safeguards operations but also protects the supplier’s reputation, customer relationships, and long-term competitiveness in the market. Invest in business continuity planning today to ensure your organisation is equipped to navigate disruptions and maintain uninterrupted operations, delivering value to your customers and stakeholders.
