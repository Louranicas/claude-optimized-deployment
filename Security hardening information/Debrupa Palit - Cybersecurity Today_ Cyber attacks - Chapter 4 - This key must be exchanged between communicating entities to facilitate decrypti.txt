Through symmetric encryption algorithms, data is transformed so that it becomes incomprehensible without the corresponding secret key. Once the recipient possessing the key receives the message, the algorithm reverses its process, restoring the message to its original readable form. The secret key, shared between sender and recipient, can either be a specific password/code or a random string of characters generated by a secure random number generator.

This key must be exchanged between communicating entities to facilitate decryption.
Through symmetric encryption algorithms, data is transformed so that it becomes incomprehensible without the corresponding secret key. Once the recipient possessing the key receives the message, the algorithm reverses its process, restoring the message to its original readable form. The secret key, shared between sender and recipient, can either be a specific password/code or a random string of characters generated by a secure random number generator. It incorporates the following:

An encryption function that transforms a given plain text into ciphertext using a secret key.
A decryption function that reverses the process, converting the ciphertext back to plain text using the same secret key:

Plain text involves unencrypted data, including natural language text or binary code, where the information is directly accessible. Ciphertext denotes encrypted data whose information is meant to be inaccessible before decryption. Two types of symmetric encryption algorithms are:

Block algorithms: These encrypt fixed-lengths of bits in blocks of electronic data using a specific secret key. The system retains the data in its memory as it awaits complete blocks during the encryption process.
Stream algorithms: Unlike block algorithms, data is encrypted in real-time as it streams, without the need for storing in the system's memory.

A secure symmetric key cryptosystem must guarantee the following properties to protect both statically stored data and communications over transmission channels:

Confidentiality: Ensures that the information within encrypted messages remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties.
Integrity: Detects any unauthorized alteration of encrypted messages during storage or transmission.
Authenticity: Allows the receiver to verify the sender's identity and identify any attempts at impersonation by unauthorized entities.

These properties should be upheld even when the encryption and decryption algorithms or ciphers are publicly known, with access to encrypted message content exclusively controlled through the secret key. Implementing a secure symmetric key cryptosystem involves two primary tasks. Utilizing a robust symmetric key encryption algorithm resilient to cryptographic attacks. Guaranteeing confidentiality in the distribution and management of secret keys.
Several examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include:

AES
Data Encryption Standard (DES)
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
Blowfish (can replace DES or IDEA)
Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4)
Rivest Cipher 5 (RC5)
Rivest Cipher 6 (RC6)

Among these, AES, DES, IDEA, Blowfish, RC5, and RC6 operate as block ciphers, while RC4 functions as a stream cipher.
Advanced Encryption Standard
The AES is a specification for encrypting electronic data, established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in
