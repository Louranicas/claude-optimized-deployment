Chapter: 61398 - The most conclusive statement made was that the “…
Communist Party of China is tasking the Chinese People’s Liberation Army
[Unit 61398 and others] to commit systematic cyber-espionage and data
theft...” (Mandiant, 2013, p. 7). It can be further agreed that some of that
training, equipment and expertise is provided by Huawei directly to the PLA. 
The 
Far Eastern Economic Review
 reported “…Huawei received a key
contract to supply the PLA’s first national telecommunications network”
(Ahrens, 2013).  These ties point to connections with the Chinese government
and the PLA; there is little doubt that China continues aggressive cyber-
activities in support of its intentions to increase its economic standing in the
world.
China has not demonstrated a desire to quash cyber-espionage
activities from within its borders.  It can be surmised that many Chinese
cyber-activities are supported and controlled under the auspices of the
Chinese government.  The most lucrative target for China, and more
specifically Huawei, is the US; it will continue to focus its vast resources
against US economic and business entities.
Additionally, Huawei has multiple cyber-relevant capabilities to
include hardware and software development, IT manufacturing, and in-house
technical expertise.  However, the major capability afforded Huawei is
through its direct backing by the Chinese government. As noted, in terms of
government contracts and resources Huawei has powerful direct support.
In terms of its infrastructure, it is vast and vibrant.  Access to the
Internet as a surreptitious mechanism to hide its activities is another potential
threat posed by Huawei to subvert the worlds’ IT architecture.  By leveraging
its own internal infrastructure, in conjunction with the Chinese state, it has
near limitless capabilities to disrupt the US and its allies via the Internet. 
According to Lachow, Huawei as a 
complex
 agent, would require “…
a team of individuals (or perhaps multiple teams) with expertise in a number
of technical areas...” (Lachow, 2008, p. 444).  Huawei, in coordination with
the PLA (or vice versa), has access to such formidable resources; “[t]he PLA
is reaching out across a wide swath of [the] Chinese civilian sector to meet
the intensive requirements necessary to support its burgeoning [Information
Warfare] capabilities, incorporating people with specialized skills from
commercial industry…” (Krekel, 2009, p. 7).
Huawei should be expected to mostly use the Internet for passive
cyber-espionage collection activities; however, it has the potential to engage
in more active operations.  This could include establishing secretive
Command and Control (C2) nodes within its own sold equipment and
software, and also in “infected” competitors’ equipment sold in the
international marketplace.  With this access, it could pose a formidable
offensive capability.
Huawei has a huge target-set to pursue.  With its growth throughout
the global IT marketplace, any nation requiring IT products offers a target-
rich environment for Huawei to exploit. Targets available to Huawei are
wide-ranging and span the entire developed and industrial nations that
conduct regular business with Huawei.
All countries are potentially exploitable especially in terms of their
reliance on the Internet.  The need for computer hardware and software by all
developed nations affords a consistent and regular vulnerability.   It can be
surmised that Huawei personnel have the requisite knowledge and ability to
exploit all levels of its manufactured products (and those of its competitors);
this capability provides a direct ability to align with Beijing’s motivations to
become the predominant economic powerhouse of the world.
In terms of cyber-espionage, the magnitude is greater than $445 B
annually “…to the world economy” (Nakashima & Peterson, 2014) as
identified in a 2014 
Washington Post
 article.  If the allegations against
Huawei are true, the potential economic loss to the world could be far greater
if Huawei has expanded capacity to process the volumes of exfiltrated data. 
The graver implications would be damage to the global economy more in the
trillions of dollars annually in stolen intellectual property and data.
The severest, and more exploitive consequence would be Huawei
could have the ability to leverage injected malicious code in its products. 
This would imply the ability to shutdown portions or the entire Internet
because of its control of foundational backbone hardware devices such as
routers, switches, and firewalls.  While the ongoing cyber-espionage
economic losses to countries are serious, it has the potential to inflict massive
offensive harm against countries or groups that in the future it may be in
conflict to include the US.

Conclusion
Huawei is a 
complex
 threat.  Lachow reserves this label to highly
coordinated and effective state actors with nearly unlimited resources. 
Huawei is such a threat with the obligatory skill-sets to a very diverse and
technologically capable adversary. With the presumptive backing of the
Chinese government, and its resources, Huawei continues to be a major threat
to US and international governments and their respective economies.
While there is no conclusive or public evidence, that China through
its surrogate Huawei has injected malicious coding into any of its products,
the risk is formidable.  Michael Maloof, a former senior security policy
analyst in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, ascribes from sources that
“[t]he Chinese government reportedly has "pervasive access" to some 80
percent of the world's communications, thanks to backdoors it has ordered to
be installed in devices made by 
Huawei
” (Protalinski, 2012).  Jim Lewis, at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies
 provides an ominous point
of view working with Chinese businesses: “The Chinese will tell you that
stealing technology and business secrets [are] a way of building their
economy, and that this is important for national security” (Metz, 2013).  The
risk to the US’s national security, its economic viability, and its critical
infrastructure is directly threatened by the Chinese regime.
