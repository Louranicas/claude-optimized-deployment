Chapter: 3 - There are five main components of the proposed system. Authors have explained in this section in brief about all the modules.
Notification Module: Figure 5.4 shows the workflow of the notification module proposed in this literature, when the case or issue is flagged by Cybersecurity Rating platform, and Figure 5.5 shows the workflow of notification module during closure of the flagged issue or case.
This module will trigger notification to the user/Business owner regarding the issue flagged in the Cybersecurity Rating Platforms. It will generate the detailed notification regarding name of issue like Unique ID for tracking purpose, IP/DNS/Website the issue is flagged, its severity, and overall score impact for the organization. Figure 5.6 shows the details of Notification in JSON Format.

There are five main components of the proposed system. Authors have explained in this section in brief about all the modules.
Notification Module: Figure 5.4 shows the workflow of the notification module proposed in this literature, when the case or issue is flagged by Cybersecurity Rating platform, and Figure 5.5 shows the workflow of notification module during closure of the flagged issue or case.
This module will trigger notification to the user/Business owner regarding the issue flagged in the Cybersecurity Rating Platforms. It will generate the detailed notification regarding name of issue like Unique ID for tracking purpose, IP/DNS/Website the issue is flagged, its severity, and overall score impact for the organization. Figure 5.6 shows the details of Notification in JSON Format.

Figure 5.3 System architecture.




Figure 5.4 Workflow for logging an issue.


Later according to the proposed framework, these reported issues will be first evaluated internally by the DevOps module powered by AI to check if the reported issue is true positive or false positive. If it is false positive, evidence will be generated and log will be forwarded against the Issue ID, in Cybersecurity rating platforms, for closing the logged issues. If the issue is true positive, then again, the proposed DevOps module powered by AI will be activated, and it will create a Sand Box environment (Say a docker‐based container), which is explained in detail later in this section.
