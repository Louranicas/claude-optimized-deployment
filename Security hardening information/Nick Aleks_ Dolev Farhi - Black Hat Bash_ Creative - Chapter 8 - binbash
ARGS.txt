❹ stty echo

Listing 10-8: A fake sudo script
At ❷, we turn off input echoing by using stty -echo. We then read input from the user and present a sudo-like prompt ❸. As the input is the user’s password, it shouldn’t be presented in cleartext to the user while they’re typing it. This is because, by default, sudo hides the input while it’s being typed, and we need to emulate the look and feel of the original command. So, we disable input echoing before accepting input from the user.
Next, we leak the provided password by using the leak_over_http() function. This function will use base64 to encode the password and use curl to make an HTTP GET request to a path on the web server, using the captured password as the path ❶.
At ❹, we turn on input echoing and pass the password, along with the command the user executed, to the real sudo binary (/usr/bin/sudo) so that the sudo execution resumes normally. Figure 10-1 highlights this flow from end to end.

Finally, on your Kali machine, use Python to run a simple HTTP server:
$ python -m http.server 8080

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/)...

Then open another terminal to p-jumpbox-01 (172.16.10.13) and run a sudo command:
$ sudo vi --help

[sudo] password for backup:

You should receive the leaked password:
172.16.10.13 - - [22:59:32] "GET /YmFja3VwCg HTTP/1.1" 404 -
The bolded base64-encoded string is backup, which is the password of the backup user.

Exercise 21: Hijacking Password Utilities
You could use an approach similar to the sudo attack we just performed to hijack other utilities. Any tool that interacts with credentials can help you gain persistence, including the following:
passwd For changing local user passwords
chpasswd For updating passwords in bulk
htpasswd For setting up or changing Apache basic authentication
smbpasswd For changing Samba user passwords (such as Active Directory user passwords)
ldappasswd For changing Lightweight Directory Access Protocol user passwords
Try programming a fake command that accepts passwords as input. Here is guidance on how to go about this:
