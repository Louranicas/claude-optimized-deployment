Chapter: 2 - Republican A. J. Cousin, the elected representative of St. Tammany Parish, was kidnapped. He was seized by two men, held briefly in prison then forced on board a steamer. To his friends and family, it appeared he had simply disappeared. He was seen standing on a New Orleans corner, and then he was gone. No one heard a word from him.
His kidnappers treated him well, he later told reporters, telling him nothing would happen to him—unless there was an attempt to rescue him. In that case they would kill him.
He was held under armed guard in the woods a few miles outside the town of Covington. His captors told him that he had been taken to prevent Republicans from gaining control of the legislature. He would be released after that body had been officially organized, they promised.
The legislature convened on the fourth. Fearing violence, Metropolitans guarded all the entrances to the State House while more than a thousand army troops occupied the surrounding streets and the levees. A sea of curious people surrounded the building, filling streets and squares; among them were an unknown number of unarmed White Leaguers, supposedly there to preserve the peace. Only state officials and men claiming seats in the legislature were admitted. The Senate organized without difficulty.
General Sheridan set up headquarters in the St. Charles Hotel; “Governor” McEnery established his own headquarters only a few yards away, in Antoine’s Restaurant.
When the House was called into session, fifty-two Republicans and fifty Democrats were present. The first order of business was electing a temporary chairman. The clerk called for nominations—and the Democrats put their plan into action. Seconds after someone on the floor nominated former mayor Louis Wiltz, a Congressional investigation reported, “As quick as thought upon the putting of the motion...[Wiltz] sprang to the Speaker’s desk where the Clerk was standing, seized the gavel from his hand and pushed the Clerk violently off the stand and declared himself temporary Speaker.”
The chamber erupted in bedlam! Men began screaming to be recognized, one louder than the next until no one voice could be heard. It didn’t matter; Wiltz simply ignored them all. A justice of the peace appeared as if magically and swore him into office.
As the din continued, Wiltz swore the members into office—among them all the Democratic candidates for the five disputed seats! That gave him a clear majority. With the gavel in his hand, Wiltz bullied his way through several appointments, utilizing or ignoring parliamentary order as it suited his purpose.
Furious Republicans refused to accept the Democratic takeover; instead, they decided to deny Wiltz the necessary quorum by walking out. Their intention was to organize elsewhere, establishing a second legislature that would be recognized as legitimate by Kellogg. But as they began leaving, doors swung open and about thirty-five strong, young men, presumably White Leaguers, entered; Wiltz welcomed them, announcing they were the new sergeants at arms. He swore them in, then ordered them to prevent Republicans from leaving. He intended to keep the House in session all day and into the night.
Republican legislators trying to escape from chamber were blocked by these men, but some evaded them, making it to the lobby where they were pulled outside by police officers. The tug-of-war between the White Leaguers and police continued for several minutes. A mob of supporters and protestors crammed into the already-crowded lobby. Supposedly guns and knives were drawn, and there were rumors that punches were thrown, but there was no serious violence.
While the situation was still boiling, Wiltz asked General Regis de Trobriand, in command of the federal troops in the building, to clear the lobby. The general reluctantly agreed. For a few minutes, at least, Wiltz had his quorum and began conducting business, primarily appointing Democrats to government positions.
Meanwhile, a group of “escaped” Republicans appealed to Kellogg for assistance. The governor ordered General Emory to take action. Minutes later General de Trobriand reappeared in the House, this time following Republican orders. He was alone and showed Wiltz his orders to remove those Democrats who had not been declared elected by the legal Returning Board.
Wiltz refused. “I cannot instruct members to leave the hall,” he said defiantly. “You must use force to compel them!”
If necessary, the general responded, he would do exactly that. Then he left. Minutes later he returned, now accompanied by about two dozen armed troops. Each disputed member was pointed out, and two soldiers, bayonets fixed on their rifles, went to that desk and escorted him out of the now-silent chamber.
Wiltz was the last to go. As he was being removed from the speaker’s rostrum he protested “against the invasion of our hall by soldiers of the United States with drawn bayonets and loaded muskets. We have seen our brother members violently seized by force of arms... The officers of the House are prisoners... I solemnly declare that Louisiana has ceased to be a sovereign state...”
He was escorted out, followed by all the Democrats and conservatives. They reassembled in a nearby hotel. Once again, they organized an impotent legislature and began meeting.
The State House remained surrounded by soldiers. A cannon was placed at each entrance. Wooden planks were nailed across doors and windows. Other troops remained stationed in nearby streets to prevent an attempt at mob rule.
Inside, Republicans elected a speaker, swore in their chosen members and went to work.
Somehow, Democrats had managed to turn an embarrassing defeat into a victory. The specter of the army occupying a state legislature was devastating for President Grant. The details may have been disputed and confusing, but what Americans read about was the national government once again imposing its political will on a state government. Since Lee’s surrender to Grant, nothing had done more to unify the South than the use of soldiers to impose political objectives. Legislatures in numerous states voted to censure or condemn the action. The New York Herald wondered if Grant would “decide who shall belong to the next Congress and enforce his decisions with five or six regiments of United States troops.” The Nation suggested, “At this pace...the President has the right to inflict capital punishment with his own hand.” The great orator William Cullen Bryant had been a founder of the Republican party and a strong supporter of Lincoln, but this was too much for him. Speaking in New York several days later, he warned the nation “...when it is done in one state, it is done in all!”
In this type of sensitive situation, a careless word or phrase can be picked up, amplified and become a rallying cry. While the army was still protecting the State House, General Sheridan sent a telegram to Grant: “I think that the terrorism now existing in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas could be entirely removed and confidence and fair dealing established by the arrest and trial of the ringleaders of the White Leagues. If Congress would declare them banditti they could be tried by military commission. The leaders of this banditti...should be punished...”
It was the banditti who had been behind three or four thousand murders, he claimed.
Banditti! It was a rarely used word that carried an ominous tone. It was an insult—and when the telegram leaked the contents to the public, the Democrats considered it a badge of honor. They embraced it: we are all banditti!
Rather than Sheridan’s intended meaning, White Leaguers, Democrats and conservatives gave it a far different meaning: people who had been fighting against the usurpation of political power—especially the use of troops to impose a government on the people. They were fighters for democracy!
Sheridan was vilified for his remark. His life was threatened. At least one newspaper suggested he should be hanged from a lamppost. When he dared appear on New Orleans streets, people shouted curses at him. Friends ignored him. He tried to backtrack, telling a New York Times reporter, “I don’t suppose there is a sensible man in the State who really imagines I mean all the people were banditti, for they are not blunderers and robbers!”
But it was much too late. The Grant administration was struggling against a resistance that had the support of many white Americans. If the president had any chance of being reelected in 1876, he had to end this mess. In December, the US House had created the seven-member Committee on the Condition of Affairs in the South, headed by Republican abolitionist George Frisbee Hoar, to find a solution. A three-member subcommittee was dispatched to New Orleans to investigate the 1874 election. They happened to be there to witness the disastrous attempt to open the newly elected House.
After interviewing ninety-five witnesses, their fifteen-hundred-page report concluded the actions of the Returning Board in 1874 were “arbitrary, unjust and, in our opinion, illegal.” The election was fair and peaceful, the report continued, and the result was “a clear conservative majority was elected to the lower house.”
For Republicans, this report was a disaster. A bipartisan Congressional committee was telling the nation the election had been stolen. As far as Republican legislators were concerned, there was only one possible solution: appoint another committee. Claiming the first committee was only investigating to determine if the election was worth investigating, a second committee, this one headed by Hoar, went to New Orleans. Not unexpectedly, this group reached the completely opposite conclusion. It described a climate of intimidation and bloodshed, citing numerous acts of threats and violence, concluding the ’74 election was fraudulent at the ballot box rather than with the Returning Board.
The recommendation? Accept the Kellogg government.
In March 1875, the House passed a resolution recognizing Kellogg as “the governor of the State of Louisiana until the end of the term of office fixed by the Constitution of that State.”
Two weeks later the Senate approved a similar resolution; although, rather than simply upholding Kellogg’s election, it acknowledged that President Grant, “in protecting the government...and the people against domestic violence and in enforcing laws of the United States in that State,” had done the right thing.
Those resolutions had little meaning. Nothing significant had changed. No member of either party trusted any election returns. Holding political power had become a matter of who could best manipulate the system—and who had the guns. Republicans controlled the cities, with the support of the military and police, while Democrats and conservatives dominated the rural areas of the State.
The situation may have been best summarized during a debate in the US Senate. Republican Senator John Logan, from Illinois, said that there had been such extensive fraud in 1872 that neither Kellogg nor McEnery had been legally elected, then asked Maryland’s Democratic Senator William Hamilton if he endorsed the overthrowing of Louisiana’s government.
Hamilton had a ready answer. There was no state government to overthrow.
His remark was greeted with laughter on the Senate floor and cheers from spectators in the gallery. Hamilton continued, reminding Logan that “American freedom was born in revolution and rebellion and the sympathies of the American people were always with those whose rose against oppression and tyranny.”
The cheers from the gallery were so great that the spectators were told to leave.
After more than two years, there still was no agreeable way to settle the situation. The debate continued on the floor and in committees of the United States Congress. The search for a compromise continued without success. Among the casualties of the stalemate was the nomination of P. B. S. Pinchback to the Senate; the divided Senate refused to seat him, and his nomination was eventually withdrawn.
The consequences had been incalculable. General Sheridan estimated more than thirty-five hundred people had been killed. The State was essentially bankrupt: taxes were high, collections were low. Property values had crashed. There were vacant storefronts on every block. Vital government services had been curtailed or ended. Countless men were unable to find work. Banks were not making loans. A huge increase in crime had made city streets unsafe while vigilantes controlled the countryside. Efforts at integration had stalled, and the State was slowly fading back into separate Black and white societies.
There was no leadership, no respect for government, no trust and, perhaps most devastating, no hope.
It would still be several decades before a new type of music they named jazz emerged from the streets of New Orleans; it could not have been born anywhere else. No other place had the soul for it. The word itself supposedly derived from the slang term jasm, meaning a special level of energy, drive, vitality, vim; or, as a dictionary notes, “a zest for accomplishment.” But defining or describing jazz is far more difficult. It’s music not bound by conventional structure. It’s the musical expression of freedom, played from the heart rather than written notes.
It was born as a reflection of life in New Orleans, with its lack of predictability, its constant surprises and its shifting focus; in jazz, every player has their moment. And that accurately described the state of politics in Louisiana in 1876. Warmoth, Kellogg, McEnery, Penn, Pinchback, Antoine and even Sheridan all were playing their own tunes. Each one of them had taken the lead for moments, but no one was really in charge. Several proposals had been made to restore some structure to the system, and for a brief time there was a semblance of harmony, but eventually all attempts to forge some type of compromise failed.
Having tried just about every other tactic to oust Republicans from state government, in March 1876, Democrats in the divided House collected enough votes to impeach Governor Kellogg. Among the fourteen articles, Kellogg was accused of making illegal appointments, failing to conduct regular inspections and sending armed police into the State House. There was no real intent to remove Kellogg from office; this was an attempt to weaken him politically. In fact, the House intentionally waited until the last possible moment before voting to impeach him, believing the Senate had adjourned, meaning Kellogg would remain suspended until it reconvened. The governor rebuffed that effort by recalling the State Senate for an extra ten-day session.
In anticipation of that ploy, the fourteenth article of impeachment charged Kellogg with illegally convening the Senate, but not the House, in an extra session—beginning the day after the House voted to impeach him!
The New Orleans Bulletin admitted the real strategy. “We do not believe the impeachment would succeed; but it is nevertheless the duty of the House to proceed as it would, and thus throw the blame for the failure on the Senate.”
The Republican responded in defense of Kellogg. “No Governor of a State has ever been so maliciously persecuted by a minority from his induction in office...”
Kellogg dutifully answered every charge as this political charade played out. The Senate quickly acquitted him, then rebuffed a series of complicated parliamentary maneuvers to reinstate the charges.
This was pure politics; it marked the beginning of the 1876 presidential election campaign, one destined to become among the most contentious in American history. Until then the nation had watched Louisiana’s political struggles with some combination of fascination, curiosity, astonishment and perhaps even amusement, but it had remained a state problem. No more.
The State’s once-local difficulties were about to explode nationally and would come perilously close to destroying the American electoral system.
President Grant had equivocated about running for a third term. Several scandals had weakened his administration, and his controversial decision to send the army to Louisiana had cost him significant support. Finally, a House resolution declaring it would be “unwise, unpatriotic, and fraught with peril to our free institutions” for a president to run for a third term had convinced him to stay out of the election.
He would not be a candidate for reelection, he said, claiming, “I do not want to be here another four years. I do not think I could stand it.”
To replace Grant on the ticket, in mid-June Republicans nominated Ohio governor Rutherford Birchard Hayes. A strong abolitionist, Hayes had worked his way up the Union ranks, wounded five times during the war, to become a brevet major general. Hayes was considered so honest that for the first time, Mark Twain became actively involved in politics, explaining, “In truth I care little about any party politics, the man behind it is the important thing.”
Weeks later, while the nation was stunned by reports that young, charismatic General George Custer and about three hundred men of his 7th Cavalry had been massacred by a coalition of Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes at Little Bighorn River, the Democrats met in St. Louis and gave their nomination to New York governor Samuel J. Tilden. While Democrats lauded Tilden for his honesty and integrity, Republicans immediately portrayed him as a lawyer who had made a “colossal fortune” representing the unpopular railroad interests.
A key issue in the campaign was the fate of Reconstruction. While both candidates had fought for the Union, Tilden’s supporters believed that after sixteen years of Republican control of the White House, a Democratic president would help bring an end to Grant’s postwar policies.
In Louisiana, Kellogg’s decision not to run for another term had thrown open the race for governor. Among the leading candidates to replace him? Henry C. Warmoth, who immediately began maneuvering for the Republican nomination. “His followers are those who crave for the lavish times of his former administration,” the Picayune reported.
As the United States prepared to celebrate its centennial on the Fourth of July, Louisiana Republicans spent a week battling for the gubernatorial nomination. Essentially, the race pitted Kellogg’s nominee, federal marshal Stephen Packard, against both Warmoth and Pinchback. The rivalry between Warmoth and Packard was especially personal and bitter because years earlier the marshal had been among the leaders of the effort to impeach the former governor.
The convention immediately dissolved into a shambles; within the first hours men were screaming to be heard, jumping on chairs, throwing things at the podium and literally wrestling in the aisles. When pistols were produced the police had to be summoned to prevent violence.
And that was just to elect a temporary chairman.
It took five days and one seriously wounded delegate before they agreed on a compromise that allowed the convention to proceed. The first ballot was won by Packard, with Warmoth second. But by then it had become clear to the former governor that he could not win the nomination. On Independence Day he told the convention, “When I go into a fight I mean to keep it up until I am licked. I entered this fight with the purpose of succeeding... I will suffer no humiliation that I did not succeed in all.”
Reporters noted that contrary to Warmoth’s “gay and nonchalant air, a deep under-current of feeling [was] welling up from the springs of disappointment and crushed aspirations.”
The convention nominated Packard. Democrats immediately tried to link him to Grant, blaming him for the presence of federal troops in the state.
Candidates for the Democratic nomination included McEnery, Ogden, Penn, Wiltz and Francis Redding Tillou Nicholls, an attorney, former slave owner and West Point graduate who had literally lost an arm and a leg fighting for the Confederacy. What also set Nicholls apart was the fact that, unlike the other candidates, he came from the countryside, from rural Assumption Parish in southern Louisiana, and had not been involved in the political fighting. What made him further different from all the others was his claim that he did not especially want to be governor. There is little more appealing to voters than a politician who claims not to want their vote.
He was nominated on the fourth ballot.
The two candidates were as different as blue and gray: Packard was a city man, a US Marshal as comfortable with the bigwigs in Washington as he was in the French Quarter, while Nicholls represented the forgotten white working man.
Although the future of Reconstruction was not officially on the ballot, it was the subtext of the election.
In the cities, the parties held big, colorful, raucous rallies offering food and lots to drink, with brass bands and banners and earnest political promises. But in the country, the campaign was marked by terror, night riders, warnings and killings. Democrats acknowledged the violence but claimed it was a Republican attempt to provide the necessary excuse for Grant to send in troops—and provoke a response.
The vilest attack took place in Ouachita Parish the Saturday night before the election. As many as thirty white men broke into the cabin of former slaves Henry and Eliza Pinkston. Henry’s crime was attending a recent Republican rally. “He votes no Radical ticket here,” one of the raiding party shouted. “He may vote in hell!” The men then shot Pinkston seven times. When Eliza tried to stop them she was slashed, shot, raped, hit with an axe, her teeth knocked out and shot again. Somehow, she survived to later testify that after killing her husband, his killers had cut her baby’s throat and thrown its body in a lake.
Although Eliza Pinkston was rumored to be a troubled woman with a dark past, a woman whose word too often was doubtful, the bodies of her husband and child were real. As was the blood that soaked her clothing.
This was the horror story that led America into the election of 1876. It was an apt beginning.

Republican A. J. Cousin, the elected representative of St. Tammany Parish, was kidnapped. He was seized by two men, held briefly in prison then forced on board a steamer. To his friends and family, it appeared he had simply disappeared. He was seen standing on a New Orleans corner, and then he was gone. No one heard a word from him.
His kidnappers treated him well, he later told reporters, telling him nothing would happen to him—unless there was an attempt to rescue him. In that case they would kill him.
He was held under armed guard in the woods a few miles outside the town of Covington. His captors told him that he had been taken to prevent Republicans from gaining control of the legislature. He would be released after that body had been officially organized, they promised.
The legislature convened on the fourth. Fearing violence, Metropolitans guarded all the entrances to the State House while more than a thousand army troops occupied the surrounding streets and the levees. A sea of curious people surrounded the building, filling streets and squares; among them were an unknown number of unarmed White Leaguers, supposedly there to preserve the peace. Only state officials and men claiming seats in the legislature were admitted. The Senate organized without difficulty.
General Sheridan set up headquarters in the St. Charles Hotel; “Governor” McEnery established his own headquarters only a few yards away, in Antoine’s Restaurant.
When the House was called into session, fifty-two Republicans and fifty Democrats were present. The first order of business was electing a temporary chairman.

As the din continued, Wiltz swore the members into office—among them all the Democratic candidates for the five disputed seats! That gave him a clear majority. With the gavel in his hand, Wiltz bullied his way through several appointments, utilizing or ignoring parliamentary order as it suited his purpose.
Furious Republicans refused to accept the Democratic takeover; instead, they decided to deny Wiltz the necessary quorum by walking out. Their intention was to organize elsewhere, establishing a second legislature that would be recognized as legitimate by Kellogg. But as they began leaving, doors swung open and about thirty-five strong, young men, presumably White Leaguers, entered; Wiltz welcomed them, announcing they were the new sergeants at arms. He swore them in, then ordered them to prevent Republicans from leaving. He intended to keep the House in session all day and into the night.
Republican legislators trying to escape from chamber were blocked by these men, but some evaded them, making it to the lobby where they were pulled outside by police officers. The tug-of-war between the White Leaguers and police continued for several minutes. A mob of supporters and protestors crammed into the already-crowded lobby.

For a few minutes, at least, Wiltz had his quorum and began conducting business, primarily appointing Democrats to government positions.
Meanwhile, a group of “escaped” Republicans appealed to Kellogg for assistance. The governor ordered General Emory to take action. Minutes later General de Trobriand reappeared in the House, this time following Republican orders. He was alone and showed Wiltz his orders to remove those Democrats who had not been declared elected by the legal Returning Board.
Wiltz refused. “I cannot instruct members to leave the hall,” he said defiantly. “You must use force to compel them!”
If necessary, the general responded, he would do exactly that. Then he left. Minutes later he returned, now accompanied by about two dozen armed troops. Each disputed member was pointed out, and two soldiers, bayonets fixed on their rifles, went to that desk and escorted him out of the now-silent chamber.
Wiltz was the last to go. As he was being removed from the speaker’s rostrum he protested “against the invasion of our hall by soldiers of the United States with drawn bayonets and loaded muskets. We have seen our brother members violently seized by force of arms... The officers of the House are prisoners... I solemnly declare that Louisiana has ceased to be a sovereign state...”
He was escorted out, followed by all the Democrats and conservatives. They reassembled in a nearby hotel. Once again, they organized an impotent legislature and began meeting.
The State House remained surrounded by soldiers. A cannon was placed at each entrance. Wooden planks were nailed across doors and windows. Other troops remained stationed in nearby streets to prevent an attempt at mob rule.
Inside, Republicans elected a speaker, swore in their chosen members and went to work.
Somehow, Democrats had managed to turn an embarrassing defeat into a victory. The specter of the army occupying a state legislature was devastating for President Grant. The details may have been disputed and confusing, but what Americans read about was the national government once again imposing its political will on a state government. Since Lee’s surrender to Grant, nothing had done more to unify the South than the use of soldiers to impose political objectives. Legislatures in numerous states voted to censure or condemn the action. The New York Herald wondered if Grant would “decide who shall belong to the next Congress and enforce his decisions with five or six regiments of United States troops.” The Nation suggested, “At this pace...the President has the right to inflict capital punishment with his own hand.” The great orator William Cullen Bryant had been a founder of the Republican party and a strong supporter of Lincoln, but this was too much for him. Speaking in New York several days later, he warned the nation “...when it is done in one state, it is done in all!”
In this type of sensitive situation, a careless word or phrase can be picked up, amplified and become a rallying cry. While the army was still protecting the State House, General Sheridan sent a telegram to Grant: “I think that the terrorism now existing in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas could be entirely removed and confidence and fair dealing established by the arrest and trial of the ringleaders of the White Leagues. If Congress would declare them banditti they could be tried by military commission. The leaders of this banditti...should be punished...”
It was the banditti who had been behind three or four thousand murders, he claimed.
Banditti! It was a rarely used word that carried an ominous tone. It was an insult—and when the telegram leaked the contents to the public, the Democrats considered it a badge of honor. They embraced it: we are all banditti!
Rather than Sheridan’s intended meaning, White Leaguers, Democrats and conservatives gave it a far different meaning: people who had been fighting against the usurpation of political power—especially the use of troops to impose a government on the people. They were fighters for democracy!
Sheridan was vilified for his remark. His life was threatened. At least one newspaper suggested he should be hanged from a lamppost. When he dared appear on New Orleans streets, people shouted curses at him. Friends ignored him. He tried to backtrack, telling a New York Times reporter, “I don’t suppose there is a sensible man in the State who really imagines I mean all the people were banditti, for they are not blunderers and robbers!”
But it was much too late. The Grant administration was struggling against a resistance that had the support of many white Americans. If the president had any chance of being reelected in 1876, he had to end this mess. In December, the US House had created the seven-member Committee on the Condition of Affairs in the South, headed by Republican abolitionist George Frisbee Hoar, to find a solution. A three-member subcommittee was dispatched to New Orleans to investigate the 1874 election. They happened to be there to witness the disastrous attempt to open the newly elected House.
After interviewing ninety-five witnesses, their fifteen-hundred-page report concluded the actions of the Returning Board in 1874 were “arbitrary, unjust and, in our opinion, illegal.” The election was fair and peaceful, the report continued, and the result was “a clear conservative majority was elected to the lower house.”
For Republicans, this report was a disaster. A bipartisan Congressional committee was telling the nation the election had been stolen. As far as Republican legislators were concerned, there was only one possible solution: appoint another committee. Claiming the first committee was only investigating to determine if the election was worth investigating, a second committee, this one headed by Hoar, went to New Orleans. Not unexpectedly, this group reached the completely opposite conclusion. It described a climate of intimidation and bloodshed, citing numerous acts of threats and violence, concluding the ’74 election was fraudulent at the ballot box rather than with the Returning Board.
The recommendation? Accept the Kellogg government.
In March 1875, the House passed a resolution recognizing Kellogg as “the governor of the State of Louisiana until the end of the term of office fixed by the Constitution of that State.”
Two weeks later the Senate approved a similar resolution; although, rather than simply upholding Kellogg’s election, it acknowledged that President Grant, “in protecting the government...and the people against domestic violence and in enforcing laws of the United States in that State,” had done the right thing.
Those resolutions had little meaning. Nothing significant had changed. No member of either party trusted any election returns. Holding political power had become a matter of who could best manipulate the system—and who had the guns. Republicans controlled the cities, with the support of the military and police, while Democrats and conservatives dominated the rural areas of the State.
The situation may have been best summarized during a debate in the US Senate. Republican Senator John Logan, from Illinois, said that there had been such extensive fraud in 1872 that neither Kellogg nor McEnery had been legally elected, then asked Maryland’s Democratic Senator William Hamilton if he endorsed the overthrowing of Louisiana’s government.
Hamilton had a ready answer. There was no state government to overthrow.
His remark was greeted with laughter on the Senate floor and cheers from spectators in the gallery. Hamilton continued, reminding Logan that “American freedom was born in revolution and rebellion and the sympathies of the American people were always with those whose rose against oppression and tyranny.”
The cheers from the gallery were so great that the spectators were told to leave.
After more than two years, there still was no agreeable way to settle the situation. The debate continued on the floor and in committees of the United States Congress. The search for a compromise continued without success. Among the casualties of the stalemate was the nomination of P. B. S. Pinchback to the Senate; the divided Senate refused to seat him, and his nomination was eventually withdrawn.
The consequences had been incalculable. General Sheridan estimated more than thirty-five hundred people had been killed. The State was essentially bankrupt: taxes were high, collections were low. Property values had crashed. There were vacant storefronts on every block. Vital government services had been curtailed or ended. Countless men were unable to find work. Banks were not making loans. A huge increase in crime had made city streets unsafe while vigilantes controlled the countryside. Efforts at integration had stalled, and the State was slowly fading back into separate Black and white societies.
There was no leadership, no respect for government, no trust and, perhaps most devastating, no hope.
It would still be several decades before a new type of music they named jazz emerged from the streets of New Orleans; it could not have been born anywhere else. No other place had the soul for it. The word itself supposedly derived from the slang term jasm, meaning a special level of energy, drive, vitality, vim; or, as a dictionary notes, “a zest for accomplishment.” But defining or describing jazz is far more difficult. It’s music not bound by conventional structure. It’s the musical expression of freedom, played from the heart rather than written notes.
It was born as a reflection of life in New Orleans, with its lack of predictability, its constant surprises and its shifting focus; in jazz, every player has their moment. And that accurately described the state of politics in Louisiana in 1876. Warmoth, Kellogg, McEnery, Penn, Pinchback, Antoine and even Sheridan all were playing their own tunes. Each one of them had taken the lead for moments, but no one was really in charge. Several proposals had been made to restore some structure to the system, and for a brief time there was a semblance of harmony, but eventually all attempts to forge some type of compromise failed.
Having tried just about every other tactic to oust Republicans from state government, in March 1876, Democrats in the divided House collected enough votes to impeach Governor Kellogg. Among the fourteen articles, Kellogg was accused of making illegal appointments, failing to conduct regular inspections and sending armed police into the State House.

In fact, the House intentionally waited until the last possible moment before voting to impeach him, believing the Senate had adjourned, meaning Kellogg would remain suspended until it reconvened. The governor rebuffed that effort by recalling the State Senate for an extra ten-day session.
In anticipation of that ploy, the fourteenth article of impeachment charged Kellogg with illegally convening the Senate, but not the House, in an extra session—beginning the day after the House voted to impeach him!
The New Orleans Bulletin admitted the real strategy. “We do not believe the impeachment would succeed; but it is nevertheless the duty of the House to proceed as it would, and thus throw the blame for the failure on the Senate.”
The Republican responded in defense of Kellogg. “No Governor of a State has ever been so maliciously persecuted by a minority from his induction in office...”
Kellogg dutifully answered every charge as this political charade played out. The Senate quickly acquitted him, then rebuffed a series of complicated parliamentary maneuvers to reinstate the charges.
This was pure politics; it marked the beginning of the 1876 presidential election campaign, one destined to become among the most contentious in American history. Until then the nation had watched Louisiana’s political struggles with some combination of fascination, curiosity, astonishment and perhaps even amusement, but it had remained a state problem. No more.
The State’s once-local difficulties were about to explode nationally and would come perilously close to destroying the American electoral system.
President Grant had equivocated about running for a third term. Several scandals had weakened his administration, and his controversial decision to send the army to Louisiana had cost him significant support. Finally, a House resolution declaring it would be “unwise, unpatriotic, and fraught with peril to our free institutions” for a president to run for a third term had convinced him to stay out of the election.
He would not be a candidate for reelection, he said, claiming, “I do not want to be here another four years. I do not think I could stand it.”
To replace Grant on the ticket, in mid-June Republicans nominated Ohio governor Rutherford Birchard Hayes. A strong abolitionist, Hayes had worked his way up the Union ranks, wounded five times during the war, to become a brevet major general. Hayes was considered so honest that for the first time, Mark Twain became actively involved in politics, explaining, “In truth I care little about any party politics, the man behind it is the important thing.”
Weeks later, while the nation was stunned by reports that young, charismatic General George Custer and about three hundred men of his 7th Cavalry had been massacred by a coalition of Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes at Little Bighorn River, the Democrats met in St. Louis and gave their nomination to New York governor Samuel J. Tilden. While Democrats lauded Tilden for his honesty and integrity, Republicans immediately portrayed him as a lawyer who had made a “colossal fortune” representing the unpopular railroad interests.
A key issue in the campaign was the fate of Reconstruction. While both candidates had fought for the Union, Tilden’s supporters believed that after sixteen years of Republican control of the White House, a Democratic president would help bring an end to Grant’s postwar policies.
In Louisiana, Kellogg’s decision not to run for another term had thrown open the race for governor. Among the leading candidates to replace him? Henry C. Warmoth, who immediately began maneuvering for the Republican nomination. “His followers are those who crave for the lavish times of his former administration,” the Picayune reported.
As the United States prepared to celebrate its centennial on the Fourth of July, Louisiana Republicans spent a week battling for the gubernatorial nomination. Essentially, the race pitted Kellogg’s nominee, federal marshal Stephen Packard, against both Warmoth and Pinchback. The rivalry between Warmoth and Packard was especially personal and bitter because years earlier the marshal had been among the leaders of the effort to impeach the former governor.
The convention immediately dissolved into a shambles; within the first hours men were screaming to be heard, jumping on chairs, throwing things at the podium and literally wrestling in the aisles. When pistols were produced the police had to be summoned to prevent violence.
And that was just to elect a temporary chairman.
It took five days and one seriously wounded delegate before they agreed on a compromise that allowed the convention to proceed. The first ballot was won by Packard, with Warmoth second. But by then it had become clear to the former governor that he could not win the nomination. On Independence Day he told the convention, “When I go into a fight I mean to keep it up until I am licked. I entered this fight with the purpose of succeeding... I will suffer no humiliation that I did not succeed in all.”
Reporters noted that contrary to Warmoth’s “gay and nonchalant air, a deep under-current of feeling [was] welling up from the springs of disappointment and crushed aspirations.”
The convention nominated Packard. Democrats immediately tried to link him to Grant, blaming him for the presence of federal troops in the state.
Candidates for the Democratic nomination included McEnery, Ogden, Penn, Wiltz and Francis Redding Tillou Nicholls, an attorney, former slave owner and West Point graduate who had literally lost an arm and a leg fighting for the Confederacy. What also set Nicholls apart was the fact that, unlike the other candidates, he came from the countryside, from rural Assumption Parish in southern Louisiana, and had not been involved in the political fighting. What made him further different from all the others was his claim that he did not especially want to be governor. There is little more appealing to voters than a politician who claims not to want their vote.
He was nominated on the fourth ballot.
The two candidates were as different as blue and gray: Packard was a city man, a US Marshal as comfortable with the bigwigs in Washington as he was in the French Quarter, while Nicholls represented the forgotten white working man.
Although the future of Reconstruction was not officially on the ballot, it was the subtext of the election.
In the cities, the parties held big, colorful, raucous rallies offering food and lots to drink, with brass bands and banners and earnest political promises. But in the country, the campaign was marked by terror, night riders, warnings and killings. Democrats acknowledged the violence but claimed it was a Republican attempt to provide the necessary excuse for Grant to send in troops—and provoke a response.
The vilest attack took place in Ouachita Parish the Saturday night before the election. As many as thirty white men broke into the cabin of former slaves Henry and Eliza Pinkston. Henry’s crime was attending a recent Republican rally. “He votes no Radical ticket here,” one of the raiding party shouted. “He may vote in hell!” The men then shot Pinkston seven times. When Eliza tried to stop them she was slashed, shot, raped, hit with an axe, her teeth knocked out and shot again. Somehow, she survived to later testify that after killing her husband, his killers had cut her baby’s throat and thrown its body in a lake.
Although Eliza Pinkston was rumored to be a troubled woman with a dark past, a woman whose word too often was doubtful, the bodies of her husband and child were real. As was the blood that soaked her clothing.
This was the horror story that led America into the election of 1876. It was an apt beginning.









16
On November 7, 1876, in a celebration of American democracy, almost 8,500,000 men went to their local polling stations and cast their ballot for either Rutherford B. Hayes or Samuel J. Tilden. Countless thousands of people traveled long distances or braved winter weather; in many places they waited patiently in unusually long lines. They did it because they believed in the system of government and wanted their say.
The election had been bitterly contested. As a result, the highest percentage of eligible voters in the nation’s hundred-year history had made their opinion known. The actual voting process went smoothly. America sent a message to the rest of the world: This is how a democracy functions. One man, one vote!
But then they started counting those votes.
The system collapsed. The fire that had been sparked in Louisiana four years earlier had spread and engulfed the entire nation. In several states it was impossible to determine which candidate had won, which votes counted or how many people had been frightened away from the polls. The outcome in those states would determine the winner of its electoral votes, and with that the next president. All of the still-unresolved issues that had thrown Louisiana into turmoil were now a national problem.



Louisiana’s collapsed government played a significant role in the bitterly contested 1876 presidential election.


As a result, rather than being elected by voters, the president of the United States would be selected by a Congressional committee.
In the days following the election Tilden was reported to have a 260,000-vote lead. Democrats were celebrating. The numbers told the story: Republican rule of the postwar era was finished. Even Hayes acknowledged his loss, admitting, “I think we are defeated... I am of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.”
Tilden was on the verge of becoming the first man in history to lose the presidency with a majority of the popular vote. But even with his substantial lead, he was guaranteed only 184 electoral votes—one short of the 185 needed to become president. He had to find one more electoral vote.
Hayes was far behind with 165 electoral votes. He was prepared to concede the election—until New York Times editor John Reid convinced Republican leaders to wait. Incredibly, due to a quirk in the electoral system, there was a slim chance Hayes could become the first person elected president with a minority of the popular vote. Four states, with a total of twenty electoral votes, had not declared a winner. If he were to win them all, he would become president—by that one, elusive electoral vote. That certainly was possible, Reid noted; each of those Southern states had a Republican governor. So while most newspapers in the nation were declaring Tilden the winner, Reid’s Times ran with a different message: The Battle Won. Governor Hayes Elected.
The election would be decided by Florida, South Carolina, Oregon and, of course, Louisiana.
Four years of negotiating, debating, arguing, compromise and violence had settled absolutely nothing in Louisiana. Both parties claimed victory. Republicans announced that Hayes had won the state’s eight electoral votes, Packard had been elected governor by 3,500 votes, and they had elected three members of Congress while keeping control of the state legislature. Conversely, Democrats claimed Tilden had carried the state, Nicholls had been elected governor by about 8,000 votes, they had won four Congressional seats and a majority in the state legislature.
Even in 1860, when the election of Lincoln led to the Civil War, voters had accepted the results. Southerners did not question the results of the election, they objected to the policies of the Republican majority being imposed on them. In fact, the constitution of the Confederate states established an electoral system derived from the United States Constitution, including an electoral college rather than direct election by popular vote.
It wasn’t said very often, but in addition to an established structure, described by written rules and regulations, the American electoral system required an element of trust. It had worked, at least until 1860, because people trusted that the outcome was fair, that the will of the majority was respected, and that if their candidate or party lost this time, within a few years there would be another election, and the opposition, should the outcome be reversed, would grant the winner the same respect.
In Louisiana, the loss of that trust had resulted in the establishment of two governments, massacres at Colfax and Coushatta, numerous other acts of violence and Gatling guns in the streets of New Orleans.
It was easy, and chilling, to imagine what might happen if the entire nation lost trust in the electoral system.
The reported vote totals were ignored as both parties accused the other of rigging the presidential election. The accusations were the same as they’d been in the state but magnified: Republicans claimed threats and widespread violence had kept thousands of freedmen from the polls in the countryside.
Democrats protested that thousands of legitimate votes for Tilden had been miscounted, discarded or mutilated, and that ballot boxes in heavily Democratic areas simply disappeared.
Republicans countered that Democrats had stuffed those ballot boxes, allowed supporters to cast multiple votes and in some places had even printed Democratic tickets bearing Lincoln’s picture, tricking illiterate voters into believing they were supporting Republicans.
The “official” totals were incredibly close. Of the 47,000 votes cast in Florida, for example, Republicans claimed Hayes had won by 922; meanwhile, Democrats reported Tilden had a razor-thin 94-vote margin.
According to South Carolina election officials, an incredible 101 percent of all eligible voters had cast ballots; one county reported 2,000 more votes than it had registered voters.
Oregon’s Democratic governor dismissed a Hayes elector for a minor technical violation, replacing him with a Democratic Tilden vote—the one vote he needed. He was replaced yet again before casting what would have been the deciding vote.
And Louisiana? The Times reported from New Orleans, “The feeling here today is that the national contest has narrowed down uncomfortably close to five debatable parishes...it comes to a question of counting or rejecting the votes of several parishes.” Kellogg told reporters that returns should not be counted because the parishes had been heavily guarded by White League members, who had been “reinforced by armed bodies from Arkansas and Mississippi, [and] most of the Republican leaders had been driven away or murdered...”
In those parishes, the report continued, no one could vote Republican “without the danger of exile or assassination. There is no law there, and no order, except the law of the revolver.” The intimidation worked: in one of those places, East Feliciana, more than two thousand freedmen were registered—and not a single vote for Hayes was recorded.
No one knew how to resolve the Louisiana conundrum. Grant notified his military leaders to be ready to “preserve peace and order,” using force if necessary, then dispatched a committee to New Orleans to monitor the work of the Returning Board. These were men, Grant said, “of irreproachable character and respectability, whose opinions and judgment would carry conviction to the whole American people.” Among them were the Civil War general Lew Wallace, who was just beginning to write the classic Ben-Hur, and Congressman James A. Garfield. The Democratic National Committee also sent representatives to the city to watch the counting. Newspapers around the country began referring to the observers as “the national jury.”
The state’s gubernatorial election was just as confusing and contentious. Just as Kellogg and McEnery had done, both Packard and Nicholls claimed victory and began setting up their administrations.
Newspapers were filled with the most recent results of the national and local elections, which bounced back and forth day-to-day, morning to afternoon, sometimes hour by hour. A Republican note claimed, “The customary salutation each morning now is: ‘Well, who is elected today?’”
The Louisiana Returning Board consisted of four men, two white, two Black, charged with reading reports, hearing evidence, tallying ballots and interviewing witnesses to try to reach a fair conclusion. Should they limit their count to votes actually cast, which clearly included fraudulent ballots, or should they rely on registration numbers to estimate the number of votes Republicans would have received in a different atmosphere? The impossibility of that task was reinforced by the very first letter the Board opened, which threatened, “If you swindle us again your lives will pay the forfeit... We are armed, organized and sworn to do our duty...”
The Board was not above reproach. Each of its four members had some questionable dealings in their past. There were some reports that the Board had put itself up for sale, supposedly asking the Democratic National Committee for $1,000,000 in return for certifying Tilden’s victory. One member of the Board later claimed that it actually was the Democrats who had offered a bribe, and when it was rejected, party officials maliciously instituted criminal proceedings against Board members. In fact, one member eventually was sentenced to two years at hard labor, although that sentence was never carried out, and another member’s once-profitable stable business essentially was destroyed. As Henry Warmoth explained, “Corruption is the fashion.”
Similar rumors concerning bribes and threats surfaced in Florida and South Carolina as those states struggled to count votes. A South Carolina elector, for example, said he had been offered $10,000 to vote for Tilden.
As those Returning Boards, or canvassing boards as they were known in the other states, plodded through claims, records and eyewitness testimonies, trying to find order in chaos, supporters of both candidates began to fear they were being cheated out of the presidency. Anger escalated. Newspapers began reporting “Plain Talk about a Political Civil War,” in which “The will of the majority would be expressed by firearms.” Militias began girding for action. Several Democratic commanders contacted Tilden, volunteering to support any effort he mounted. Indiana claimed to have five hundred thousand men ready to fight for him. Iowa Republicans informed Hayes that they had a hundred-thousand-man army ready to respond.
As the race tightened even Hayes became more aggressive. After the Civil War, a fellow member of the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, William McKinley, recalled how Hayes’s demeanor changed completely in combat. “From the sunny, agreeable, kind, generous gentleman’s gentleman...he was, once the battle was on...intense and ferocious.”
The battle was on. All thoughts of concession had long ago disappeared. Hayes threw himself into the fight.
By this point it had become obvious that this election was not going to be decided by the numbers. The system had failed. It could not be modified to fit the circumstances. No matter who was finally declared the winner—in both the federal and state elections—a huge segment of the population was going to be disillusioned and disenfranchised. Too many of them owned guns, and as had been seen, they were not hesitant to use them. The goal became finding some acceptable means of keeping the country from descending into chaos.
In early December, the Louisiana Returning Board declared Republicans had carried the state: the electoral college votes would go to Hayes. The Board also ruled that Packard had beaten Nicholls and would become governor and Republicans had won four of the six Congressional seats and both houses of the state legislature. That legislature presumably would send two Republicans to the Senate.
It was a resounding victory, even if few people believed it.
To justify that result, the Returning Board had to throw out or modify the count from ten parishes—eventually 15,000 votes were rejected, 13,000 of them for Tilden. The entire returns from Grant Parish and East Feliciana were declared invalid. In Grant Parish “not one form of law was observed...the vote taken was as informal as votes taken on a railroad train...
“Evidence as to intimidation by murder, hanging, whipping and other outrages as affecting the vote at other polls was so conclusive that the returning officers unanimously rejected the votes cast at those polls...”
Results from eight polling stations in Ouachita were rejected for various reasons, among them “the United States Deputy Marshal in charge of the ballot box was shot...”
Democrats fought back. A state senator claimed that the Returning Board had acted illegally, stating that Democrats “were in possession of certain clues, which, in time, would lead to important revelations, intimating that some of the members of the board would be put on a rack so excruciating as to force confession from their unwilling lips!” Tilden’s supporters believed that, even if no such evidence was ever produced.
Believing the action of the Returning Board to be illegal, de jure Governor McEnery certified a slate of Democratic electors to vote for Tilden. When those men met in the State House on the morning of December 7 to actually cast those votes, Kellogg ordered police to clear the hall. The Democrats refused to leave, forcing Kellogg to back down. The electors chose a representative to take their McEnery certificates of election to Washington.
Nicholls remained calm as the election wound its way through the legal system, expressing confidence in the outcome—and setting up his own new administration.
The canvassing boards in Florida and South Carolina were also finding creative ways to justify giving their electoral votes to Hayes. A Democratic congressman, upon being told Florida would go to Hayes, threatened, “There is nothing for Democrats to do except to buy muskets.”
A Democratic party leader predicted that “within a hundred days people would be cutting each other’s throats.”
Republicans warned, “Any attempt to defeat this will be followed by the tramp of armed men—men who have marched before and are no mere holiday soldiers.”
The Congressional investigations continued into the new year without resolution. It was a fine political show: the hearings generated a lot of headlines, a lot of promises were made, suggestions were offered and nothing of consequence got done. Meanwhile in New Orleans, to thwart a threatened Democratic takeover of the State House, Governor Kellogg stationed a hundred and fifty Metropolitans in and around the building.
In preparation for the new session, which was scheduled to begin at noon on January 1, Republican legislators occupied the building on December 31 and spent the night there. Supper with a wine selection was served.
The legislature went into session just after twelve o’clock. Minutes later several hundred Democrats, among them both elected and defeated politicians, marched up to the front door and demanded to be admitted. A police officer blocked their way, keeping a steady hand on the butt of his gun. Too many men had been shot recently not to take precautions.
The Democrats eventually left to organize their own legislature elsewhere. The situation was a repeat from four years earlier: Louisiana had two men claiming to be governor, two legislatures, two courts and two officials in numerous state posts. One newspaper even suggested Kellogg remain in office until the dispute was finally settled, which would have given the state three governors.
On January 8, a dull and gloomy day, Packard was sworn into office in the barricaded State House, “notwithstanding the threats against my life which are freely bandied about.” At the same time, on the balcony of St. Patrick’s Hall, as a band played “Hail to the Chief,” Francis Nicholls was sworn into the same office, promising that his administration would promote kindness, sympathy, confidence and justice.
The only trouble that day came from a group of street toughs who cut the reins and harnesses of carriages in front of the St. Louis Hotel. Governor Kellogg’s carriage was badly damaged. Governor Nicholls issued an order that the mob disperse, which was instantly obeyed.
It was as if time had stopped; years had passed but nothing had changed. The next day ten thousand Nicholls supporters clogged the streets and closed down the city. They took control of the Supreme Court building and swore in Democratic judges, who opened the Court and began hearing cases. They took control of the Third Precinct station house and then one by one every other station surrendered without a shot fired. They occupied the arsenal. They cut telegraph wires. By early in the afternoon Nicholls’s men occupied every government building in the city other than the State House, which was completely encircled.
Three hundred Metropolitans armed with Winchester rifles took defensive positions in the hallways and at the doors and windows inside. There were hundreds more people in the building, and every one of them was armed, including the senators and representatives. Late in the afternoon several Democrats knocked on the State House door. They were answered by three shots, fired well above their heads.
Kellogg and Packard pleaded with army commanders for help from troops waiting in the nearby Orleans Hotel. That help was never given. Governor Packard told reporters his men would resist any effort to capture the State House.
Governor Nicholls, hoping to avoid bloodshed, urged his supporters to go home peacefully.
President Grant refused to recognize either man as governor, although his secretary of the interior, Zach Chandler, wired Packard telling him, “Make an attack if you have to die in the street.” Packard, who essentially was trapped inside the State House, politely declined the suggestion. The situation in New Orleans had reached an impasse. There was no government. Once again, people simply chose which man to follow.
The fact that Nicholls had not been legally elected governor made little difference. His supporters occupied all of the essential buildings in the city, as well as government offices in most parishes. Just about the only building of importance that remained in Republican hands was “Fort Packard” as Democrats began referring to the State House. Democrats appointed a citizens’ group to collect advance payments of taxes and, surprisingly, announced that enough people had voluntarily paid a portion of their taxes to pay outstanding debts.
Privately, Nicholls’s takeover was supported by city business interests, especially the Cotton Exchange, which enabled his government to function.
Gradually, Louisianians began to accept the reality of the Nicholls administration.
The national situation continued to deteriorate. The media reported every threat. An armed insurrection seemed almost inevitable. A Congressional committee released copies of wires sent to several Southern states by Interior Secretary Chandler days after the election, “evidently intended to incite fraud and tampering with the returns.” There was some evidence that Florida Republicans had offered the secretary a substantial bribe to “deliver the state to Hayes.” That committee demanded the Louisiana Returning Board come to Washington with all the materials it had used to determine the outcome of the election. When the four members of the Board refused, the committee charged them with contempt of Congress and ordered them arrested.
Congressional Republicans objected, arguing that the Constitution specifically gives states the right to appoint its presidential electors, and Congress had no power to interfere with how they did it. Senator James A. Garfield noted that beyond the rights mentioned in the Constitution, the federal government has no more rights to investigate State elections “than they would have to inquire into the conduct of an election in England.”
Garfield was firm in his words: it is entirely up to each State to determine how its presidential electors would be chosen and what restrictions—if any—were placed upon them. The federal government had no power to interfere with that process.
The Founding Fathers had given the new nation a constitution that had worked extraordinarily well for the first hundred years...until it didn’t. It had created a foundation on which to grow and build but in too many places lacked necessary details. It had been left to politicians and judges to do the patchwork.
Just to further confuse the situation, a group of Democrats in Congress decided it might be a good time to impeach Grant for “misuse of the army and other offenses.”
The president responded to that threat by warning the leaders of the effort he would have them arrested.
The government that Lincoln had only a decade earlier lauded as “of the people, by the people and for the people” had lost its legitimacy. The electoral system had collapsed, leaving the United States on the edge of anarchy. This situation had never been anticipated; there was no legal mechanism for dealing with it.
Congressional committees investigating the legitimacy of the returns also demanded that Western Union produce copies of all telegrams relating to the election from the contested states. Company officials resisted initially but after being threatened with subpoenas agreed to comply. Congress specifically wanted to see a telegram sent to Florida by the Democratic national chairman which said, according to the Times, “Florida must be held and counted for Tilden at all hazards, and any money which was necessary to secure that end would be furnished.”
The same question that had paralyzed Louisiana now threatened to rip open all the national wounds. Who would count the electoral votes? Republicans insisted Article II
