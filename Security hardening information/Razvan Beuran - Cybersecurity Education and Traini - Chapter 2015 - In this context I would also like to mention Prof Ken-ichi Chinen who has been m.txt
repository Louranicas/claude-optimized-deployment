# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Razvan Beuran - Cybersecurity Education and Training (2025, Springer Nature Singapore) - libgen.li
Chapter: 2015 - In this context, I would also like to mention Prof. Ken-ichi Chinen, who has been my main collaborator at the Cyber Range Organization and Design chair at JAIST. Many of the ideas presented in this book were born through the stimulating discussions I had with them.
In addition, I cannot forget all the students in my lab at JAIST who contributed to the many research projects whose accomplishments laid the foundation for this book. They are listed next in chronological order of their study period: Cuong Pham, Dat Thanh Tang, Takuya Inoue, Jidong Wang, Zheyu Tan, Min Zhao, Liangwen Yuan, Zhe Zhang, Youmeizi Zeng, Zhenguo Hu, Tan Duy Le, Sian En Ooi, Quyen Van Nguyen, and Thanh Phuong Huynh Nguyen. Thank you all!
Furthermore, several Chinen lab students, such as Fumikazu Awa, Masanori Sunagawa and Gen Komatsu, as well as minor research project or internship students, such as Muhammad Harith bin Noor Azam, Chunqi Du, Lei Jiang, Kien Chi Vu, Wataru Mishima, Yuichiro Sakamoto, and Yoshiki Makino, have made important contributions to our research projects, and I am also very grateful to them.
Last but not least, I would like to wholeheartedly thank Assoc. Prof. Jan Vykopal, Prof. Herve Debar, and Prof. Youki Kadobayashi, who have been so kind as to review this manuscript. The insightful comments and suggestions they have provided have helped me significantly improve the book.
