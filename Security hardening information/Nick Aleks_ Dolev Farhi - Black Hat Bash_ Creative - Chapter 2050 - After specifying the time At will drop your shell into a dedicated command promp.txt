Chapter: 2050 - After specifying the time, At will drop your shell into a dedicated command prompt (at>), where you can enter shell commands line by line. To save the job, use CTRL-D.
The at command also provides a way to see the queue of jobs (by using atq) and remove them (by using atrm). To list all queued At jobs, run the following command:
$ atq

After specifying the time, At will drop your shell into a dedicated command prompt (at>), where you can enter shell commands line by line. To save the job, use CTRL-D.
The at command also provides a way to see the queue of jobs (by using atq) and remove them (by using atrm). To list all queued At jobs, run the following command:
$ atq

1 Sun May 28 22:20:00 a root
2 Sun May 29 23:20:00 a root

Each job has an ID (1 and 2 in this case), the time at which they will execute, and the user who scheduled it. After a job is submitted, you can generally find the job definition located under /var/spool/cron/atjobs:
$ ls -l /var/spool/cron/atjobs/
total 8
-rwx------ 1 root daemon 2405 May 28 02:32 a0000101ac9454
-rwx------ 1 root daemon 2405 May 28 02:32 a0000201ac9454

By default, unprivileged users cannot read this directory. Other possible At job directories include /var/spool/cron/atspool, /var/spool/at, and /var/spool/ at/spool.
You can remove queued jobs by using atrm followed by the job ID:
$ atrm 1
Like Cron, At uses deny (/etc/at.deny) and allow (/etc/at.allow) files to determine which users can schedule jobs.
Exercise 14: Writing a Cron Job Script to Find Credentials
The objective of this exercise is to write a monitoring cron job script. This script should periodically search the system for files containing credentials. Create a cron job to do the following:
