# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Gregory C. Rasner - Cybersecurity and Third-Party Risk_ Third Party Threat Hunting (2021, Wiley) - libgen.li
Chapter: 2018 - The post explains that HyperbBro is commonly attributed 
to the cybercriminal group named “LuckyMouse,” a Chinese-  
speaking threat actor known for highly targeted cyberattacks. 
Primarily active in South East and Central Asia, many of their 
attacks have a political aim. Tmanger is attributed to TA428, also 
a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. Because these 
two applications are used normally by different APT s and are now 
together in one attack, the ESET team theorizes that LuckyMouse 
and TA428 are sharing data and weapons; they are also likely the 
subgroup of a larger APT. Given the region and threat actors, it is 
considered to be a political attack that had been planned as early 
as May 2018, yet not carried out in earnest until two years later.
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is the term given to 
state actors (i.e., government run or authorized hackers) or 
large cybercriminal syndicates that have a lot of time and 
patience to perform very stealthy, large-scale attacks aimed 
at political or economic goals.
4 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
The SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack
On December 13, 2020, FireEye, a global leader in cybersecurity, 
publishes on its website the first details about the SolarWinds 
Supply-Chain Attack, a global intrusion campaign inserting a 
trojan into the SolarWinds Orion business software updates to 
distribute the malware. FireEye names the malware  “Sunburst.” 
After the attackers successfully hacked into FireEye, their 
 activity demonstrated lateral movement and data exfiltration. 
“The actors behind this campaign gained access to numerous 
public and private organizations around the world. . . . This cam-
paign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently 
ongoing. . . . The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor 
and the operation was conducted with significant operational 
security,” as explained in the Summary from FireEye’s website 
on December 13th.
The attackers added a .dll file (a configuration file) called 
SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll to the Orion prod-
uct, which had been digitally signed and enabled backdoor com-
munications over HTTP (i.e., normal, unencrypted web traffic), 
to other servers. The Sunburst malware is suspected to have lain 
quietly for two weeks, while it performed some reconnaissance 
via executing commands that led to file transfers and to control-
ling the victim’s servers (i.e., reboots, disabling services). Using a 
native product within Orion, the Orion Improvement Program 
(OIP), Sunburst blended in with the program’s normal functions 
expertly. It even had the capability to sniff out the antivirus and 
cybersecurity forensic tools being used, likely to learn how to 
better go undetected.
“As much as anything, this attack provides a moment of 
reckoning. It requires that we look with clear eyes at the growing 
threats we face and commit to more effective and collaborative 
leadership by the government and the tech sector in the United 
What Is the Risk? 5
States to spearhead a strong and coordinated global cybersecu-
rity response,” according to Brad Smith, President of Microsoft 
(December 17, 2020) as posted on his blog about the SolarWinds 
attack. This attack was used to steal valuable intellectual prop-
erty from the top-tier security company FireEye. As of the time 
of this writing, it has been confirmed to have affected dozens 
of U.S. cabinet-level agencies. Due to the pervasiveness of the 
SolarWinds product across the world, more breaches will be 
discovered in the following days, weeks, months, and years to 
come. Some may never be discovered (or admitted); however, 
there will be international victims. It is a coup for the suspected 
perpetrators, thought to be a state actor who used a supply side 
attack, exploiting the weakness of a popular network and moni-
toring tool, SolarWinds, to circumvent the tight defenses of the 
intended victims.
On December 18th, Microsoft released information iden-
tifying more than 40 government agencies, higher learning 
institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and 
information technology companies that were infiltrated, with 
four-fifths of them being U.S.-based, and nearly half of those 
being tech companies. On his blog, Brad Smith said
This is not “espionage as usual,” even in the digital age. 
Instead, it represents an act of recklessness that created a 
serious technological vulnerability for the United States and 
the world. While the most recent attack appears to reflect 
a particular focus on the United States and many other 
democracies, it also provides a powerful reminder that peo-
ple in virtually every country are at risk and need protection 
irrespective of the governments they live under.
One act of recklessness that he refers to is that this pervasive 
software, SolarWinds Orion, was clearly not performing its own 
due diligence and due care to protect itself and its customers, 
6 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
and this product is used by nearly everyone. Further recklessness 
was that all the customers of SolarWinds were not performing at 
expectations for cybersecurity’s best practice.
If customers had performed some key cybersecurity assess-
ment on a third-party software maker like SolarWinds, this attack 
could have been detected. Were intake questions asked about the 
type of data to which SolarWinds had access and where that data 
might go or be stored? Depending on a company’s solution type, 
asking questions about how the secure software development life-
cycle is managed and audited is considered to be appropriate.
With the hardware device, what was SolarWind’s supply 
chain security for the hardware parts and assembly? For the 
company that had ventured to perform an on-site cybersecurity 
physical validation of SolarWinds, was any evidence produced 
on how they performed external security scans (which might 
have detected the default password on their download page 
“SolarWinds123”)? Who performed these external scans? The 
company? Or did they hire an outside firm and were the results 
viewable? Often, such companies will not share these results, so 
you must negotiate to at least see the T able of Contents, who 
performed such security scans, and when.
Final question: Had SolarWinds remediated all the find-
ings in the external security scan? While this is not the first time 
a breach has occurred, the scale of the SolarWinds breach will 
dwarf all others.
The VGCA Supply-Chain Attack
On December 17, 2020, ESET Research announced it had 
detected a large supply-chain attack against the digital signing 
authority of the government of Vietnam (ca.gov.vn), the website 
for the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA), 
What Is the Risk? 7
which is part of the Government Cipher Committee under the 
Ministry of Information and Communication. Vietnam has made 
the digital leap, and almost anyone in the country who requires 
a government service, product, or approval is required to use a 
digital signature. These e-signatures have the same authority and 
enforceability as a traditional paper document autograph accord-
ing to government decree.
The VGCA also develops and makes available for download 
a toolkit to automate the process of e-signatures. This toolkit 
is widely used by the government, private companies, and indi-
viduals. VGCA ’s website was hacked as early as July 23rd, and no 
later than August 16, 2020. The compromised toolkits contained 
malware known as PhantomNet, and SManager ESET confirms 
that the files were downloaded from the VGCA website directly, 
and not the result of a redirect from another location. While 
these infected files were not signed with proper digital certifi-
cates, it appears that prior files were not correctly signed either. 
This may have led to users not rejecting the improper digital 
certificates of the trojan-infected files because they behaved the 
same before the malware was added.
When an infected file was downloaded and run, the correct 
VGCA program ran along with the malware. This masqueraded 
the trojan to the end user because they saw the normal program 
running correctly, being unaware of the trojan or unlikely to look 
for it because the program appeared to be running normally. The 
file eT oken.exe extracted a Windows cabinet file (.cab), which 
was used as an archive file to support compression and maintain 
archive integrity. The file 7z.cab was the file that contained a 
backdoor for the attackers to exploit. The attackers went to great 
lengths to ensure that the backdoor ran, regardless of the user’s 
privileges on the device.
If the 7z.cab file was able to run as an administrator on 
the machine, the program wrote the backdoor to c:\Windows\
8 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
appatch\netapi32.dll, which then registered it as a service to 
ensure it kept running after any reboot. On a device that only 
allowed the file to run as a normal user, the install placed it in a 
temporary directory, but the program scheduled a task to ensure 
its persistence. ESET named this backdoor PhantomNet. They 
mentioned that the victim list included the Philippines, but no 
evidence was found of a delivery mechanism.
The trojan was determined to be a simple program, and 
according to the sophistication of the attack, it is likely there were 
other more malicious plugins added to exploit the backdoor. When 
the victim’s web configuration was determined, then it reached 
out to a command and control (C&C) server to get instructions. 
Communications with the C&C servers was done over HTTPS 
(secure, encrypted web traffic), and the attackers went to the trou-
ble of preventing the interception of traffic (i.e., man-in-the-mid-
dle attack on their own data) by using their own certificates.
Data analysis indicates that the malware was used for lateral 
movement. Once inside the computer, it enabled the attacker to 
move around the network for other data. The malware collected 
and transferred information about the computer, user accounts, 
and victim. In the post-attack forensics, no data was discovered 
nor was the goal of the attack.
ESET wrote on its website:
Conclusion: With the compromise of Able Desktop, the 
attack on WIZVERA VeraPort by Lazarus and the recent 
supply-chain attack on SolarWinds Orion, we see that sup-
ply-chain attacks are a quite common compromise vector 
for cyberespionage groups. In this specific case, they com-
promised the website of a Vietnamese certificate authority, 
in which users are likely to have a high level of trust. Supply-
chain attacks are typically hard to find, as the malicious code 
is generally hidden among a lot of legitimate code, making 
its discovery significantly more difficult.
What Is the Risk? 9
The Zyxel Backdoor Attack
On January 2, 2020, Zyxel (networking device maker) announced 
over 100,000 of their firewalls, VPN gateways, and access point 
controllers (i.e., Wi-Fi controllers) contained a hardcoded 
administrator backdoor account, which gives root-level access 
(i.e., a super administrator that can do anything on the device) 
on both the secure shell (SSH) and web administrator portal. 
This is on top of a previous similar incident with Zyxel in 2016, 
where they had a backdoor that allowed any user to escalate their 
account to root-level account privileges. This backdoor is still 
being exploited by botnets to this day, four years later.
A hardcoded backdoor root account is one that cannot be 
underestimated in how critical the security flaw is. When 
an account is built within the code of a product, it cannot 
be removed unless the code itself is changed or updated by 
the manufacturer. Additionally, the root account is what 
is referred to as a “super user,” which has privileges as an 
administrator. The products affected the manufacturers 
Advanced Threat Protection (i.e., firewall), Unified Secu-
rity Gateway (i.e., hybrid firewall/virtual private network 
[VPN] gateway), USG FLEX (i.e., hybrid firewall/VPN 
gateway), VPN, and NXC (i.e., Wi-Fi access point control-
ler) series. These devices formed the perimeter and internal 
security control points for thousands of companies world-
wide. The attacker’s ability to exploit these network devices 
most assuredly gives them lateral access into the victim’s 
network. At the time of this backdoor announcement, Zyxel 
offered patches for all of the products except for the NXC 
series; it is not producing a patch for another four months.
10 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
The hardcoded user account “zyfwp” and password 
“PrOw!N_fXp” were stored in visible plaintext (i.e., unencrypted 
or obfuscated). Dutch researchers reported that the password 
was clearly visible in the code binaries. Apparently the account 
had the root-level access to install firmware updates. In the pre-
vious 2016 incident, a hacker would’ve needed to already have a 
user account on the device to exploit it and to become a super 
user. In that instance, the root account is directly accessible on 
HTTPS (port 443) connection to the device.
According to Zyxel’s website, “A hardcoded credential vul-
nerability was identified in the ‘zyfwp’ user account in some 
Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to 
deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points 
through FTP .” A search on Shodan (a search engine that can find 
computers and devices connected to the internet) shows nearly 
30,000 of these devices deployed in Russia; 5,000  in T aiwan, 
Germany, and Finland; with nearly 3,000 in the United States.
Other Supply-Chain Attacks
Starting in early December 2020 and into early 2021 ( January 
2), there were four major third-party (supply-chain) attacks and 
vulnerabilities announced in the span of 20 days. These attacks 
or vulnerabilities went on for months or longer. Evidence in the Zyxel Patch Release
The expected patch release is April 2021. Until then, the 
only option for organizations is to unplug and replace the 
devices to ensure security posture.
What Is the Risk? 11
SolarWinds and Vietnam attacks pointed to advanced persistent 
threats launching into the weaponization of the supply chain. 
In two of the cases, the attacks were directed at nearly a whole 
country (Vietnam through the VGCA, and Mongolia through 
the Able Desktop). In three of the instances, the attackers were all 
APT s and were stealthy enough to remain undetected for months 
or longer. These attackers have seen what they can do with the 
weakest links—vendors—to get to a wide range of targets.
Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) at Fortune 
500 companies have spent billions of dollars in the last decade 
securing their networks from such breaches. Some great tools 
have been implemented, like Intrusion Detection/Prevention 
Systems (IDS, IPS), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Priv-
ileged Access Manager (PAM), Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM), and Security Operations Centers (also 
referred to as Cyber Fusion Centers) have been built to track 
and eliminate threats. However, the level of breaches in 2020 
continued to increase exponentially. The number of third-party 
breach instances grew because every company is some other 
company’s vendor. As the number of these breaches increased, it 
meant another vendor with hundreds, thousands, or millions of 
customers became a victim as well.
Public law enforcement is also sounding the alarm. On 
December 8, 2020, at the American Bankers Association (ABA) 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference, FBI Director Chris-
topher Wray stated, “The financial sector has the most robust 
cybersecurity of any industry,” which is why cybercriminals try 
third-party channels. Banks can also be affected by ransomware 
targeting third parties, a threat that Wray said “may be somewhat 
underestimated by a lot of people.” While he specifically called 
out financial firms, the same could be said of many other sectors, 
including aerospace, energy, technology, biotech, and others, 
which generally have excellent security on their own company’s 
12 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
assets. Most of the victims of the SolarWinds attack have been in 
the technology and government sectors, which typically have had 
good-to-excellent security. In those cases, hackers will target the 
weakest link, attacking vendors who take security less seriously.
Hundreds of examples like this have occurred over the last 
decade, across the world, and in every industry: Ticketmaster, 
Capital One, T esla, Under Armor, Boeing, PayPal, Chubb, nearly 
every major worldwide automaker, Sears, Best Buy, Entercom, 
and T-Mobile. In the case of FireEye or a customer of Zyxel, 
these companies lost protected data as a result of a third (or 
fourth) party. No one in the public realm remembers that third 
party; they simply remember the company they trusted with their 
data who let them down. Such breaches cost these companies 
large amounts of money, which directly affected consumers, and 
extensively damaged the companies’ reputations. In areas where 
there was a heavy regulatory presence, the breached firms were 
often left holding fines as well. In August 2020, the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) assessed an $80 million 
civil penalty against Capital One for failure to establish effective 
risk assessment processes prior to migrating significant informa-
tion technology operations to its public cloud environment. It is 
expected to cost Capital One up to $150 million, and it cost the 
company’s CISO his job at the firm.
Problem Scope
The secret is out: If you want to attain protected data as a hacker, 
you do not attack a big company or organization that likely has 
good security. You go after a third party that more likely does 
not. Companies have created the equivalent of how to deter car 
thieves: Ensure that your car looks difficult enough to break into 
so that thieves move onto the automobile with its doors unlocked 
What Is the Risk? 13
and keys in the ignition. When a burglar sees a car with a car 
alarm, they know that they can look and eventually find a target 
that isn’t so well protected. Exploiting the weakest link is not 
new. A bank robber could go to the bank to steal money, but a 
softer target would likely be the courier service as it brings the 
money into and out of the bank.
T o date, cybersecurity and third-party risk teams have not 
often collaborated or understood the common threat, instead 
focusing their security on their own silos. In most regulated 
industries, this has led to the typical rush to the bottom to meet 
the regulatory requirements; meaning, rather than create a secu-
rity program that secures their data and network, they do just 
enough to keep the regulators happy. Regulators are never con-
sidered to be on the leading edge. Whether it is in financial fraud 
or cybercrime, they simply do not lead in best practices for any 
field. However, it is not their responsibility. Regulations are typi-
cally designed to limit the behavior of a company that may cause 
financial or bodily harm. The most highly regulated industries, 
such as energy, biotechnology, finance, telecommunications, aer -
ospace, and many others, have robust Third-Party Risk Manage-
ment and cybersecurity teams. However, if these industries rely 
on doing what the regulators require of them, they are not going 
to be performing their best practices.
The most successful companies at preventing their systems 
from being compromised go beyond what a regulator or reg-
ulation mandates them to do for compliance. The regulations 
and their enforcers get involved after something bad has already 
occurred. Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) was a financial regulation 
designed to lower the risk of financial fraud by publicly traded 
companies after the damage done by the tech bubble crash in 
the early 2000s. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act was passed in 2010 after the financial melt-
down leading to the Great Recession. These widespread changes 
14 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
in regulation occurred as a reaction to the excesses and missteps 
that lawmakers felt led to the meltdown. Nearly every regulation 
passed is due to a previous misstep, not in anticipation of the next 
misstep or mistake
Being reliant on the government to set the standard for what 
to do and how to do it is a recipe for disaster. This is not to say, 
however, that regulations are without their merit when enforced 
correctly. The argument here is not about whether there should 
be regulations, but more about if organizations should be advised 
to view those regulations as the bare minimum to perform. In the 
case of cybersecurity and third-party risk, regulations provide 
some excellent guidance on what is important for organizations. 
However, if a cybersecurity or third-party risk team only relies 
on regulators for the best practical procedures to follow, there’s a 
high likelihood their companies will be hacked. In fact, the likeli-
hood is that they will be hacked quite a bit faster than those com-
panies that view regulatory requirements as their starting point.
T o illustrate the point, we can look at the Payment Card 
Industry Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is the payment 
card standard (using credit and debit cards), to guarantee con-
sumer financial data protection. PCI-DSS has very specific 
recommendations and is regularly updated for how to secure 
networks, protect user data, require strong access controls, per -
form network security tests, and regularly review information 
security policies. PCI-DSS is tested regularly, and its standards 
are considered rigorous. It is not regulated by the government; 
instead, it’s a group of companies that standardized their prac-
tices. Meaning, private companies collaborated to create what is 
nationally viewed as a success in security.
Third-party risk, or what another company is doing to lower 
risk to your company, might seem like it places a CISO and the 
cybersecurity organization at a disadvantage because they cannot 
control what goes on at another entity. However, that is a myth. 
What Is the Risk? 15
While a third party cannot be directly controlled, there are ways 
to direct and monitor their behavior and choices to greatly reduce 
your risk. Anyone who has ever been taught risk or worked as 
a risk professional knows the mantra: Risk can never be zero. 
In fact, anything is possible. Regardless of whether your com-
pany is using all the fancy technology and expensive software, or 
employing hundreds of cybersecurity professionals hunting for 
vulnerabilities, there still is a chance, or risk, of a breach.
The goal is reduce risk to a level that is commensurate with 
your company’s effort to reduce it, based upon its risk appetite. 
This risk reduction effort of a third party requires a change in a 
company’s cybersecurity approach and attitude. As we dive into 
the numbers, it will become apparent that not enough companies 
perform the required due diligence. Out of those that do, some do 
not perform it at the level necessary to reduce the risk. Often, risk 
reduction is performed as a compliance effort, and merely viewed 
as a checkbox to complete in order to keep regulators and auditors 
at bay. This attitude of “ignoring the risk” or “doing it as ‘check-
box’ security” has caused cybersecurity Third-Party Risk Manage-
ment (TPRM) to be absent from adequate attention and activity.
Compliance Does Not Equal Security
Compliance is not security, yet security is an important piece of 
compliance. By definition, being compliant is when your organiza-
tion meets the minimum requirements for specific regulations at 
a specific moment in time. If we look at many of the companies 
on the recently breached list, it’s likely all were meeting their 
regulatory obligations for compliance in their respective indus-
tries. In the case of T arget when its payment system was hacked, 
it had just completed a certification of its PCI-DSS. Most regu-
lations are simply a form of deterrence (of things like insider 
16 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
trading or dumping chemicals into a river). Regulations discour -
age bad behavior either by people or companies.
Security is an ongoing activity—a continuously occurring 
activity and not one that occurs at a point in time. Compliance 
activities are performed as a checklist by internal or external 
auditors to verify that a company’s team is following regulations. 
It’s is an important activity that helps prevent bad acts. Employ-
ees and companies see these checks being performed, then are 
discouraged from doing bad things, such as ill-gotten gains via 
insider trading or killing fish by dumping chemicals. Security has 
the dubious distinction of being sure data is not lost. Once data is 
lost, it cannot be retrieved—it is gone forever into the Dark Web 
or other places. The deterrent must come from the company’s 
cybersecurity efforts, not the government regulators.
A company can be 100-percent compliant and also be 
100-percent owned by hackers. For example, you can drive a car 
with seatbelts, an automatic brake system (ABS), collision detec-
tion and avoidance, blind spot detection, and more, all turned on. 
Say your car is up to current safety regulations, you, the driver, 
are all buckled up and sober. There should be no accidents or 
injuries. Yet, another driver who doesn’t always pay attention to 
the safety warnings fails to perform their best practices while 
driving, resulting in a collision with injuries. You, a driver, were 
100-percent compliant, yet another driver was not.
Another difference in compliance activities is the timing of 
each action. Compliance activities are done at a certain point in 
time for what is present in terms of controls and checks. Another 
third party (i.e., auditors, regulators) or an internal team ensures 
that the company they’re working with satisfies a set of require-
ments that allows it to continue to perform business. When all 
conditions have been satisfied, the compliance activity is finished. 
Security, however, is never finished. It is continually monitored, 
reviewed, and improved.

Third-Party Breach Examples
Throughout many chapters in this book, you will find case study 
sections where we dive into some of these breaches. However, it 
is important to understand the scope and history of how often 
third-party incidents occur. Many public breaches attributed to 
a particular company are, in fact, the result of a third party. One 
of the most well-known examples is the T arget breach. In fact, it 
was T arget’s Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) 
provider that was breached to get access to T arget’s data.
Following are a few examples of the major third-party 
breaches to show how easily they cross over any boundary (i.e., 
geographic, sectors, sizes):

24 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
According to a Ponemon Institute survey in 2019, 60 per -
cent of the companies surveyed admitted to not performing 
adequate cybersecurity vetting of their third parties. Thirty-
three percent replied they had no or an ad-hoc cybersecurity 
vetting process. Fifty-nine percent admitted being affected by 
a third-party breach in the previous year. In that same survey, 
the companies also admitted to sharing their data on average 
with and requiring protection from a whopping 588 third par -
ties. Following those numbers, this means over half the com-
panies admitted to not performing their cybersecurity due 
diligence on nearly 600 third parties. Note, these statistics are 
pre-COVID-19 pandemic. However, post pandemic, the cyber -
attack increase was over 800 percent, according to the FBI as of 
May 2020. Prior to the pandemic, the problem was pronounced, 
with the breaches listed including Capital One, Home Depot, 
and others. However, the lack of due diligence and programs to 
review the cybersecurity of third parties by so many firms led 
to an explosion of breaches. And, as everyone is someone else’s 
third party (i.e., every company is selling to someone and using 
vendors to assist in that effort), the problem was magnified to a 
boiling point.
Third-Party Risk Management
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) as a discipline is not 
very old. In the financial sector, it was not mandated by the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) until 2013, when it 
regulated that all banks must manage the risk of all their third 
parties. OCC 2013-29 defined “third party” as any entity a com-
pany does business with, including vendors, suppliers, partners, 
affiliates, brokers, manufacturers, and agents. Third parties can 
include upstream (i.e., vendors) and downstream (i.e., resellers) 
and non-contractual parties. Other regulated sectors have seen 
similar requirements, often indirectly via privacy regulations. For 
What Is the Risk? 25
example, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the 
California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) require many companies 
subject to these regulations to perform due diligence on vendors 
who have access to their customer data. This may not lead to a 
full-blown risk management division or group, but someone will 
be required to perform some oversight in an organized process, 
lest they get subjected to the extreme financial penalties both 
regulations require.
Other risk domains exist in TPRM: strategic, reputation, 
operational, transaction, and compliance domains. Why is the 
focus in this book on the cybersecurity domain exclusively? 
That is where the money is. While there are financial and repu-
tational risks for the other domains, none of them provide the 
level of risk to a firm such as the risk of information security. 
As described previously, there are number of breaches that can 
be directly attributed to a cybersecurity breach at a vendor. It 
is not that these other domains aren’t important, but none of 
them have the impact that a cybersecurity risk poses to a firm, 
financially or reputationally. Perform an internet search on the 
other domains, and you will struggle to find results. A similar 
search on cybersecurity breaches produces more results than 
one can list in a single page. Like any organization with more 
than one domain, if one of those domains presents a higher risk 
for practitioners, and evidence shows that Information Secu-
rity does, then that domain needs more research, resources, 
and results.
While TRPM organizations struggle to keep up with the 
level of breaches and incidents with vendors, evidence shows most 
cybersecurity organizations are not taking a lead in this domain, 
and that TPRM groups do not have the expertise to address 
this gap. According to the Ponemon Institute “Data Risk in the 
Third-Party Ecosystem” study (2018), only 40 percent perform 
any cybersecurity due diligence. Sixty percent perform none or 
only ad-hoc cybersecurity reviews. The evidence indicates that 
26 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
a large percent of the 40 percent (i.e., those that perform some 
cybersecurity due diligence) do not do enough (as evidenced by 
the level of breaches/incidents). TPRM organizations must begin 
focusing more on the Information Security domain, and either 
directly bring cybersecurity experts into their organizations or 
partner with cybersecurity teams to address the gap. Doing so 
will also require that a cybersecurity team is able to understand 
the problem with third parties and address the risk.
While the fines and publicity for failure to follow TPRM 
guidelines are not as big, instances of regulators acting can be  
found:
• In 2020, the OCC assessed an $85 million civil money pen-
alty against USAA for failure to implement and maintain an 
effective risk management compliance.
• In 2020, the OCC assessed a $60 million civil money penalty 
against Morgan Stanley for not properly decommissioning 
some Wealth Management business data centers.
• In 2020, the OCC assessed a $400 million civil money penalty 
against Citibank for failures in enterprise risk management.
• In 2020, the Federal Reserve announced an enforcement 
action against Citigroup Inc., requiring that the firm cor -
rect several longstanding deficiencies.
• In 2020, the OCC assessed an $80  million civil money 
penalty against Capital One for not establishing an effec-
tive risk assessment process, which led to the breach in its 
public cloud.
• In 2013, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
lowered the burden of proof for proxy disclosure enhance-
ments on risk management inadequacy from fraud to simply 
negligence. This means that boards of directors and senior

The post explains that HyperbBro is commonly attributed 
to the cybercriminal group named “LuckyMouse,” a Chinese-  
speaking threat actor known for highly targeted cyberattacks. 
Primarily active in South East and Central Asia, many of their 
attacks have a political aim. Tmanger is attributed to TA428, also 
a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. Because these 
two applications are used normally by different APT s and are now 
together in one attack, the ESET team theorizes that LuckyMouse 
and TA428 are sharing data and weapons; they are also likely the 
subgroup of a larger APT. Given the region and threat actors, it is 
considered to be a political attack that had been planned as early 
as May 2018, yet not carried out in earnest until two years later.
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is the term given to 
state actors (i.e., government run or authorized hackers) or 
large cybercriminal syndicates that have a lot of time and 
patience to perform very stealthy, large-scale attacks aimed 
at political or economic goals.
4 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
The SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack
On December 13, 2020, FireEye, a global leader in cybersecurity, 
publishes on its website the first details about the SolarWinds 
Supply-Chain Attack, a global intrusion campaign inserting a 
trojan into the SolarWinds Orion business software updates to 
distribute the malware. FireEye names the malware  “Sunburst.” 
After the attackers successfully hacked into FireEye, their 
 activity demonstrated lateral movement and data exfiltration. 
“The actors behind this campaign gained access to numerous 
public and private organizations around the world. . . . This cam-
paign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently 
ongoing. . . . The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor 
and the operation was conducted with significant operational 
security,” as explained in the Summary from FireEye’s website 
on December 13th.
The attackers added a .dll file (a configuration file) called 
SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll to the Orion prod-
uct, which had been digitally signed and enabled backdoor com-
munications over HTTP (i.e., normal, unencrypted web traffic), 
to other servers. The Sunburst malware is suspected to have lain 
quietly for two weeks, while it performed some reconnaissance 
via executing commands that led to file transfers and to control-
ling the victim’s servers (i.e., reboots, disabling services). Using a 
native product within Orion, the Orion Improvement Program 
(OIP), Sunburst blended in with the program’s normal functions 
expertly. It even had the capability to sniff out the antivirus and 
cybersecurity forensic tools being used, likely to learn how to 
better go undetected.
“As much as anything, this attack provides a moment of 
reckoning. It requires that we look with clear eyes at the growing 
threats we face and commit to more effective and collaborative 
leadership by the government and the tech sector in the United 
What Is the Risk? 5
States to spearhead a strong and coordinated global cybersecu-
rity response,” according to Brad Smith, President of Microsoft 
(December 17, 2020) as posted on his blog about the SolarWinds 
attack. This attack was used to steal valuable intellectual prop-
erty from the top-tier security company FireEye. As of the time 
of this writing, it has been confirmed to have affected dozens 
of U.S. cabinet-level agencies. Due to the pervasiveness of the 
SolarWinds product across the world, more breaches will be 
discovered in the following days, weeks, months, and years to 
come. Some may never be discovered (or admitted); however, 
there will be international victims. It is a coup for the suspected 
perpetrators, thought to be a state actor who used a supply side 
attack, exploiting the weakness of a popular network and moni-
toring tool, SolarWinds, to circumvent the tight defenses of the 
intended victims.
On December 18th, Microsoft released information iden-
tifying more than 40 government agencies, higher learning 
institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and 
information technology companies that were infiltrated, with 
four-fifths of them being U.S.-based, and nearly half of those 
being tech companies. On his blog, Brad Smith said
This is not “espionage as usual,” even in the digital age. 
Instead, it represents an act of recklessness that created a 
serious technological vulnerability for the United States and 
the world. While the most recent attack appears to reflect 
a particular focus on the United States and many other 
democracies, it also provides a powerful reminder that peo-
ple in virtually every country are at risk and need protection 
irrespective of the governments they live under.
One act of recklessness that he refers to is that this pervasive 
software, SolarWinds Orion, was clearly not performing its own 
due diligence and due care to protect itself and its customers, 
6 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
and this product is used by nearly everyone. Further recklessness 
was that all the customers of SolarWinds were not performing at 
expectations for cybersecurity’s best practice.
If customers had performed some key cybersecurity assess-
ment on a third-party software maker like SolarWinds, this attack 
could have been detected. Were intake questions asked about the 
type of data to which SolarWinds had access and where that data 
might go or be stored? Depending on a company’s solution type, 
asking questions about how the secure software development life-
cycle is managed and audited is considered to be appropriate.
With the hardware device, what was SolarWind’s supply 
chain security for the hardware parts and assembly? For the 
company that had ventured to perform an on-site cybersecurity 
physical validation of SolarWinds, was any evidence produced 
on how they performed external security scans (which might 
have detected the default password on their download page 
“SolarWinds123”)? Who performed these external scans? The 
company? Or did they hire an outside firm and were the results 
viewable? Often, such companies will not share these results, so 
you must negotiate to at least see the T able of Contents, who 
performed such security scans, and when.
Final question: Had SolarWinds remediated all the find-
ings in the external security scan? While this is not the first time 
a breach has occurred, the scale of the SolarWinds breach will 
dwarf all others.
The VGCA Supply-Chain Attack
On December 17, 2020, ESET Research announced it had 
detected a large supply-chain attack against the digital signing 
authority of the government of Vietnam (ca.gov.vn), the website 
for the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA), 
What Is the Risk? 7
which is part of the Government Cipher Committee under the 
Ministry of Information and Communication. Vietnam has made 
the digital leap, and almost anyone in the country who requires 
a government service, product, or approval is required to use a 
digital signature. These e-signatures have the same authority and 
enforceability as a traditional paper document autograph accord-
ing to government decree.
The VGCA also develops and makes available for download 
a toolkit to automate the process of e-signatures. This toolkit 
is widely used by the government, private companies, and indi-
viduals. VGCA ’s website was hacked as early as July 23rd, and no 
later than August 16, 2020. The compromised toolkits contained 
malware known as PhantomNet, and SManager ESET confirms 
that the files were downloaded from the VGCA website directly, 
and not the result of a redirect from another location. While 
these infected files were not signed with proper digital certifi-
cates, it appears that prior files were not correctly signed either. 
This may have led to users not rejecting the improper digital 
certificates of the trojan-infected files because they behaved the 
same before the malware was added.
When an infected file was downloaded and run, the correct 
VGCA program ran along with the malware. This masqueraded 
the trojan to the end user because they saw the normal program 
running correctly, being unaware of the trojan or unlikely to look 
for it because the program appeared to be running normally. The 
file eT oken.exe extracted a Windows cabinet file (.cab), which 
was used as an archive file to support compression and maintain 
archive integrity. The file 7z.cab was the file that contained a 
backdoor for the attackers to exploit. The attackers went to great 
lengths to ensure that the backdoor ran, regardless of the user’s 
privileges on the device.
If the 7z.cab file was able to run as an administrator on 
the machine, the program wrote the backdoor to c:\Windows\
8 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
appatch\netapi32.dll, which then registered it as a service to 
ensure it kept running after any reboot. On a device that only 
allowed the file to run as a normal user, the install placed it in a 
temporary directory, but the program scheduled a task to ensure 
its persistence. ESET named this backdoor PhantomNet. They 
mentioned that the victim list included the Philippines, but no 
evidence was found of a delivery mechanism.
The trojan was determined to be a simple program, and 
according to the sophistication of the attack, it is likely there were 
other more malicious plugins added to exploit the backdoor. When 
the victim’s web configuration was determined, then it reached 
out to a command and control (C&C) server to get instructions. 
Communications with the C&C servers was done over HTTPS 
(secure, encrypted web traffic), and the attackers went to the trou-
ble of preventing the interception of traffic (i.e., man-in-the-mid-
dle attack on their own data) by using their own certificates.
Data analysis indicates that the malware was used for lateral 
movement. Once inside the computer, it enabled the attacker to 
move around the network for other data. The malware collected 
and transferred information about the computer, user accounts, 
and victim. In the post-attack forensics, no data was discovered 
nor was the goal of the attack.
ESET wrote on its website:
Conclusion: With the compromise of Able Desktop, the 
attack on WIZVERA VeraPort by Lazarus and the recent 
supply-chain attack on SolarWinds Orion, we see that sup-
ply-chain attacks are a quite common compromise vector 
for cyberespionage groups. In this specific case, they com-
promised the website of a Vietnamese certificate authority, 
in which users are likely to have a high level of trust. Supply-
chain attacks are typically hard to find, as the malicious code 
is generally hidden among a lot of legitimate code, making 
its discovery significantly more difficult.
What Is the Risk? 9
The Zyxel Backdoor Attack
On January 2, 2020, Zyxel (networking device maker) announced 
over 100,000 of their firewalls, VPN gateways, and access point 
controllers (i.e., Wi-Fi controllers) contained a hardcoded 
administrator backdoor account, which gives root-level access 
(i.e., a super administrator that can do anything on the device) 
on both the secure shell (SSH) and web administrator portal. 
This is on top of a previous similar incident with Zyxel in 2016, 
where they had a backdoor that allowed any user to escalate their 
account to root-level account privileges. This backdoor is still 
being exploited by botnets to this day, four years later.
A hardcoded backdoor root account is one that cannot be 
underestimated in how critical the security flaw is. When 
an account is built within the code of a product, it cannot 
be removed unless the code itself is changed or updated by 
the manufacturer. Additionally, the root account is what 
is referred to as a “super user,” which has privileges as an 
administrator. The products affected the manufacturers 
Advanced Threat Protection (i.e., firewall), Unified Secu-
rity Gateway (i.e., hybrid firewall/virtual private network 
[VPN] gateway), USG FLEX (i.e., hybrid firewall/VPN 
gateway), VPN, and NXC (i.e., Wi-Fi access point control-
ler) series. These devices formed the perimeter and internal 
security control points for thousands of companies world-
wide. The attacker’s ability to exploit these network devices 
most assuredly gives them lateral access into the victim’s 
network. At the time of this backdoor announcement, Zyxel 
offered patches for all of the products except for the NXC 
series; it is not producing a patch for another four months.
10 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
The hardcoded user account “zyfwp” and password 
“PrOw!N_fXp” were stored in visible plaintext (i.e., unencrypted 
or obfuscated). Dutch researchers reported that the password 
was clearly visible in the code binaries. Apparently the account 
had the root-level access to install firmware updates. In the pre-
vious 2016 incident, a hacker would’ve needed to already have a 
user account on the device to exploit it and to become a super 
user. In that instance, the root account is directly accessible on 
HTTPS (port 443) connection to the device.
According to Zyxel’s website, “A hardcoded credential vul-
nerability was identified in the ‘zyfwp’ user account in some 
Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to 
deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points 
through FTP .” A search on Shodan (a search engine that can find 
computers and devices connected to the internet) shows nearly 
30,000 of these devices deployed in Russia; 5,000  in T aiwan, 
Germany, and Finland; with nearly 3,000 in the United States.
Other Supply-Chain Attacks
Starting in early December 2020 and into early 2021 ( January 
2), there were four major third-party (supply-chain) attacks and 
vulnerabilities announced in the span of 20 days. These attacks 
or vulnerabilities went on for months or longer. Evidence in the Zyxel Patch Release
The expected patch release is April 2021. Until then, the 
only option for organizations is to unplug and replace the 
devices to ensure security posture.
What Is the Risk? 11
SolarWinds and Vietnam attacks pointed to advanced persistent 
threats launching into the weaponization of the supply chain. 
In two of the cases, the attacks were directed at nearly a whole 
country (Vietnam through the VGCA, and Mongolia through 
the Able Desktop). In three of the instances, the attackers were all 
APT s and were stealthy enough to remain undetected for months 
or longer. These attackers have seen what they can do with the 
weakest links—vendors—to get to a wide range of targets.
Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) at Fortune 
500 companies have spent billions of dollars in the last decade 
securing their networks from such breaches. Some great tools 
have been implemented, like Intrusion Detection/Prevention 
Systems (IDS, IPS), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Priv-
ileged Access Manager (PAM), Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM), and Security Operations Centers (also 
referred to as Cyber Fusion Centers) have been built to track 
and eliminate threats. However, the level of breaches in 2020 
continued to increase exponentially. The number of third-party 
breach instances grew because every company is some other 
company’s vendor. As the number of these breaches increased, it 
meant another vendor with hundreds, thousands, or millions of 
customers became a victim as well.
Public law enforcement is also sounding the alarm. On 
December 8, 2020, at the American Bankers Association (ABA) 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference, FBI Director Chris-
topher Wray stated, “The financial sector has the most robust 
cybersecurity of any industry,” which is why cybercriminals try 
third-party channels. Banks can also be affected by ransomware 
targeting third parties, a threat that Wray said “may be somewhat 
underestimated by a lot of people.” While he specifically called 
out financial firms, the same could be said of many other sectors, 
including aerospace, energy, technology, biotech, and others, 
which generally have excellent security on their own company’s 
12 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
assets. Most of the victims of the SolarWinds attack have been in 
the technology and government sectors, which typically have had 
good-to-excellent security. In those cases, hackers will target the 
weakest link, attacking vendors who take security less seriously.
Hundreds of examples like this have occurred over the last 
decade, across the world, and in every industry: Ticketmaster, 
Capital One, T esla, Under Armor, Boeing, PayPal, Chubb, nearly 
every major worldwide automaker, Sears, Best Buy, Entercom, 
and T-Mobile. In the case of FireEye or a customer of Zyxel, 
these companies lost protected data as a result of a third (or 
fourth) party. No one in the public realm remembers that third 
party; they simply remember the company they trusted with their 
data who let them down. Such breaches cost these companies 
large amounts of money, which directly affected consumers, and 
extensively damaged the companies’ reputations. In areas where 
there was a heavy regulatory presence, the breached firms were 
often left holding fines as well. In August 2020, the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) assessed an $80 million 
civil penalty against Capital One for failure to establish effective 
risk assessment processes prior to migrating significant informa-
tion technology operations to its public cloud environment. It is 
expected to cost Capital One up to $150 million, and it cost the 
company’s CISO his job at the firm.
Problem Scope
The secret is out: If you want to attain protected data as a hacker, 
you do not attack a big company or organization that likely has 
good security. You go after a third party that more likely does 
not. Companies have created the equivalent of how to deter car 
thieves: Ensure that your car looks difficult enough to break into 
so that thieves move onto the automobile with its doors unlocked 
What Is the Risk? 13
and keys in the ignition. When a burglar sees a car with a car 
alarm, they know that they can look and eventually find a target 
that isn’t so well protected. Exploiting the weakest link is not 
new. A bank robber could go to the bank to steal money, but a 
softer target would likely be the courier service as it brings the 
money into and out of the bank.
T o date, cybersecurity and third-party risk teams have not 
often collaborated or understood the common threat, instead 
focusing their security on their own silos. In most regulated 
industries, this has led to the typical rush to the bottom to meet 
the regulatory requirements; meaning, rather than create a secu-
rity program that secures their data and network, they do just 
enough to keep the regulators happy. Regulators are never con-
sidered to be on the leading edge. Whether it is in financial fraud 
or cybercrime, they simply do not lead in best practices for any 
field. However, it is not their responsibility. Regulations are typi-
cally designed to limit the behavior of a company that may cause 
financial or bodily harm. The most highly regulated industries, 
such as energy, biotechnology, finance, telecommunications, aer -
ospace, and many others, have robust Third-Party Risk Manage-
ment and cybersecurity teams. However, if these industries rely 
on doing what the regulators require of them, they are not going 
to be performing their best practices.
The most successful companies at preventing their systems 
from being compromised go beyond what a regulator or reg-
ulation mandates them to do for compliance. The regulations 
and their enforcers get involved after something bad has already 
occurred. Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) was a financial regulation 
designed to lower the risk of financial fraud by publicly traded 
companies after the damage done by the tech bubble crash in 
the early 2000s. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act was passed in 2010 after the financial melt-
down leading to the Great Recession. These widespread changes 
14 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
in regulation occurred as a reaction to the excesses and missteps 
that lawmakers felt led to the meltdown. Nearly every regulation 
passed is due to a previous misstep, not in anticipation of the next 
misstep or mistake
Being reliant on the government to set the standard for what 
to do and how to do it is a recipe for disaster. This is not to say, 
however, that regulations are without their merit when enforced 
correctly. The argument here is not about whether there should 
be regulations, but more about if organizations should be advised 
to view those regulations as the bare minimum to perform. In the 
case of cybersecurity and third-party risk, regulations provide 
some excellent guidance on what is important for organizations. 
However, if a cybersecurity or third-party risk team only relies 
on regulators for the best practical procedures to follow, there’s a 
high likelihood their companies will be hacked. In fact, the likeli-
hood is that they will be hacked quite a bit faster than those com-
panies that view regulatory requirements as their starting point.
T o illustrate the point, we can look at the Payment Card 
Industry Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is the payment 
card standard (using credit and debit cards), to guarantee con-
sumer financial data protection. PCI-DSS has very specific 
recommendations and is regularly updated for how to secure 
networks, protect user data, require strong access controls, per -
form network security tests, and regularly review information 
security policies. PCI-DSS is tested regularly, and its standards 
are considered rigorous. It is not regulated by the government; 
instead, it’s a group of companies that standardized their prac-
tices. Meaning, private companies collaborated to create what is 
nationally viewed as a success in security.
Third-party risk, or what another company is doing to lower 
risk to your company, might seem like it places a CISO and the 
cybersecurity organization at a disadvantage because they cannot 
control what goes on at another entity. However, that is a myth. 
What Is the Risk? 15
While a third party cannot be directly controlled, there are ways 
to direct and monitor their behavior and choices to greatly reduce 
your risk. Anyone who has ever been taught risk or worked as 
a risk professional knows the mantra: Risk can never be zero. 
In fact, anything is possible. Regardless of whether your com-
pany is using all the fancy technology and expensive software, or 
employing hundreds of cybersecurity professionals hunting for 
vulnerabilities, there still is a chance, or risk, of a breach.
The goal is reduce risk to a level that is commensurate with 
your company’s effort to reduce it, based upon its risk appetite. 
This risk reduction effort of a third party requires a change in a 
company’s cybersecurity approach and attitude. As we dive into 
the numbers, it will become apparent that not enough companies 
perform the required due diligence. Out of those that do, some do 
not perform it at the level necessary to reduce the risk. Often, risk 
reduction is performed as a compliance effort, and merely viewed 
as a checkbox to complete in order to keep regulators and auditors 
at bay. This attitude of “ignoring the risk” or “doing it as ‘check-
box’ security” has caused cybersecurity Third-Party Risk Manage-
ment (TPRM) to be absent from adequate attention and activity.
Compliance Does Not Equal Security
Compliance is not security, yet security is an important piece of 
compliance. By definition, being compliant is when your organiza-
tion meets the minimum requirements for specific regulations at 
a specific moment in time. If we look at many of the companies 
on the recently breached list, it’s likely all were meeting their 
regulatory obligations for compliance in their respective indus-
tries. In the case of T arget when its payment system was hacked, 
it had just completed a certification of its PCI-DSS. Most regu-
lations are simply a form of deterrence (of things like insider 
16 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
trading or dumping chemicals into a river). Regulations discour -
age bad behavior either by people or companies.
Security is an ongoing activity—a continuously occurring 
activity and not one that occurs at a point in time. Compliance 
activities are performed as a checklist by internal or external 
auditors to verify that a company’s team is following regulations. 
It’s is an important activity that helps prevent bad acts. Employ-
ees and companies see these checks being performed, then are 
discouraged from doing bad things, such as ill-gotten gains via 
insider trading or killing fish by dumping chemicals. Security has 
the dubious distinction of being sure data is not lost. Once data is 
lost, it cannot be retrieved—it is gone forever into the Dark Web 
or other places. The deterrent must come from the company’s 
cybersecurity efforts, not the government regulators.
A company can be 100-percent compliant and also be 
100-percent owned by hackers. For example, you can drive a car 
with seatbelts, an automatic brake system (ABS), collision detec-
tion and avoidance, blind spot detection, and more, all turned on. 
Say your car is up to current safety regulations, you, the driver, 
are all buckled up and sober. There should be no accidents or 
injuries. Yet, another driver who doesn’t always pay attention to 
the safety warnings fails to perform their best practices while 
driving, resulting in a collision with injuries. You, a driver, were 
100-percent compliant, yet another driver was not.
Another difference in compliance activities is the timing of 
each action. Compliance activities are done at a certain point in 
time for what is present in terms of controls and checks. Another 
third party (i.e., auditors, regulators) or an internal team ensures 
that the company they’re working with satisfies a set of require-
ments that allows it to continue to perform business. When all 
conditions have been satisfied, the compliance activity is finished. 
Security, however, is never finished. It is continually monitored, 
reviewed, and improved.

Third-Party Breach Examples
Throughout many chapters in this book, you will find case study 
sections where we dive into some of these breaches. However, it 
is important to understand the scope and history of how often 
third-party incidents occur. Many public breaches attributed to 
a particular company are, in fact, the result of a third party. One 
of the most well-known examples is the T arget breach. In fact, it 
was T arget’s Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) 
provider that was breached to get access to T arget’s data.
Following are a few examples of the major third-party 
breaches to show how easily they cross over any boundary (i.e.,

24 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
According to a Ponemon Institute survey in 2019, 60 per -
cent of the companies surveyed admitted to not performing 
adequate cybersecurity vetting of their third parties. Thirty-
three percent replied they had no or an ad-hoc cybersecurity 
vetting process. Fifty-nine percent admitted being affected by 
a third-party breach in the previous year. In that same survey, 
the companies also admitted to sharing their data on average 
with and requiring protection from a whopping 588 third par -
ties. Following those numbers, this means over half the com-
panies admitted to not performing their cybersecurity due 
diligence on nearly 600 third parties. Note, these statistics are 
pre-COVID-19 pandemic. However, post pandemic, the cyber -
attack increase was over 800 percent, according to the FBI as of 
May 2020. Prior to the pandemic, the problem was pronounced, 
with the breaches listed including Capital One, Home Depot, 
and others. However, the lack of due diligence and programs to 
review the cybersecurity of third parties by so many firms led 
to an explosion of breaches. And, as everyone is someone else’s 
third party (i.e., every company is selling to someone and using 
vendors to assist in that effort), the problem was magnified to a 
boiling point.
Third-Party Risk Management
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) as a discipline is not 
very old. In the financial sector, it was not mandated by the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) until 2013, when it 
regulated that all banks must manage the risk of all their third 
parties. OCC 2013-29 defined “third party” as any entity a com-
pany does business with, including vendors, suppliers, partners, 
affiliates, brokers, manufacturers, and agents. Third parties can 
include upstream (i.e., vendors) and downstream (i.e., resellers) 
and non-contractual parties. Other regulated sectors have seen 
similar requirements, often indirectly via privacy regulations. For 
What Is the Risk? 25
example, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the 
California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) require many companies 
subject to these regulations to perform due diligence on vendors 
who have access to their customer data. This may not lead to a 
full-blown risk management division or group, but someone will 
be required to perform some oversight in an organized process, 
lest they get subjected to the extreme financial penalties both 
regulations require.
Other risk domains exist in TPRM: strategic, reputation, 
operational, transaction, and compliance domains. Why is the 
focus in this book on the cybersecurity domain exclusively? 
That is where the money is. While there are financial and repu-
tational risks for the other domains, none of them provide the 
level of risk to a firm such as the risk of information security. 
As described previously, there are number of breaches that can 
be directly attributed to a cybersecurity breach at a vendor. It 
is not that these other domains aren’t important, but none of 
them have the impact that a cybersecurity risk poses to a firm, 
financially or reputationally. Perform an internet search on the 
other domains, and you will struggle to find results. A similar 
search on cybersecurity breaches produces more results than 
one can list in a single page. Like any organization with more 
than one domain, if one of those domains presents a higher risk 
for practitioners, and evidence shows that Information Secu-
rity does, then that domain needs more research, resources, 
and results.
While TRPM organizations struggle to keep up with the 
level of breaches and incidents with vendors, evidence shows most 
cybersecurity organizations are not taking a lead in this domain, 
and that TPRM groups do not have the expertise to address 
this gap. According to the Ponemon Institute “Data Risk in the 
Third-Party Ecosystem” study (2018), only 40 percent perform 
any cybersecurity due diligence. Sixty percent perform none or 
only ad-hoc cybersecurity reviews. The evidence indicates that 
26 CYBERSECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY RISK
a large percent of the 40 percent (i.e., those that perform some 
cybersecurity due diligence) do not do enough (as evidenced by 
the level of breaches/incidents). TPRM organizations must begin 
focusing more on the Information Security domain, and either 
directly bring cybersecurity experts into their organizations or 
partner with cybersecurity teams to address the gap. Doing so 
will also require that a cybersecurity team is able to understand 
the problem with third parties and address the risk.
While the fines and publicity for failure to follow TPRM 
guidelines are not as big, instances of regulators acting can be  
found:
• In 2020, the OCC assessed an $85 million civil money pen-
alty against USAA for failure to implement and maintain an 
effective risk management compliance.
• In 2020, the OCC assessed a $60 million civil money penalty 
against Morgan Stanley for not properly decommissioning 
some Wealth Management business data centers.
• In 2020, the OCC assessed a $400 million civil money penalty 
against Citibank for failures in enterprise risk management.
• In 2020, the Federal Reserve announced an enforcement 
action against Citigroup Inc., requiring that the firm cor -
rect several longstanding deficiencies.
• In 2020, the OCC assessed an $80  million civil money 
penalty against Capital One for not establishing an effec-
tive risk assessment process, which led to the breach in its 
public cloud.
• In 2013, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
lowered the burden of proof for proxy disclosure enhance-
ments on risk management inadequacy from fraud to simply 
negligence. This means that boards of directors and senior
