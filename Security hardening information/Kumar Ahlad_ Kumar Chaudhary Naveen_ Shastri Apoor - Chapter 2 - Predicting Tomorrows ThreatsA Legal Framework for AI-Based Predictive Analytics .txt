2.1 Introduction
In the dynamic and evolving landscape of cybersecurity, we find ourselves entwined in a tale reminiscent of Zeno’s paradox1—a perpetual race between the swift rabbit of technology and the tortoise of the legal framework. In this digital world, the rabbit charges ahead, symbolizing the rapid evolution of technology, unveiling new threats at a breakneck pace, while the tortoise, our legal system, moves at a slow pace to establish order and protection in the expansive digital realm. In this intricate dance between innovation and regulation, this transcends the philosophical allegory of Zeno’s paradox. It delves into the pressing question: How can we not only predict but also effectively mitigate tomorrow’s cybersecurity threats?
In this constant chase, the law has often tried to model the existing notions whenever the significant modifications induced by computer osmosis in legal relations have generated distortions that are no longer tolerable for the legal system itself.2 As a result, enhanced protection at the European level is now required to control how personal data is processed. Similarly, we contend that the creation of a legal framework that ensures adherence to procedural rules and individuals’ fundamental rights is required for the use of technology in investigative processes.
This chapter embarks on an exploration into the balance required to predict and counteract tomorrow’s cybersecurity threats. Much like the dynamic dance of Zeno’s paradox, our narrative unfolds in a parallel universe—one where technology and law are intricately connected, engaged in a perpetual race within the cybersecurity domain. The digital watchtower metaphor comes to life, portraying AI algorithms as vigilant sentinels detecting anomalies and unveiling potential breaches before they materialize. The exploration extends beyond philosophical contemplation to practical applications, unraveling instances where AI, armed with complicated algorithms, successfully thwarts common threats like phishing, malware, misinformation, and the rise of deepfakes. As we illuminate the intricacies of AI’s role in cybersecurity, the spotlight reveals the symbiotic relationship between technology and the timeless principles of cybersecurity.
Moreover, the impact of the fourth industrial revolution on data-dependent and spatially data-centric systems has been profound in the past decade, driven by significant scientific and technological advancements. The space industry has witnessed the emergence of new hostile capabilities targeting space systems due to these advancements. Countermeasures, such as the utilization of Emerging Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) like artificial intelligence (AI), have been instrumental in combating malicious activities. AI, evolving over the years, has broadened its role within cybersecurity, with one pivotal evolution being predictive analytics.3
Predictive analytics, a crucial aspect of AI’s evolution, empowers cybersecurity with a proactive edge, foreseeing potential dangers based on historical data and emerging trends. As AI’s role expands, the need for a concurrent evolution in legal and ethical frameworks becomes imperative. Governments and international organizations grapple with the challenge of effectively regulating AI within the cybersecurity domain, aiming to strike a balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding against malicious uses of this technology.
Ethical considerations surrounding cybersecurity and AI necessitate a comprehensive exploration of strategies that harness AI’s benefits while mitigating its drawbacks. Real-time automated response mechanisms have become indispensable in the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape. AI, as a potent weapon, plays a pivotal role in anticipating and neutralizing cyberattacks, enabling a swift and flexible response without human intervention—known as “real-time automated response.”
Venturing deeper into AI-driven threat prediction, it is crucial to comprehend the multifaceted nature of prospective dangers posed by cyber adversaries, ranging from lone malevolent hackers to organized cybercrime syndicates and nation-states engaged in cyber espionage. The paradigm shift introduced by AI in cybersecurity underscores the ethical and legal ramifications associated with its use, necessitating robust legal frameworks to address issues of accountability, transparency, and potential biases in AI systems. This research aims to contribute a tentative legal perspective to address these emerging challenges.
The detection of cyberattacks as well as their sophistication and simplicity of execution could be enhanced by the application of AI. Of the many subfields of AI, GenAI—a type of AI that permits the creation of new information based on input training content—is especially pertinent to the cybersecurity conversation.4 GenAI can be used to produce very convincing social engineering or phishing emails that are customized for each target, boosting the attack’s chance of success. Acronis, a world leader in cyber defense, released a “Cyberthreats Report” that shows concerning patterns in cyberattacks during the first half of
