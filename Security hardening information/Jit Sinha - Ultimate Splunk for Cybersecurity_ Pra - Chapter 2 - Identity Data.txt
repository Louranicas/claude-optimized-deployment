Identity Data:

Scenario: With more workers working remotely, JIT Inc. must control and protect employee identity.
How It Helps: The Identity Data dashboard provides in-depth information on each employee’s identity profile. Information on user roles, access rights, and behavior patterns is included in this. Using this dashboard, JIT Inc. can look for unusual user behavior, possible account breaches, or privilege escalations that might point to security risks.
