Data Encryption Standard
The DES is a symmetric key block cipher published by the NIST. DES, like many other major symmetric ciphers, is built upon the Feistel block cipher structure, pioneered by IBM cryptographer Horst Feistel in the early 1970s. This design involves multiple rounds, each comprising bit-shuffling, non-linear substitutions (using S-boxes), and exclusive OR operations. The majority of modern symmetric encryption systems utilize this structure, commonly referred to as a Feistel network.
In DES, as with most encryption algorithms, two inputs are expected: The plain text to be encrypted and the secret key. The specific arrangement of the plain text and the key used for encryption and decryption determine the cipher's characteristics. DES operates as a symmetric 64-bit block cipher, employing the same key for encryption, decryption and processing data in 64-bit blocks. Despite utilizing a 64-bit (or 8-byte) key input, DES employs a 56-bit key size, with the least significant bit of each byte typically used for parity (often set to odd for DES) or arbitrarily set without enhancing security. Block numbering proceeds from left to right, making the 8th bit of each byte the parity bit. Upon receiving a plain text message for encryption, it is organized into 64-bit blocks for processing. The last block is padded if the message's bit count is not a multiple of
