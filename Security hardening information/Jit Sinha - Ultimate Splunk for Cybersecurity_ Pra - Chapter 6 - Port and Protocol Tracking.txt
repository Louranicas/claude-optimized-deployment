Identity Domain
In order to make sure that persons and devices accessing resources within an organization are correctly verified and allowed, the identity security domain focuses on analyzing identity and asset lookup data. Systems for managing user IDs, authenticating users, and enforcing access control regulations are known as identity and access management (IAM) systems. Implementing robust authentication systems, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), managing user provisioning and deprovisioning, and employing role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions are all considered best practices in this area. Organizations can identify insider threats, unlawful access, and identity theft by monitoring identity-related data.
In cybersecurity, the identity domain is concerned with controlling and securing user identities, access privileges, and network activity. To ensure secure access to sensitive data and resources, certain threats and risks within this area can be monitored and managed. The Identity domain is frequently related to the following dangers:

Brute force attacks: These are attempts to obtain unauthorized access to a system by repeatedly attempting different users and password combinations. Attackers employ automated technologies to swiftly test a huge number of options. Organizations should develop account lockout procedures, enforce strong password regulations, and employ multi-factor authentication to defend against brute force assaults.
Misuse of privileged accounts: Privileged accounts have enhanced access rights and permissions within a system, such as root or administrator accounts. The infrastructure and data of an organization may suffer serious harm if these accounts are misused. Organizations should follow the concept of least privilege, keep an eye on privileged account activity, and employ privileged access control tools to reduce the risk of privileged account exploitation.
Access by uncommon or new accounts: If uncommon or new accounts are not adequately monitored and managed, they may present a risk. Unusual behavior from these accounts may be a sign of intrusion or malicious intent. To guarantee compliance with security regulations and identify potential dangers, organizations should monitor and assess the activities of new accounts, especially those with enhanced rights.
Access by expired or disabled accounts: Access to any system resources should not be permitted by expired or disabled accounts. However, if these accounts are not handled appropriately, attackers may use them to gain illegal access. Organizations should periodically check dormant accounts, disable them, and keep an eye out for any attempts to log into these accounts.
Unusual application access: Attackers may utilize SSH or VNC, among other programs, to enter networks without authorization or carry out destructive deeds. It can be useful to keep an eye out for atypical program usage to spot insider threats or possible security lapses. To spot any suspect or unauthorized activities, organizations should set application control policies and keep an eye on application usage.

By addressing these threats within the Identity domain, organizations can better protect their network, data, and resources, ensuring a secure environment for their users and operations.
Identity Domain Areas
This section will cover key dashboards such as Asset Data, Identity Data, and User Session. These dashboards focus on monitoring and analyzing asset and identity information along with user session activities, offering essential insights to identify potential security issues and improve overall identity management.
Asset Data
The Enterprise Security Asset Center dashboard is a tool for perusing and looking up things in the asset data. Along with other details on each asset, it offers a thorough view of the hosts, IP addresses, and subnets used by the firm. This dashboard provides information, such as asset location and priority level, to help link asset properties with indexed events.




Figure 8.17: Asset Center Dashboard
Dashboard filters enable users to refine the results shown on the dashboard panels:

Asset: A known or unknown asset
Priority: Filter by the Priority field in the Asset table
Business Unit: A group or department classification for the asset
Category: Filter by the Category field in the Asset table
Owner: Filter by the Owner field in the Asset table
Time Range: Select the time range to represent

The dashboard panels provide insights into various aspects of the assets, including:

Assets by Priority: Displays the number of assets by priority level, with a drilldown that opens a search with the selected priority level.
Assets by Business Unit: Displays the relative amount of assets by business unit, with a drilldown that opens a search with the selected business unit.
Assets by Category: Displays the relative amount of assets by category, with a drilldown that opens a search with the selected category.
Asset Information: Shows all assets matching the current dashboard filters. The drilldown opens the Asset Investigator dashboard if the ip, nt_host, mac, or dns fields are selected; otherwise, it opens a search with the selected field.

Identity Data
Users of Enterprise Security can browse and look for things within the identity data using the Identity Center dashboard. Identity information for each identity comprises account names, legal names, nicknames, alternate names, and other related details. This information is used to link user information to indexed events, adding further context.



Figure 8.18: Identity Center Dashboard
To filter identities in the Identity Center dashboard, a key=value pair search field is used. Users can enter key=value pairs instead of plain text strings, such as email=*acmetech.com or nick=a_nickname.
Dashboard filters help refine the results displayed on the dashboard panels, as follows:

Username: A known or unknown user
Priority: Filter by the Priority field in the Identities table
Business Unit: A group or department classification for the identity
Category: Filter by the Category field in the Identities table
Watchlisted Identities Only: Filter by the identities tagged as “watchlist” in the Identities table
Time Range: Select the time range to represent

The dashboard panels offer insights into various aspects of the identities, as follows:

Identities by Priority: Displays the count of identities by priority level, with a drilldown that opens a search with the selected priority level.
Identities by Business Unit: Displays the relative number of identities by business unit, with a drilldown that opens a search with the selected business unit.
Identities by Category: Displays the relative number of identities by category, with a drilldown that opens a search with the selected category.
Identity Information: Shows all assets matching the current dashboard filters. The drilldown opens the Identity Investigator dashboard if the identity field is selected; otherwise, it opens a search with the selected field.

User Session
Enterprise Security’s Session Center dashboard offers a summary of network sessions that are used to link user-provided session data from DHCP or VPN servers to network activities. Users can access the dashboard to examine session records and locate the device or person that used an IP address during a session. Users and device association data from Splunk UBA or the Network Sessions data model can be used to review network session information.
