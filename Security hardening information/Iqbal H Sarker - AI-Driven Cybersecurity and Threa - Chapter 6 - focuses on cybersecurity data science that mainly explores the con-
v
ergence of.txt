Book: Iqbal H. Sarker - AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence_ Cyber Automation, Intelligent Decision-Making and Explainability (2024, Springer) - libgen.li
Chapter: 6 - focuses on cybersecurity data science that mainly explores the con-
v
ergence of cybersecurity and data science exploring its transformative potential in 
fortifying digital defenses. Throughout the chapter, advanced analytics, knowledge, 
and rule discovery as well as corresponding data-driven framework are highlighted within the broader area of cybersecurity data science. An emphasis is given to the 
pivotal role of explainable modeling in comprehending and mitigating sophisticated 
cyber threats as the threat landscape evolves. Thus the role of knowledge and rule discovery is explored brieﬂy advocating for a paradigm shift toward explainable 
modeling to address the evolving nature of today’s diverse cyber threats. Data-driven 
insights and knowledge discovery are explored through methodologies, tools, and best practices, providing a roadmap for practitioners and researchers. Overall, this
