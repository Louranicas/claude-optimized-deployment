The flowchart starts with "Intent," which leads to "Translation," followed by "Activation." From there, it progresses to "Validation," then to "Implementation," and next to "Assurance." The final stage, "Feedback and Optimization," loops back to "Intent," completing the cycle. Each stage is represented by a circular or semi-circular shape with text inside. The process highlights its iterative nature, with feedback and optimization influencing the initial intent, demonstrating a continuous improvement cycle. The arrows between stages emphasize the flow and connection of each step in the process.

Long Description for Figure 4.1
The flowchart starts with "Intent," which leads to "Translation," followed by "Activation." From there, it progresses to "Validation," then to "Implementation," and next to "Assurance." The final stage, "Feedback and Optimization," loops back to "Intent," completing the cycle. Each stage is represented by a circular or semi-circular shape with text inside. The process highlights its iterative nature, with feedback and optimization influencing the initial intent, demonstrating a continuous improvement cycle. The arrows between stages emphasize the flow and connection of each step in the process.

FIGURE 4.1 Stages of intent-based networking.

Intent definition involves defining high-level goals and policies for the network, while translation converts this into actionable policies. Activation ensures consistent deployment across the network infrastructure, while Validation involves continuous monitoring, compliance checks, and security assessments. Assurance and Optimization use ML and AI to maintain the networkâ€™s desired state and provide improvement recommendations.
ML algorithms are very much capable of detecting activities such as intrusions, which is illustrated in Figure 4.
