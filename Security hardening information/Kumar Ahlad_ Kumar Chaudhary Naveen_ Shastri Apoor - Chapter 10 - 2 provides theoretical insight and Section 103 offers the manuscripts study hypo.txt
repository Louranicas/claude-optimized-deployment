10.2 Literature Review Literature Review and Theoretical Basis

10.2.1 Theoretical Lenses Adoption
Institutional theory. According to institutional theory, a firm’s structures, policies, and practices are shaped through institutional changes. In order to strengthen their positions and legitimacy, organizations must abide by the laws and customs of the institutional environment (Bruton et al., 2010). This theory is used by researchers to examine how institutions, whether inside to an organization or external, affect the design, application, and results of technologies. Because of this, the operations of any corporation also reflect the expectations of its institutional stakeholders as well as the laws and customs of the institutional setting. Institutional pressures are thus created by these expectations, laws, and conventions, compelling businesses to adopt cutting-edge procedures (Jiang et al., 2023). Despite the fact that institutional theory has frequently been studied in the context of bigger organizations (Bruton et al., 2010), institutional theory has emerged as a key theory to explain events in small and entrepreneurial enterprises (Yousafzai et al., 2015).
Resource-based view theory. According to the resource-based view theory, key resources determine how well a company performs (Chatterjee et al., 2021). Within a company, resources can be both material and immaterial assets (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). This thesis states that precious, uncommon, unique, and irreplaceable resources can develop a competitive advantage by adding value and enhancing business performance. Such a benefit can last for a very long time. Resource-based view theory is commonly used to show how firm capabilities, resources, and performance are related (Chen & Lin, 2021). The resource-based view theory has been employed extensively in earlier studies in the larger information system domain. More specifically, Melville et al. (2004) acknowledge the potential of resource-based view theory to enable empirically testable hypotheses that increase our understanding of the function of information system resources in organizational success. The AIC is becoming an increasingly important and intangible resource for improving corporate performance (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). According to Chaudhuri et al. (2024), all organizations may benefit from using AI to get a competitive edge. Indeed, businesses may gain access to priceless, uncommon, unique, and irreplaceable resources through AIC (Ghasemaghaei, 2021). The resource-based view theory offers a suitable theoretical foundation since gaining a competitive edge requires an understanding of the specific AI resources that a corporation must manage.


10.2.2 Conceptual Respects
Cyber forensic accounting. According to Rezaee et al. (2016), forensic accounting is the application of science and technology to unearth dishonest accounting, financial, and company practices. This aids in the detection and prevention of financial fraud as well as the reduction of corruption and the prosecution of financial crimes. More specifically, the main responsibility of forensic accountants is to investigate illegal activities such as fraud, white-collar crime, corruption, money laundering, computer fraud, conversion, and theft. Forensic accounting guarantees that financial statements give reliable information to diverse stakeholders so they can protect their interests and make important business decisions. Remarkably, it can be difficult to collect pertinent data and spot trends from the huge amounts of data used in cybercrimes. Hacking, identity theft, cyberstalking, and phishing are only a few of the varied types of cybercrimes that can occur (Hossain, 2023). To locate the sources of cyberattacks and recover stolen funds, it involves a variety of approaches including data analytics, digital forensics, and financial investigations. In this regard, cyber forensic accounting is the application of forensic accounting principles to the investigation and prevention of cybercrimes (Hossain, 2023).
Artificial Intelligence and artificial intelligence capabilities. AI is described as technology that displays elements of human intelligence (Huang & Rust, 2018). As technology advances, it now tries to automatically recognize the complex patterns concealed behind data and make wise decisions based on detected data patterns. AI refers to the use of technology tools to attain goals autonomously while taking into account any potential limits while Mariani et al. (2022) argued that AI is defined as computational entities that operate intelligently in order to perceive, learn, memorize, reason, and solve problems in order to engage in goal-directed action. According to Mikalef and Gupta (2021), the AIC of firms is defined as the capacity of firms to develop, integrate, and use resources based on AI. AIC is the capacity of an innovation team to use AI machines to mimic human cognitive capabilities and carry out activities intelligently, such as learning and problem-solving.
Legal and ethical consideration. Many nations and localities have adopted ethical guidelines after realizing the risks that AI poses to morality. In a declaration published in March 2018, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies outlined seven fundamental principles. These include upholding human dignity by forbidding the use of discriminatory AI algorithms, guaranteeing human autonomy and transparency in decision-making processes involving AI systems, accepting responsibility for preventing harm caused by AI, promoting justice and fairness by addressing biases and creating mechanisms for equitable distribution, enforcing the rule of law and accountability for damages caused by AI, placing a priority on security and safety in human-machine interactions, and more. The “Artificial Intelligence Governance Principles in the New Generation: Developing Responsible Artificial Intelligence” was published by the Chinese Artificial Intelligence Governance Committee in
