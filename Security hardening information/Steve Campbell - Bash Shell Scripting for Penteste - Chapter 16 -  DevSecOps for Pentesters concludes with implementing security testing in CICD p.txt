In this part, you will establish a solid foundation in Bash scripting specifically tailored for pentesting. 
Beginning with setting up a proper hacking environment and configuring the Bash shell, this section 
progresses through essential file and directory management techniques needed for security assessments. 
Y ou will master core programming concepts, including variables, conditionals, loops, and arrays, 
before diving into pattern matching with regular expressions – a crucial skill for parsing security
