Chapter: 2 - Focus groups, research, coordination 
The creation of working, reflection, research and coordination groups, in 
charge of organizing training initiatives and dialogue with the united 
industrial world, is neither an appr oach specific to the CIA, nor to 
intelligence in general, no r to the theme “AI”. In the same year, 1983, the 
DIA and the NSA, for example36, also created working groups dedicated to 
AI. The function of each of these groups was to think about AI for the 
specific context of each agency (D ARPA approaches AI for defense 
purposes, the CIA for intellig ence, etc.). The AISG (Artificial Intelligence 
Steering Group), within the CIA, observed, in 1984, that defense invests 
much more in AI research than the in telligence community does, and that a 
rapprochement should be envisaged in order to capitalize on the advances 
made by defense37.  
As soon as it was implemented, the IS GF organized meetings which took 
the form of visits to institutions where AI work was being carried out: the 
National Bureau of Standards (NBS)38 was visited on August 27, 1984, and 
the MITRE Corporation on May 10, 198439. Through these meetings, the 
members of the ISAG tried to identify projects with potential applications in 
the field of intelligence.  
Within the CIA ISB (Information Syst ems Board), several work streams 
were created, including one dedicated to AI (Artificial Intelligence 
Applications Working Group – AIAWG). During its 1983 meetings, one of 
the objectives was to identify the CIA’s AI needs or the opportunities that AI 
could offer the agency. The method for identifying these needs was to ask 
each department within the agency wh at AI applications they would find 
useful. This approach assumes that the interlocutors have a fairly precise 
knowledge of the possibilities of AI: “it was interesting to see common
