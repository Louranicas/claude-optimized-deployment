Contingency Planning
In terms of contingency planning, NIST Special Publication 800–34, Rev. 1, provides instructions for federal information system contingency planning. Contingency planning involves interim measures to recover services after a disruption, such as relocating systems, using alternative equipment, or manual methods. This offers specific recommendations for three platform types: are client/server systems, telecommunications systems, and mainframe systems.
There is a clear process for developing and maintaining a contingency planning programme, integrated into the system development life cycle. Develop the contingency planning policy statement. A formal policy provides the authority and guidance necessary for an effective plan. Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA identifies and prioritises critical systems and components. Identify preventive controls. Measures to reduce system disruptions can increase availability and reduce costs. Create contingency strategies. Recovery strategies ensure quick and effective system recovery. Develop an information system contingency plan. The plan should include detailed guidance for restoring a damaged system based on its security impact level. Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises. Testing validates recovery capabilities, training prepares personnel, and exercises identify gaps, improving plan effectiveness. Ensure plan maintenance. The plan should be updated regularly to stay current with system and organisational changes.
There are three sample formats for contingency plans based on low-, moderate-, or high-impact levels, as defined by FIPS Publication 199 (FIPS 199). This defines three levels of potential impact on organisations or individuals should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Each format includes three phases: Activation/Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution. The Activation/Notification phase involves activating the plan and notifying personnel. The Recovery phase outlines actions for restoring operations at an alternative site. The Reconstitution phase includes testing system functionality and preparing for future outages.
Information systems are vital to mission/business processes. It is critical that these systems operate effectively without excessive interruption.
Salami et al. (2024) argue contingency planning supports the need for quick recovery after a service disruption by establishing plans, procedures, and technical measures. Each system’s plan is unique, addressing its specific confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.1
Information system contingency planning involves strategies to recover systems, operations, and data. It includes restoring systems with alternative equipment. Use manual processes for short-term disruptions. Recover operations at an alternative location for long-term disruptions. Implement controls based on the system’s security impact level.
This guides those responsible for preparing and maintaining information system contingency plans (ISCPs). It discusses essential elements, processes, and considerations for various system platforms, providing examples to help develop ISCPs.
Purpose
This helps organisations understand ISCP development through practical guidelines. While it establishes a baseline, each organisation may have specific needs. The document explains the relationship between contingency planning, security, emergency management, organisational resiliency, and the system development life cycle (SDLC). It helps personnel evaluate systems to determine planning requirements and priorities. Requirements from FIPS 199 and NIST Special Publication 800–53 are integrated throughout. Considerations for impact levels and associated security controls are presented to assist in developing appropriate strategies. Although largely independent of specific hardware, operating systems, and applications, technical considerations for common platforms are addressed.

Scope
Guidelines for federal organisations are set out. This process discusses technologies supporting contingency capabilities, recognising the rapid development and obsolescence of products. The document describes practices to enhance contingency planning for client/server systems, telecommunications systems, and mainframe systems.
It outlines principles for various incidents affecting information system operations.
These range from minor incidents causing short-term disruptions to disasters affecting operations for extended periods. Since information systems vary, specific incident types and measures are not detailed here. Instead, a process is provided to identify planning needs for effective contingency plans.
This does not cover facility-level information system planning (disaster recovery plans) or organisational mission continuity (COOP plans) except where needed to restore systems. It also does not address continuity of mission/business processes, which depend on other resources. Recovery of mission-essential functions is covered by COOP or business continuity plans, described in
