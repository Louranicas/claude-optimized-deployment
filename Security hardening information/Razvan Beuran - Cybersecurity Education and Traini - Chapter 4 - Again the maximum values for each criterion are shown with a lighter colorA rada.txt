Chapter: 4 - Again, the maximum values for each criterion are shown with a lighter color.A radar chart comparing two datasets, "Maximum" and "CyTOFONE," across 13 metrics labeled EM-1 to EM-13. The "Maximum" dataset is represented by a dark gray line, while "CyTOFONE" is shown with a light gray shaded area. The chart highlights differences in performance across the metrics, with notable variations at EM-2, EM-5, and EM-10.Fig. 13.4Network environment management capability assessment of CyTrONE
With regard to the criteria related to functionality, EM-1 through EM-5, we remark an overall satisfactory level. Noteworthy are criteria EM-1 and EM-4, for which maximum scores were assigned, as they are related to the support of environment creation for parallel training activities, and for network attack execution, which are important functions of a training platform. One aspect that is not at all supported in CyTrONE, however, is background traffic generation, as illustrated by the Level 0 score for criterion EM-5.Criteria EM-6 through EM-8 refer to performance characteristics, and CyTrONE scored maximum capability levels for all of them. The same can be said for criteria EM-9 through EM-13, which are related to usability. This brings the general capability of the CyTrONE framework to a relatively high level from a network environment management perspective.
