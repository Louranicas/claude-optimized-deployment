Chapter: 1 - Wireless security is crucial across various types of wireless networks due to inherent vulnerabilities posed by their reliance on radio waves for communication. In WLANs commonly used within office spaces or homes, securing the network is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. WLANs can be susceptible to attacks like eavesdropping or unauthorized network access without proper security measures. Similarly, in WMANs that cover larger geographical areas like cities, robust security protocols are necessary to safeguard against potential threats like interception of data transmissions or unauthorized network intrusion. WPANs, typically used for personal devices like Bluetooth-enabled gadgets, require security measures to protect against unauthorized device pairing or data theft. Lastly, WWANs, which extend over large distances and often rely on cellular networks, need stringent security to safeguard against cyber threats targeting mobile devices and sensitive data transmitted over the network:

Wireless networks offer convenience and ease to users, although their operational mechanisms can be complicated and multilayered. Several protocols and technologies are employed to deliver a dependable connection to users. Wireless security measures are designed to prevent unauthorized access or harm to computers connected to wireless networks. Security effectiveness depends heavily on users utilizing available options to their fullest extent such as:

The built-in encryption features provided by wireless networks, like Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
Virtual private networks (VPNs)

Wireless networks are often more susceptible to attacks than traditional wired networks, as anyone can access them and may allow for interception of connections. To ensure the security of a wireless connection, the following features should be kept in mind:

Authentication: Identifying the endpoints of the wireless network and the end-users.
Privacy: Safeguarding wireless data packets from interception by unauthorized parties.
Integrity: Wireless data packets remain unchanged and reliable during transmission.

Failure to secure a wireless network can expose it to various attacks by malicious actors. For instance, an attacker could intercept data transmitted or received over the network, potentially compromising sensitive information such as passwords or personal data. Additionally, inadequate security measures could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to files and folders stored on connected systems, leading to potential data breaches or privacy violations. Another risk is exploiting your internet connection by hijacking it to use your bandwidth for unauthorized purposes, such as launching denial of service (DoS) attacks or engaging in illegal activities. These threats underscore the importance of robust security measures to protect wireless networks and their data. Measures like encryption, strong authentication protocols, and regular security updates are crucial to mitigate these risks and safeguard network integrity and user privacy.
The following steps should be taken to secure a wireless network:

The default home network name should be changed to ensure security. This is also known as Service Set Identifier (SSID). The default network name reveals the router brand being used and helps cyber criminals search for vulnerabilities in specific brands and try to exploit them. The SSID should be unique and should not reveal the brand manufacturer name.
A strong Wi-Fi password should be set to access the wireless connection. Many times, the password set is too simple to predict and guess. Mobile numbers, childrenâ€™s names, or dates of birth can prove disastrous since anyone can access the network. The password should be long enough and a combination of alphabets, numbers, and special characters to make it difficult for an attacker to guess. Also, the Wi-Fi password should be changed after a certain period, like every 30 days.
Wireless encryption should be enabled. Routers provide encryption options like Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WPA, WPA2, and WPA
