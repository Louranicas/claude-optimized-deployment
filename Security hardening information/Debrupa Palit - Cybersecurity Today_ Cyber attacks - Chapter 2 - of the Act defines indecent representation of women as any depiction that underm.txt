of the Act defines indecent representation of women as any depiction that undermines public morality.

The primary objective of the Act is to prohibit the depiction of women in a manner that is indecent, derogatory, or likely to promote exploitation or discrimination against women. It seeks to prevent the dissemination of material that portrays women as mere objects of desire or reinforces stereotypes that undermine their dignity and equality. Additionally, the Act establishes a mechanism for the enforcement of its provisions, with designated authorities responsible for monitoring and regulating the portrayal of women in media. It also provides for the establishment of special courts to adjudicate cases related to violations of the Act, ensuring swift justice for victims of indecent representation.
Evidences in cyberspace, monitoring, surveillance
Digital evidence, any useful information collected from electronic devices, can be used in legal proceedings to reveal the truth about a crime. It can be extracted from computers used for criminal activities, including hard drives, media drives like USBs, and mobile devices. While data stored on disks and media devices is commonly examined, running computers also contain valuable information in their main memory or Random Access Memory (RAM). This volatile memory stores data only while the system is powered on, making it a potential source of evidence that might not be found on disks. The information in RAM can include usernames, passwords, encryption keys, unencrypted data, unsaved documents, and other critical evidence.
Sources of digital evidence are:

Internet: Information from websites, emails, message boards, chat rooms, file sharing networks, and intercepted communications.
Computers: Data extracted using special methods, including time stamps, IP addresses, VPN information, and MAC addresses.
Portable devices: Information from cell phones, tablets, and other handheld devices.
Smartphones/Tablets: Data stored on these devices.
Laptops: Information stored on laptop computers.
CCTV and surveillance systems: Recordings from security cameras.
GPS devices: Location data recorded by GPS devices.
Media devices: Data stored on pen drives, CDs, DVDs, or external hard disks.

Cybersecurity monitoring is an automated process that continuously observes network traffic, endpoint behavior, servers, logs, and other digital assets to identify potential cyber threats. When suspicious activity is detected, monitoring tools alert the IT team, allowing for a swift response to mitigate the threat before it can cause significant damage. Cybersecurity monitoring utilizes real-time responses to help organizations detect threats more quickly and efficiently. These threats often stem from active cyberattacks or system vulnerabilities. To address this, cybersecurity monitoring focuses on two primary types of monitoring: endpoint monitoring and network monitoring.
Cybersecurity monitoring services offer several advantages for organizations:

Enhanced threat prevention: Continuous monitoring strengthens network security, reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. If a breach occurs, it can be mitigated quickly, limiting damage.
Improved employee productivity: Monitoring tools help track employee activity, enabling organizations to optimize workforce efficiency. By identifying network vulnerabilities, monitoring also ensures smoother system operations, boosting productivity.
Regulatory compliance: Cybersecurity monitoring helps maintain data integrity and prevent breaches, ensuring compliance with industry regulations. This protects brand image and customer trust.
Reduced downtime: Regular monitoring helps identify and address security threats proactively, minimizing downtime caused by cyberattacks. This prevents financial and reputational losses.
Advanced threat intelligence: Consistent monitoring generates valuable threat intelligence, enabling faster identification of malware and anomalies. This helps strengthen future network security and build a continuously evolving threat intelligence database.

Cybersecurity surveillance involves the continuous monitoring of network traffic, computer systems, and digital devices to identify and prevent security breaches. This includes activities like tracking user behavior, analyzing system logs, and detecting intrusions or malware. Surveillance is essential for cybersecurity as it enables organizations to proactively identify and mitigate threats before they cause harm. By monitoring networks and systems, organizations can detect and respond to cyberattacks in real-time, safeguarding sensitive data from compromise or theft. Various tools and technologies, such as network monitoring software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) platforms, and antivirus software, are used for cybersecurity surveillance. These tools help organizations identify suspicious activity, analyze security events, and alert security teams to potential threats.
