Port Frequencies
The /etc/services file offers a simple port-to-service-name mapping, but we can improve it. Nmap has a file called nmap-services (usually located at /usr/share/ nmap/nmap-services) that looks almost identical to /etc/services but has one advantage: it includes the port open frequency, a numerical value that describes how often a port is seen open, such as 0.
