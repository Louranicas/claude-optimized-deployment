     Preface
    



     Bash shell scripting is a fundamental skill in the pentester’s toolkit, enabling the automation of complex security assessments, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation tasks.
    

     This book provides a comprehensive guide to mastering Bash scripting specifically for pentesting, covering everything from basic scripting concepts to advanced techniques for evading detection and integrating with modern technologies such as artificial
    


      intelligence (AI).
     




     The book is structured in three parts, taking readers from foundational concepts through practical pentesting applications to advanced topics.
    

     You’ll learn how to leverage Bash for reconnaissance, web application testing, network infrastructure assessment, privilege escalation, and maintaining persistence.
    

     The book emphasizes hands-on learning with practical examples and real-world scenarios that pentesters encounter in their
    


      daily work.
     






     Who this book is for
    



     This book is designed for several
    


      key audiences:
     





      Security professionals and pentesters looking to automate their workflows using Bash
     



      System administrators wanting to enhance their security testing capabilities
     



      Security researchers interested in developing custom tools and scripts
     



      DevSecOps practitioners aiming to integrate security testing into their pipelines
     



      Students and aspiring pentesters seeking to build a strong foundation in automation
     




     Basic familiarity with Linux/Unix systems and command-line interfaces is helpful but not required, as the book builds from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.
    

     You must have the knowledge and computer resources to create virtual machines and install the Kali Linux
    


      operating system.
