Chapter: 1547 - These rules are intended to ensure decorum, give all members the right to be heard and guarantee majority rule. They also provide historic continuity and confidence that laws and regulations passed by all legislative assemblies followed a known and respected process. Most American lawmaking bodies followed Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which he had based on the British rules.
But those rules are extremely complicated, at times contradictory and always subject to interpretation. They can be molded by the presiding official to assure a desired outcome. Pinchback looked at Senator McMillen. It was possible he smiled. “The roll is being called,” he responded. “No motion can be entertained.”
McMillen was furious. “I desire to enter my protest to this arbitrary ruling.”
Pinchback ignored him as the secretary continued calling the roll. Other Democratic senators began objecting, standing, demanding to be heard.
When the secretary was done the entire body of the newly elected senators replacing the former members were sworn into office. Several Democrats refused to be sworn in or left the room, hoping to deny Pinchback the quorum required to conduct business. But there were not enough of them to stop the proceedings. By adding men supposedly elected by both Returning Boards, a legally sufficient number of senators were seated—even if there was no electoral basis for seating them.
Warmoth had been defeated.
Or so it seemed to everyone other than Warmoth.
After the chaplain had read the opening prayer Warmoth’s men tried one last time, shouting that the proceedings were a sham. What was going on was not legal! It couldn’t be allowed. The Senate had been organized contrary to law. It wouldn’t stand! They demanded to be heard.
It was probable there had been some technical violations of the rules of order. But rather than recognizing the protestors, Pinchback stood and began speaking, stunning senators and spectators into silence with his shocking claims. The night before, he began, Governor Warmoth had launched a conspiracy to overthrow the laws of the Senate. His voice rising in anger, Pinchback continued. At midnight the previous evening Governor Warmoth and his friend Mr. C. E. Weed, the owner of the New Orleans Evening Times, had come to his door, where they “aroused me from my slumber, and made a proposition to me. They offered me $50,000 and said that I could name, and the appointment would be made...of any officers if I would enter into the conspiracy.”
Pinchback continued, “I told them then and there that I would consider it.” And he did, he said. Early the next morning he received an urgent note from Warmoth asking to meet, whatever his decision, as soon as possible. He ignored that request, instead responding with a note. “I have slept on the proposition you made last night,” he wrote, “and have resolved to do my duty to my state, party and race, and I therefore respectfully decline your proposition.
“I am truly sorry for you, but I cannot help you.”
It was an astonishing moment: he was accusing the most powerful politician in the state of committing a serious crime. And, for at least some people, equally astonishing was his claim that he had rejected the offer. When the hubbub finally subsided, he addressed the Warmoth senators directly and told them he knew what they were trying to do and added, “Had your conspiracy succeeded the Constitution and the laws would have again been trampled underfoot.”
Senator McMillen was not at all satisfied. Once again, he began protesting that these decisions were arbitrary, they were unconstitutional. Pinchback had no right to make these rulings because he was not the legal and lawfully elected lieutenant governor. He had been a member of the State Senate when elected, and the Constitution specifically prohibits anyone holding two elective offices.
When Pinchback tried to gavel him quiet, McMillen simply raised his voice. I will not be silenced, he yelled, pounding his fist on his desk—until finally, he was silenced by the lieutenant governor.
The House of Representatives, also meeting in special session, voted overwhelmingly to impeach the governor for high crimes and misdemeanors in office and crimes committed against the Constitution and the laws of the state. The seven articles of impeachment included “unconstitutional and unlawful” commissions of judges and government officials, conspiring to restrict the right to vote and offering a $50,000 bribe and the dispensation of patronage to Pinchback.
The resolution was presented to the Senate by a House committee. The Senate took the appropriate parliamentary actions. By law, Warmoth was removed from office. According to the state constitution, that vacancy was filled by the lieutenant governor. Thirty-five-year-old Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback became the first Black governor in American history. And he would serve until newly elected Governor Kellogg was inaugurated in January.
In that evening’s Times Weed admitted to being at the meeting with Pinchback but denied hearing Warmoth make any such offer. Later Pinchback issued a minor clarification in front of the Senate. “I owe it to Mr. Weed to state that he was not present at the meeting, as in my heat I first suggested.” Mr. Weed had made the initial approach, he explained, asking him to meet with Warmoth at the St. Charles Hotel. Pinchback instead suggested a meeting in his parlor. The governor was nearby and arrived minutes later. “When the Governor came in,” Pinchback continued, “he was careful to have the folding doors closed, leaving Mr. Weed alone in one room... The Governor was too wily to have any witnesses, doubtless thinking that in a question of veracity he could outswear me.”
In the ensuing days Warmoth barely responded to the accusations. When he did finally speak, he objected to Pinchback being allowed to make claims without him having the opportunity to “disprove the statements.” And he could refute them, he claimed, at least partially because “I think we will show that Mr. Pinchback is not in the habit of resisting such temptations.”
Pinchback previously had been accused of wheeling and dealing. Stories had circulated that he had bought and sold public property while serving as parks commissioner. But nothing had ever been proved. That was not at all surprising.
Acting Governor Pinchback was himself an astute politician. Tall, bearded and handsomely fit, he was the child of racially mixed parents, his father being a Mississippi planter, his mother a slave he had freed. After leaving school to support his family he had served in the military and worked as a political organizer and aboard riverboats, where gamblers had befriended him and taught him their tricks. But more than anything else, he was smart, clever, personable and perhaps as ambitious and ethically adaptable as Henry Warmoth.
For some men, a moment like this might have proved too much: Pinchback embraced it. He had been preparing for the limelight his whole life. “It is said he is vain of his good looks and he certainly is possessed of very comely features,” wrote the Times-Picayune. “He is scrupulously neat in his dress, the only display indulged in being three large and very brilliant diamond studs and a massive gold watch chain.
“He was very fond of displaying his person on the avenues. If he could see a half dozen opera glasses leveled at him...he would be supremely happy...but he has a treacherous look about the eyes and is naturally very suspicious, but can easily be thrown off guard by a little flattery.”
A perfect match for Henry Warmoth.
Impeaching a man as popular as Warmoth and elevating Pinchback to the office just required sufficient votes from the legislature. But enforcing that ruling was far more difficult. That might require federal intervention. Senator Kellogg telegraphed the attorney general, warning that “a conflict may ensue.”
Grant hesitated.
While the Kellogg legislature was meeting at the Mechanics Institute, Warmoth assembled McEnery’s supporters at Lyceum Hall, a large theater that had been founded to host intellectual gatherings but after the end of the war had been given over to theater and performances. Inside the crowded hall, plans were laid to organize a political rebellion—to form a rival legislature consisting mostly of Democrats who claimed to have been legally elected.
Two governments were being formed.
The next day, thousands of McEnery Democrats rallied outside City Hall. McEnery spoke first, telling an already-boisterous crowd that there were no laws by which “we are prohibited from assembling and petitioning the...government for relief from the oppressions...imposed on us....
“We want law and order maintained and the candidates fairly elected put in their places.”
When he concluded his remarks Warmoth stepped forward and told the outraged people what they had come to hear. There was no question that McEnery had won the election! They were being cheated out of a great victory! He still had the returns in his possession, he told them: “How can they decide whether or not this or that officer is elected?”
Warmoth presented impressive figures to prove his point, although those figures were subject to interpretation. “The total number of votes polled was 128,402 of which number John McEnery had received 68,169 and William Pitt Kellogg 60,233...the Returns likewise showed the election to the House of Representatives of about seventy-five Fusion members and about thirty-five Republican members.” But “without even adopting or following any rational theory of computation [Republicans] added the enormous number of 12,657 to Senator Kellogg’s vote...and to further insult the intelligence of the public had deliberately struck off 14,140 from the votes cast for Senator McEnery!”
No one could doubt these numbers, he said. No one! They were “proved by the returns sworn to by the Commissioner of Elections and the Supervisors of Registration... These returns are in existence. They are unmutilated and unfalsified. They constitute the only evidence of the late election any law recognizes or that any honest judicial tribunal would accept!... The Judge of the United States Court became a confederate of the conspirators...”
The crowd roared in support of each claim. Cheating! Fraud! Lies! Their opponents would use any tactic to defeat him. Warmoth was the most honest man in the history of the great state and his rivals were afraid of him—and afraid of the people who were fighting for the truth.
The crowd loved him. They adored him. They would follow him wherever he led.
That same afternoon a so-called people’s government organized at Lyceum Hall. Reporting this, the New York Times warned, “Warmoth, in every way, is endeavoring to incite his followers to revolution and to overthrow the legitimate state government.” In his effort he had the assistance of Weed’s Times, which “by the incendiary appeals...is exciting the populace and violence is, by some, apprehended.”
The situation was becoming increasingly dangerous. About three hundred and fifty members of the state militia, reinforced by an additional hundred volunteers, took over the Carondelet Street armory, where they had ready access to weapons and ammunition. They would not recognize the Pinchback government, they announced, and would not obey his orders.
What could not be settled by ballots might now be settled by bullets. Warmoth’s militia locked all the entrances. They settled in, vowing not to leave until Governor Warmoth’s government was restored. And if Pinchback’s people tried to get them out...well, they would resist. Violently if necessary.
While negotiations to prevent a confrontation were ongoing, the real circus came to town. P. T. Barnum’s ten tents comprised “a museum, menagerie, caravan, hippodrome, polytechnic institute, zoological, cavalcade of chariots and circus for one admission fee.” If two legislatures competing for legitimacy and hundreds of soldiers holed up in an armory threatening an insurrection weren’t enough of a show, Barnum brought with him thousands of “novel and interesting attractions never before seen!” Among them, he boasted, were three Wild Fuji Cannibals ransomed from King Thokamban at a cost of $16,000, a snake charmer, a rhinoceros, a drove of camels and performing elephants and one hundred performing equestrians, acrobats and “Ladies in Mediaeval Costumes.” Those who purchased a copy of Barnum’s 960-page autobiography at the reduced price of $2.25 would receive free admission to the show!
As the standoff at the armory went into a second day Warmoth was trying to set up his own state government under the direction of McEnery. Tremendous pressure was put on senators and representatives to defect. Each man had to figure out which legislature to support. Careers were at stake. Several members finally crossed the street to join Warmoth, enough of them to allow the Lyceum assembly to claim it had a quorum. It elected a speaker and went to work.
Meanwhile, Democrats formed the Committee of One Hundred Citizens, among them the leading businessmen in New Orleans, to go to Washington to present their case to President Grant and Congress. They brought with them a petition signed by thousands of people supporting Warmoth and McEnery, stating, “This is the greatest outrage ever attempted to be carried out in our country... It is the universal belief that the case had been misrepresented and the facts greatly distorted.”
Not to be outdone, Kellogg and James Casey appealed to President Grant to “quiet matters” by recognizing “Governor Pinchback’s legislature.” Kellogg asked the president to send federal troops “for the protection of the legislature and the gubernatorial office.”
Warmoth and McEnery also sent telegrams, but theirs implored Grant to stay out of it. “I ask that no violent action be taken,” Warmoth wrote, “and no force be used by the government.” McEnery begged the president to make no decision until he had met with the delegation and they could “lay before you all the facts.”

While negotiations to prevent a confrontation were ongoing, the real circus came to town. P. T. Barnum’s ten tents comprised “a museum, menagerie, caravan, hippodrome, polytechnic institute, zoological, cavalcade of chariots and circus for one admission fee.” If two legislatures competing for legitimacy and hundreds of soldiers holed up in an armory threatening an insurrection weren’t enough of a show, Barnum brought with him thousands of “novel and interesting attractions never before seen!” Among them, he boasted, were three Wild Fuji Cannibals ransomed from King Thokamban at a cost of $16,000, a snake charmer, a rhinoceros, a drove of camels and performing elephants and one hundred performing equestrians, acrobats and “Ladies in Mediaeval Costumes.” Those who purchased a copy of Barnum’s 960-page autobiography at the reduced price of $2.25 would receive free admission to the show!

It seemed like there was a new development every minute. Extra editions of newspapers were “flying around the city like leaves in autumn.” Even Barnum’s doubled-humped Bactrian camel, reputed to be the only such animal in the country, couldn’t distract people from this confusing, dangerous situation.
Pinchback finally decided he would wait no longer. He ordered the Metropolitan Police department to take the armory. At about seven o’clock that night two hundred police officers, carrying Winchester rifles, “plentifully supplied with ball cartridges,” made a line across Carondelet Street to await the order to attack. Spectators rushed to the site to see the confrontation.
The chief of police was escorted into the building to meet with the militia commander. He was told that the garrison had orders from Governor Warmoth to hold the arsenal against “all authority except that of the United States.” And they intended to follow those orders.
Their allegiance to Warmoth defied description. It appeared they were willing to die, or kill, for him. The question was why? They knew he was corrupt; no one seriously doubted Pinchback’s story about the $50,000 bribe offer, they knew he had profited greatly during his time in office, and he was known to like a drink and dally with women. He was a carpetbagger, a Lincoln man. But none of that seemed to make much difference to them. They forgave him all of that. He understood them; he had touched a part of them that only a few others had reached. He was fighting for them, for the way of life they once had lived.
He was fighting against the powers who had beaten them. So they gave him their loyalty.
When he attacked Pinchback, claiming he had stolen the office, slurring and insulting him, they reacted. Pinchback’s life was threatened. An unsigned note warned, “If you do not resign the office of the acting Governor within three days beware, for on the fourth from this date you will be dead, stabbed in the heart.”
From then on, Metropolitan Police officers began guarding the acting governor.
Over the next few hours, the situation at the garrison escalated slowly. As soon as the Metropolitan Police chief left, the militia sent out men to guard the entrance. When they appeared the Metro officers cocked their Winchesters—and took aim. No one was getting in or out. Rations were passed in through a window at the rear of the building.
Two hours later the police were ordered back to a nearby station house. Rumors spread that they were preparing to assault the building at three o’clock in the morning.
President Grant had been reluctant to interfere in a state matter. But he finally relented now that lives were at stake. Attorney General Williams sent a telegraph to Kellogg confirming it. “You are recognized by the President as the lawful executive of Louisiana, and the body assembled at Mechanics Institute is the lawful legislature of the State...all necessary assistance will be given to you...to protect the state from disorder and violence.”
He sent a similar telegraph to McEnery, telling him bluntly not to bother sending the delegation. The president’s decision is made, he wrote, “and will not be changed.”
That was devastating to their cause. Warmoth was irate, comparing Grant to the king of Great Britain, who had imposed his will on the colonies. These messages were proof that the conspiracy to overthrow the State government was rooted in Washington. A reporter described Warmoth as “somewhat despairing. ‘There was never a more wicked outrage consummated,’ said he, with much feeling. ‘I saw men, strong men, weep tonight at their helplessness to avert the awful future open to them. Louisiana is irredeemably ruined unless relieved...’”
Grant’s action was debated across the nation. The Chicago Times reported, “The quarrel now seems to be whether the people of the State have the right to govern themselves, or whether the troops of the United States can step in and elect who shall legislate for the State... The military power seems to be the stronger of the two.”
With the debate seemingly decided, the Metropolitan Police stood down. The city breathed.
Most members of the Democrats’ committee had decided to go to Washington even after Grant’s telegram had arrived; if they couldn’t change the president’s mind they would try to find support in the Congress. As one delegate remembered, “Thousands and thousands of people assembled around the [railroad] cars when we left, to bid us ‘God speed.’ It was the most mournful assemblage I ever saw.”
At almost the same moment the train was picking up steam Union Brigadier General W. H. Smith went to the arsenal. He was there to demand the militia’s surrender, he announced, and if necessary would use troops to enforce that order. The president had authorized him to “use all necessary force to preserve the peace.” The militia commander replied that to prevent bloodshed, his men would leave the building.
Soon afterward, to great cheers from supporters, the militia marched proudly out of the armory.
While it would be several decades before superstitious Americans would consider Friday the 13th a risky day, it proved to be bad luck for Warmoth. In Washington, the Supreme Court threw out his lawyers’ request for a writ prohibiting Pinchback from accepting the returns from the Lynch Board. The Court ruled it simply did not have the legal right to interfere in state politics.
Anticipating legal action, newly appointed Governor Pinchback had nominated a new slate of judges and government officials. That turned out to be crucial once Eighth District Court Judge Elmore found Pinchback guilty of “repeated and continued contempt” for ignoring his injunction and ordered that he be arrested and imprisoned for ten days and fined fifty dollars. He ignored that ruling and, when a sheriff’s deputy tried to serve the writ, informed him that a day earlier the legislature had abolished the Eighth Court. The court ceased to exist, Elmore was no longer a judge and his injunction was worthless. As the New York Times informed its readers on its front page, “The presence of the United States soldiers rather dampened the ardor of the would-be deputy and he hastily retired, considering discretion the better part of valor.”
Similar scenes were taking place throughout the city and state as men declared elected by the Lynch Returning Board took their seats or offices. It was not always peaceful. A substantial number of Warmoth supporters had squeezed into Judge Monroe’s Third District courtroom after he had made it known he was not going to be removed. When newly elected Judge Meunier stood to be recognized and present his commission, Monroe refused to surrender the bench. The Lynch Board returns were “untrue and illegal,” he said, and it was his duty to maintain possession of that bench on behalf of the people of Louisiana who had elected him. Meunier’s attorney told Judge Monroe in the politest legal language that he had no case, and if it became necessary the sheriff—the duly elected sheriff—would remove him by force.
Judge Monroe fought back. “I command the Sheriff....not to obey... If he does so he is assisting those who are subverting the Government and overthrowing the temple of liberty!” When the deputy sheriff ordered him to step down, the judge said he wanted it known he was not vacating the bench but being compelled to by force. “You have taken the courtroom, books and archives,” he said bitterly, “and the responsibility is yours. The right to these things remains in me and in the people of this state.”
Other people had to choose between loyalty and a job. Civil Sheriff Harper, for example, had been appointed to the position by Warmoth. Pinchback offered him a new commission in the same post—and to the disdain of the Warmoth people he accepted it. That made him a Pinchback man. He had to switch sides to keep the same job.
The confusion was almost impossible to sort out in the two legislatures. Warmoth was a realist. He knew the Lyceum legislature could not pass or execute any laws, but believed it was vital to keep it intact until all legal and political avenues were exhausted. Perhaps more important, and far more dangerous, was the fact that at least half or maybe even more of the population supported Warmoth’s legislature. Whether its actions were legally codified, they would obey those decisions. They believed strongly they had been cheated out of victory, and they were not going to concede.
The makeup of the two bodies changed daily. Sometimes hourly. Both sides had difficulty raising a quorum. Secret inducements were offered and sometimes accepted, resulting in a continuous flow of senators and representatives moving back and forth across the street.
After a couple of weeks, Warmoth’s so-called people’s legislature concluded its “special session,” announcing it would meet in the regular session scheduled for January. When it closed, several senators went across the street and joined the so-called Bayonet legislature—identified by that name because it was meeting with the protection of armed soldiers—so they actually were listed as members of both groups.
The Bayonet legislature stayed in session, fearful if they left the State House at the Mechanics Institute vacant, Warmoth’s people would take possession. Much of its work consisted of approving nominees for government positions or dealing with budgetary issues, among them an appropriation to reimburse members for travel to and from the special session. They also met to consider the ongoing impeachment effort but, at the request of Warmoth’s counsel, agreed to postpone the trial till early January.
But the assembly suddenly took an unexpected turn, passing extremely controversial laws restricting the constitutional rights of people to bear arms and to assemble in protest.
These were breathtaking pieces of legislation. These rights were bedrock principles on which the country was founded. The “Act to suppress riotous and unlawful assemblies” was passed primarily to prevent the people’s legislature from meeting, but it had far greater consequences. The first part of the bill prohibited “three or more people being armed with clubs or other dangerous weapons...with intent to disturb the public peace” from acting together. The second clause made it illegal for “ten or more persons to unlawfully assemble...for an unlawful purpose.”
Intent was not defined, leaving it to local law enforcement to make that determination. As a reporter pointed out, the definition might include three men with walking sticks standing peacefully in conversation on a corner, leaving it up to law enforcement to decide if they constituted a danger.
Another bill granted the governor the right to disband the militia and seize its weapons if its officers refuse to obey his orders. This was done to prevent a repeat of the embarrassing siege of the armory. The legislature handed enormous power to the state executive.
The Warmoth media was irate. “No intents are cognizable by law,” the Times-Picayune wrote. “The constitution not only guarantees ‘the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,’ but makes it the duty of the Government of the United States to provide for ‘arming’ them as militia ‘necessary to secure the security of a free state.’... Their appeal to arms may, however, show not only their consciousness of wrong, but the fears wrong always engenders...”
These bills would be tested on January 6, when Warmoth’s legislature was scheduled to convene. No one knew if Pinchback would attempt to prevent that from happening. The city prepared for what seemed like an unavoidable, violent confrontation. McEnery issued a statement asking his supporters to act with prudence, dignity, firmness and moderation. Be calm, he pleaded. “In the midst of...an attempted overthrow of your liberties by an organized conspiracy, show to the people of the United States a dignity of bearing...for the maintenance of your liberties and constitutional rights... The government of the United States will not exert its great power to put down and suppress peaceable assemblies...”
But in case fighting did erupt, more than a thousand infantry troops and one cavalry company stationed in Baton Rouge quickly moved into the city “to preserve peace.”
Early on the morning of the sixth “there was considerable stir throughout the city.” At nine thirty a cavalry regiment made a public show, marching up Royal Street to the barracks on Magazine Street. A rumor that troops had occupied Lafayette Square proved unfounded. By ten thirty an estimated fifteen thousand people filled all the streets around the squares to protect the McEnery legislature. No one was even sure where they would meet; the city council had refused to allow them to continue using Lyceum Hall. Several other large spaces also had turned them down. Finally, at noon, fourteen senators and forty-seven representatives took possession of Odd Fellows Hall. The first thing that body did was hang an American flag out the window.
The soldiers stayed in their barracks. A token police force mostly stayed away from the area. There were no incidents. Within minutes the legislature adjourned as it did not have a quorum. But the point had been made. Warmoth still had fight left.
The breakdown of the electoral process and its impact on democracy had become major news in every city and town in the country and had even spread to Europe. The whole glorious American experiment in self-government was being tested—and seemed to be failing. No one had anticipated the collapse of the electoral system, so no one knew how to proceed. Newspapers as far away as the London Morning Post reported the story as it developed.
“There is no city in the United States so unique and interesting as is New Orleans,” the Morning Post wrote as it attempted to explain this complicated situation to British readers. “No city in America has so great a variety of inhabitants as this, with such striking contrasts as manners, language and complexion...a population remarkable for personal beauty, for gaiety of disposition, and for hotness of temper...
“The elections were held and the two sets of returns in due time arrived at the capital. Those sent to the supervisors to the Governor gave to M’Enery a majority of about 10,000; but those forwarded to the marshal by his deputies not only were accompanied by affidavits from 4,000 Negro voters setting forth that they had been unlawfully prevented from voting, but showed a majority for Kellogg of 14,000 or, including the extended votes, 18,
