By adhering to the principles of the CIA triad, organizations can develop comprehensive information security policies and implement robust security controls. These measures are designed to deal with threats and risks to the CIA of sensitive information and research data.
These are the objectives to be considered when securing a network:

Confidentiality: It ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals or entities, preventing unauthorized access or disclosure. Data encryption, access control, authentication methods, authorization mechanisms, and physical security measures serve as tools to uphold confidentiality. Data confidentiality is typically associated with sensitive personal information, such as customer names, contact information, and payment card details. These particulars must be stored within appropriate databases and restricted in accessibility, ensuring only authorized individuals can access them as required.
Integrity: Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered, safeguarding against unauthorized modifications. Backups, checksums, data correcting codes, availability are tools to uphold integrity. Data integrity extends beyond personal information and can also include corporate data. For example, an organization must guarantee the accuracy of product prices listed on their e-commerce platform.
Availability: It ensures that information and resources are consistently accessible and usable when needed, minimizing disruptions and downtime. Physical protections and computational redundancies are tools to uphold integrity. An organization’s systems, applications and data must be accessible to authorized users on demand. If, for example, the organization faces a power failure, its operations will be halted. Likewise, if cyber criminals encrypt the organization’s files in a ransomware attack, they will face major disruption:

Basic concepts of cryptography and steganography
Cryptography uses the power of mathematics to transform sensitive information into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using encryption algorithms. It includes the development and scrutiny of protocols designed to prevent attempts by malicious third parties to intercept information exchanged between two parties. Secure communication denotes a state wherein messages or data exchanged between two parties are inaccessible to adversaries. Cryptography achieves secure communication by transforming data into an unreadable format, accessible only to the intended recipient who possesses the necessary decryption key. The role of adversaries necessitates robust cryptographic techniques. These adversaries aim to breach InfoSec by compromising data confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity. Cryptographers work on creating robust systems that can prevent attacks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information.
The following are the advantages of cryptography:

Security: Provides a robust mechanism for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and manipulation.
Privacy: Safeguards individual privacy by encrypting personal data, communications, and transactions.
Trustworthiness: Enhances trust between communicating parties by verifying identities and ensuring data integrity.
Compliance: Helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements and standards related to data protection and privacy.
Versatility: Applicable across various domains, including finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and government, among others.
Flexibility: Offers a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and techniques to adapt to evolving security needs and threats.
Global communication: Facilitates secure communication and collaboration across geographical boundaries and diverse networks.

Steganography is a technique used to conceal confidential information by integrating it within various types of files, such as audio, video, images, or text. It serves as a means to safeguard sensitive data from potential threats and unauthorized access. Data hidden through steganography may undergo encryption before being embedded within another file format. If encryption is not employed, additional processing may be applied to the data to increase the difficulty of detection.
Steganography operates by hiding secret information within files, such as images, audio clips, videos, or text documents. This process involves embedding the hidden data into the carrier file in a manner that is invisible to the human eye or ear, preserving the overall integrity and appearance of the file. Various techniques can be employed to achieve this, including altering the least significant bits of pixel values in images, manipulating audio frequencies, or embedding text within whitespace or unused portions of a document. In some cases, the hidden data may be encrypted before being embedded to enhance security. Decoding the hidden information typically requires knowledge of the specific steganographic technique used and may involve extracting the hidden data and decrypting it if encryption was applied. Steganography is a valuable tool for both legitimate purposes, such as digital watermarking and copyright protection, as well as illicit activities, like information smuggling.
In digital communication, steganography can be categorized into five primary types:

Text steganography is hiding information inside a text file.
Image steganography is hiding information within an image file.
Audio steganography is hiding secret messages being embedded into an audio signal.
Video steganography is hiding within digital video formats.
Network steganography is hiding information within network control protocols utilized for data transmission.
