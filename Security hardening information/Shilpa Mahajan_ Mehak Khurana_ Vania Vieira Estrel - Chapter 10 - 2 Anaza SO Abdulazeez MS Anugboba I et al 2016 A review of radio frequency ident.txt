5.1 Introduction
As internet has become an essential part of today’s lifestyle or generation, all the organizations and businesses have moved to digital frameworks to expand their business so that it can reach each corner of the world. At the same time as majority of the business has moved to digital frameworks, it is has become vulnerable to cyberattacks, which are increasing day by day and business suffers huge reputation as well as revenue. As per reports [1], United States found that nearly a quarter of companies that have experienced a cyberattack have lost between 50,000 and 99,999 US dollars. Among the surveyed companies, another 22% reported losing between 100,000 and 499,999 US dollars. Overall, four percent have lost more than 1 million US dollars in a cyberattack. The count is much more in the global market. Over the past couple of years, particularly, IT companies had developed strategies for assessing their Infrastructure, Digital Systems be it Web Applications or Mobile Applications, Network Devices, Source Code (through DevSecOps implementation) etc., engaging in Red and Blue Teaming activities, to ensure if all their ecosystem is secure enough and is safe to bring those systems over the internet. However, today’s IT business doesn’t rely only on the internal security assessment or framework that an organization is following. Let’s consider an example: Suppose Organization “X” is bidding a project for a banking project from CUSTOMER “Y” which can significantly add to Organization’s “X” revenue. As the project is from Banking/Financial sector, it would take significant efforts to convivence Customer “Y” regarding security frameworks that the organization is following w.r.t quality and control measures. Here Cybersecurity Rating platforms come into picture, which can assess the Organization’s “X” security in terms of various parameters like “Application Security, Network Security, End Point Security, IP Reputation.” The ratings given by these platforms can play a significant role in the business, as achieving a good score or grade through these platforms can help convince customers to engage in project or to sign a deal, particularly in a project which requires greater level of security into consideration. Nowadays, many IT organizations to gain business are enrolling themselves in these Cybersecurity Rating platforms, to gain business and companies put constant efforts to maintain good score/grade or ratings from these platforms. As mentioned above in this section these Cybersecurity Rating platforms [2] tools assess the Organization’s security in terms of various parameters like “Application Security, Network Security, End Point Security, IP Reputation,” the organization enrolls to these tools, these platforms automatically figure out the scope and run several test cases on constant basis and they report vulnerabilities/misconfiguration details w.r.t above mentioned parameters.
