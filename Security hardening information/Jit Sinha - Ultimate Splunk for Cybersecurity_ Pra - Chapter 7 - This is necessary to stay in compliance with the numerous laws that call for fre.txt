Leveraging Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Compliance Efforts
By automating data analysis, seeing trends and abnormalities, and forecasting future hazards, machine learning (ML) can dramatically enhance an organization’s compliance efforts. An illustration of how machine learning can be used to help enforce compliance with a particular legislation, such as the General Data Protection legislation (GDPR), is provided below:
Step 1: Define the compliance goal
Identify the specific GDPR compliance obligations that the firm needs to pay attention to, such as tracking user access to personal data, spotting potential data breaches, and making sure data subject access requests (DSARs) are handled promptly.
Step 2: Gather and prepare the data
Pre-process the data by cleaning, converting, and aggregating it to make it acceptable for machine learning analysis by gathering relevant data from multiple sources within the enterprise, such as logs, databases, and apps.
Step 3: Pick the best machine learning algorithms
Select suitable ML techniques that can assist in achieving the specified compliance objectives. The handling of DSARs can be automated with the use of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, clustering algorithms, anomaly detection algorithms, and other techniques. For instance, clustering methods can be used to spot trends in user access.
Step 4: Train and verify the ML models
Utilize the pre-processed data to train the chosen ML models, and then use a different dataset to confirm their effectiveness. Adjust the models as needed to maximize performance and guarantee precise forecasts.
Step 5: Include ML models in the workflow for compliance
Utilize tools like the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to integrate the learned ML models into the organization’s compliance workflow. To monitor the real-time outputs of the ML models and set up alerts and warnings for potential compliance issues, bespoke dashboards, and visualizations may be created.
Step 6: Automate corrective measures
To automate the execution of remediation steps in response to compliance-related issues, combine the ML-powered compliance monitoring with automation tools like Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms. This can ensure a prompt response and lessen the effect of potential infringement.
Step 7: Keep track of, assess, and improve the ML models
Keep an eye on the ML models’ performance, assess how well they achieve the compliance goals, and make adjustments as necessary. This can entail updating the models to reflect changes in the regulatory environment or retraining the models with fresh data.
By automating data analysis, spotting patterns and abnormalities in user access to personal data, identifying potential data breaches, and automating the response to DSARs, machine learning is used in this case to enforce GDPR compliance. The firm may greatly enhance its GDPR compliance efforts, lower the risk of non-compliance fines, and safeguard the personal information of its users and customers by incorporating ML models into its compliance workflow and automating remediation steps.
Case Studies

Financial Services Organization: A large financial services organization used Splunk to automate the monitoring and reporting of their PCI DSS compliance efforts. By leveraging Splunk’s data analytics capabilities and pre-built PCI DSS dashboards, the organization gained real-time visibility into their cardholder data environment and was able to quickly identify and remediate potential issues, ultimately reducing the risk of non-compliance and data breaches.
Healthcare Provider: A healthcare provider implemented Splunk to meet HIPAA compliance requirements by monitoring access to protected health information (PHI) and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. Using Splunk, the organization was able to detect unauthorized access to PHI, identify potential data breaches, and generate compliance reports for auditing purposes.
Government Contractor: A government contractor leveraged Splunk to comply with NIST 800-171 requirements by monitoring the security of controlled unclassified information (CUI) in their non-federal systems. With Splunk’s NIST Compliance add-on and custom visualizations, the contractor gained real-time insights into their security posture, identified vulnerabilities, and ensured the proper implementation of required security controls.

These case studies demonstrate how organizations across various industries can leverage Splunk’s powerful data analytics capabilities, pre-built apps and add-ons, and integration options to meet their compliance and regulatory requirements more efficiently and effectively.
Conclusion
We have explored many aspects of how Splunk navigates the intricate web of regulatory requirements throughout this chapter. We began with a summary of these complex standards before moving on to a thorough analysis of Splunk’s contribution to maintaining compliance, covering details like data retention, encryption, monitoring, role-based access control, and incident response. We also looked at how continuous improvement, automation, and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence could be used to boost the effectiveness of compliance initiatives. Case studies provided real-world illustrations of Splunk’s capabilities in this area, which supplemented our conversation. As this chapter comes to a conclusion, it should be clear that Splunk is more than simply a tool; it also serves as a strategic partner in improving and strengthening an organization’s compliance posture.
In the following chapter, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) with Splunk, we will examine how these Splunk features work together as a single entity to combat security threats, orchestrating, automating, and responding to security incidents, ensuring a resilient and effective defense against potential vulnerabilities.
