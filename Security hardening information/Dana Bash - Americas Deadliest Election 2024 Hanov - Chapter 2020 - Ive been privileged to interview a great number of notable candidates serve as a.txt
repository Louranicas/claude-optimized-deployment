Book: Dana Bash - America's Deadliest Election (2024, Hanover Square Press) - libgen.li
Chapter: 2020 - I’ve been privileged to interview a great number of notable candidates, serve as a moderator for multiple significant debates over the years, and now anchor and coanchor two programs on CNN.
My feelings about covering elections haven’t changed at all. I still love it. Maybe even more than ever before. That is certainly one reason the election we write about in this book resonated so strongly with me.
While the structure is the same, every election has its own set of issues that appeal to or repel voters, personalities that captivate the public, and general rhythms and cadences defined by both the calendar and the world around us.
But few elections are as unique or have had the lasting impact on America as Louisiana’s 1872 gubernatorial election.
Until we began our research, I am embarrassed to say that I knew virtually nothing about this incredibly consequential election that took place a century and a half ago. It turns out that few people do. But as I began learning the details, it brought me new understanding to the most memorable interview I have ever done.
In 2018, I spoke with legendary civil rights leader John Lewis as we stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. On that bridge more than fifty years earlier, Lewis was beaten almost to death during the historic march to Montgomery in a quest to earn the most basic fundamental right for African Americans—the right to vote.
While I certainly didn’t know it at that time, there exists a direct connection between this long-forgotten 1872 election in Louisiana and the inspirational life of John Lewis. The election in question had a negative impact on the lives of Black voters all across the South who had a chance for real freedom after the Civil War and Reconstruction that followed, but instead became disenfranchised and systemically discriminated against for more than a century.
Its echoes are still felt today.
Louisiana’s 1872 gubernatorial election is also a cautionary tale because of the astonishing parallels between that election and some of the events, players and words used in American politics today.
There are direct quotes on these pages, statements made more than a hundred and fifty years ago, that easily could have been spoken by today’s politicians. But those parallels only tell half the story; it is what happened afterward that is chilling.
The events that took place in the four years following the 1872 election not only escalated into a national dispute that resulted in the controversial presidential election of 1876, an election literally decided by one man, it also led to the Supreme Court decision that essentially ended Reconstruction and legalized the segregated society that would bring John Lewis to the Edmund Pettus Bridge more than a century later.
Democracy has often been referred to as an experiment. This is the story of what happened—and what can happen again—when that experiment fails.

A person might quickly run out of adjectives trying to describe New Orleans. In the fall of 1872, it seemed as if all the rivers of history had flowed together to create a place unlike anywhere else in the world. The city’s contradictions gave it a unique and colorful character: big and loud and majestic; dirty and dangerous and chaotic. It was melodious and raucous; the music never stopped, but neither did the violence. It was renowned for its continental sophistication, boasting theater, opera and masked balls, yet it had only four paved roads, and sewage flowed through the streets.
The mighty Mississippi had made New Orleans and with it Louisiana an economic powerhouse, supplying almost half of the nation’s cotton, yet the state was many millions of dollars in debt. Before the Civil War, the city’s location made it the doorway from the Gulf of Mexico to the American midlands and thus America’s largest slave market, but it also was home to the greatest number of free Black citizens and freed slaves in the South.
Since Europeans first claimed it in 1717, the Louisiana Territory had been under French, Spanish and British rule before finally being purchased by the United States in
