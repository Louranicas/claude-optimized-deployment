The given set of data points were used for evaluating the performance of the model in the context of DL-IDS computational requirement. Being evaluated on both the balanced and imbalanced datasets, we got to find the significant differences in the prediction time for each model on the datasets. For the balanced dataset, the prediction times varied notably compared to those of the imbalanced dataset.

4.7 Discussion
An overview of IBN as an innovative networking framework has been discussed, and in addition, a proposed methodology with the incorporation of ML and DL algorithms for an advanced IDS that can be incorporated into both traditional and IBN network infrastructure has been reviewed. The model consists of four models that were trained on two datasets: an imbalanced and a balanced dataset. Providing a detailed record of the performance of each model across various metrics on these datasets, as shown in Table 4.1, the model is deemed reliable, although subject to the type of network and the integration of the model in real-time network traffic. The findings from this study represent a paradigm shift in network security tactics. The network’s capacity to recognize and respond to security threats has been greatly improved by utilizing these algorithms. Though it is hard to determine which model is best suited for the desired objective, each model’s performance is outstanding. We considered various key points to note to determine which model is best.
A key point to note is that the network traffic, as regards the imbalanced dataset, isn’t always balanced due to the nature of the traffic. There is a very high chance that the network has a higher record for the class “Normal” than the class “Attack.. Even though the class is imbalanced, it is considerable to note that this is very close to real-time captured network traffic when compared to a balanced class of “normal” and “attack.” In addition, the complexity of each model about prediction time has also been reviewed. The four algorithms—Random Forest Classifier, 1D CNN, Stacked LSTM, and Hybrid Model—have obtained outstanding results. It is noteworthy to understand that the greater the complexity of the model, the greater the prediction time. Utilizing the Friedman-Tukey rank index, 1D CNN on the imbalanced dataset has been proven to be very efficient, with a lesser prediction time when compared to the other DL models. In an observative measure, ID CNN is faster and less computationally expensive when compared to the hybrid model (which achieved a close similar performance) in terms of number of trainable parameters, training time, and prediction time over various range of data points. In intrusion scenarios, the main objective is to detect intrusion as early as possible to prevent adverse post-actions, and in that sense, ID CNN has proven very effective in terms of less trainable parameters and prediction timings, therefore making it a lightweight model. Reactive measures, or responding to risks after they have occurred, are the usual approach used in traditional security systems. The DL-enabled IBN, in contrast, foresees future dangers, enabling prompt preventative steps. This initiative-taking approach not only protects the network but also inspires trust in the stakeholders of the company. Since ML algorithms can be continually improved, they are resilient to new security threats.


4.8 Conclusion and Future Scope
This research significantly advances the field of network security by demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating ML and DL algorithms into IBN systems. By meticulously evaluating various advanced ML models, our study not only confirms their high accuracy in anomaly detection but also highlights their potential for real-time, proactive security measures in dynamic network environments. This novel integration allows for continuous, intelligent monitoring, ensuring robust protection against evolving cyber threats. Our findings move the body of knowledge forward by establishing a new standard for leveraging ML-driven IBN to enhance network resilience and security, offering businesses a reliable framework to safeguard digital infrastructures in an increasingly interconnected world. These intent-based networks will utilize ML algorithms to enhance network security. DL-driven IBN proactively identifies and mitigates security issues, ensuring high accuracy in anomaly detection. This strategy improves network efficiency and encourages customer and stakeholder confidence. The research proposal focuses on integrating ML and DL algorithms into IBN systems to enhance network and data security. The proposed approach uses advanced ML algorithms to detect intricate network activities and generalize network behavior. The integration of refined ML models into IBN architecture enables real-time monitoring, enabling swift and precise detection of abnormalities. This research contributes significantly to the advancement of network security in modern technological landscapes.
Future research should build on this foundation by exploring more sophisticated intrusion strategies, further refining the models’ ability to adapt to complex and evolving threat landscapes.
