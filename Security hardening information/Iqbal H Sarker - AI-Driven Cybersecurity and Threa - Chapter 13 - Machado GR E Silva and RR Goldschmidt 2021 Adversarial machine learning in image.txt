2.1 Introduction 
The digital world today has become integral to our lives, transforming the way 
we communicate, work, and conduct business. However, this digital transformation 
comes with a dark underbelly–the world of cyber threats. The ﬁeld of cybersecurity 
has emerged as a critical safeguard for individuals, organizations, and governments 
in response to this omnipresent danger. Our digital interconnectedness has made 
knowledge more vital than ever in an era when digital vulnerabilities can disrupt 
businesses, compromise personal information, and even compromise national secu-
rity. As a foundational exploration of cybersecurity, this chapter explores key terms; 
attack frameworks, such as kill chains and MITRE ATT&CK; and the cybersecurity 
life cycle. This chapter serves as an essential primer for anyone seeking to navigate 
this complex and ever-evolving landscape.

22 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
The core of cybersecurity is a multifaceted discipline that requires a solid 
understanding of terminology, knowledge of threats, and the ability to implement 
comprehensive defense strategies. The journey begins with demystifying the ter-
minology associated with cybersecurity and AI [ 1]. We recognize that the ﬁeld is 
replete with technical jargon, acronyms, and concepts that can seem intimidating 
to those newly introduced to the subject. To bridge this knowledge gap, we break 
down the fundamental terminologies used in cybersecurity, making it accessible 
and comprehensible to readers at all levels of expertise related to cybersecurity and 
emerging technologies associated with AI. For those new to the ﬁeld, this chapter 
provides a foundational understanding of key concepts such as vulnerabilities, 
threats, risks, incident response, authentication, and more. The chapter also explores 
prominent attack frameworks, such as kill chains and MITRE ATT&CK, discussed 
in detail in a later section. The frameworks provide valuable insights into the 
anatomy of cyber threats, facilitating the comprehension, analysis, and effective 
countermeasures of malicious activity. 
There are numerous risks associated with the digital or cyber world, from 
commonplace malware and phishing attacks to highly sophisticated and targeted 
threats that constantly evolve. Figure 2.1 shows an illustration of cybercrimes 
highlighting the cyber-physical world. As part of this chapter, we dive deeper into 
the real-world application of cyberattacks. By exploring common attack vectors, 
dissecting real-world case studies, and shedding light on the methods cybercriminals 
employ to compromise digital systems, we offer insight into the methods they use to 
inﬁltrate, manipulate, and compromise digital systems. Having this understanding

is invaluable not just to cybersecurity professionals, but also to anyone dealing 
with the ever-changing digital landscape. To enable readers to make informed 
decisions regarding the security of digital assets and data, this chapter provides 
them with the background knowledge and insight they need. Moreover, this chapter 
discusses the cybersecurity life cycle as a structured approach to managing and 
enhancing cybersecurity. It provides organizations with a systematic process for 
identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering from cybersecurity 
incidents. Adapting cybersecurity practices to the framework can help organizations 
develop robust and adaptive security postures. 
Overall, understanding necessary terminologies, attack frameworks, and the 
security life cycle is crucial to ensuring the best defense against cyberattacks. 
Whether someone is an IT professional, a business leader, a citizen concerned about 
cybersecurity, or simply curious about it, this chapter provides the foundational 
knowledge and practical insights needed to navigate it. The lessons and knowledge 
provided here are indispensable for securing our digital future in an era when phys-
ical and digital worlds are increasingly intertwined. Upon exploring cybersecurity 
terminologies, attacks, and life cycles, it becomes clear that the digital era requires 
a comprehensive understanding of technology’s beneﬁts as well as its risks. Our 
goal is thus to ensure that individuals are empowered with the knowledge and tools 
they need to navigate the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape and safeguard their 
digital assets. We all beneﬁt from the insights discussed, whether we are trying to 
secure ourselves personally, protect our businesses, or contribute to the security of 
our interconnected world. 
2.2 Understanding Key T erminologies 
In this section, we explore key terminologies within the context of cybersecurity and 
emerging technologies associated with AI. 
2.2.1 Cybersecurity 
For individuals who are unfamiliar with the realm of cybersecurity, the extensive use 
of technical phrases and terminology can frequently seem confusing. Understanding 
these terms is essential since they serve as the foundation for developing cyberse-
curity strategies and evaluating threat levels. A list of key cybersecurity terms is 
provided below to help explain this complicated ﬁeld: 
• Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, 
netw orks, and data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious 
activities or threats [ 3, 4]. For example, we can consider a national power 
infrastructure that provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses. To
24 2 Cybersecurity Background Knowledge: Terminologies, Attack Frameworks. . .
defend against cyberattacks on this critical infrastructure, strong cybersecurity 
measures are essential. Thus, the power grid can ensure an uninterrupted supply 
of electricity, protect against potential outages, and maintain the stability of a 
country’s energy supply, thereby ensuring public safety and economic continuity. 
• Threat: A threat is a potential danger or harmful event that can exploit a 
vulnerability in a system or organization. Threats can be intentional (e.g., 
cyberattacks by hackers) or unintentional (e.g., natural disasters). Malware, such 
as a computer virus or ransomware, is a threat, which has the potential to exploit 
vulnerabilities in computer systems and cause harm. 
• Vulnerability: Vulnerabilities are ﬂaws or weaknesses in systems, networks, and 
applications that can be exploited by threat actors. Errors in design, conﬁguration, 
or implementation can lead to vulnerabilities. A cybercriminal can exploit this 
vulnerability and launch an attack, like infecting a computer with malware or 
gaining unauthorized access to a system. 
• Attack: An attack is the actual exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat actor 
to compromise or damage a system, network, or data. An attack is therefore the 
execution of an attack’s intent. An example of a distributed denial of service 
(DDoS) attack is when a network of compromised devices overwhelms a target 
system or network with excessive trafﬁc, preventing the users from accessing it. 
Several common cyberattacks are listed in Fig. 2.
