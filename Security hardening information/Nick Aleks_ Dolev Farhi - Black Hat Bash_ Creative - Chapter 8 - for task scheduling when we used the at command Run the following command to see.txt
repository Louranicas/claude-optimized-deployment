for task scheduling when we used the at command. Run the following command to see SetUID and SetGID:
$ ls -l /usr/bin/at

-rwsr-sr-x 1 daemon daemon 59768 Oct 15 /usr/bin/at

Here, you can see that SetUID is set, as indicated by the first s in the permissions, followed by SetGID, as indicated by the second s. Thus, when users run the at command, they run it with the permissions of the daemon user and group.
Another example of a command that uses the SetUID set to its executable is passwd, which changes account passwords. Executables set with SetUID and SetGID can be a security risk and are a prime target for privilege escalation. We will demonstrate an exploitation example in “Exploiting a SetUID Misconfiguration” on page
