For illustration purposes, we have also included in the table an implementation example for each subcategory. These examples were selected from the Implementation Example document published alongside CSF. This type of detailed information is particularly relevant for defense training, as trainees can use it to define actionable strategies for achieving a certain goal.Table 6.12Overview of the subcategories for the Platform Security category in the CSF 2.0 frameworkIdSubcategory descriptionImplementation examplePR.PS-01Configuration management practices are established and appliedReview all default configuration settings that may potentially impact cybersecurity when installing or upgrading softwarePR.PS-02Software is maintained, replaced, and removed commensurate with riskPerform routine and emergency patching within the timeframes specified in the vulnerability management planPR.PS-03Hardware is maintained, replaced, and removed commensurate with riskReplace hardware when it lacks needed security capabilities or when it cannot support software with needed security capabilitiesPR.PS-04Log records are generated and made available for continuous monitoringConfigure all operating systems, applications, and services (including cloud-based services) to generate log recordsPR.PS-05Installation and execution of unauthorized software are preventedVerify the source of new software and the software’s integrity before installing itPR.PS-06Secure software development practices are integrated, and their performance is monitored throughout the software development life cycleProtect all components of organization-developed software from tampering and unauthorized access

6.3.2.2 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and OrganizationsThe U.S. NIST Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations guideline is a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations [10]. The term controls is used in this guideline to denote “descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and reflecting the protection needs of organizational stakeholders.”The controls mentioned above are intended as support for the protection of organizational operations and assets from a diverse set of threats and risks. These risks include hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. Although not all the aspects in this guideline are directly related to defense training, there are many relevant controls, and for this reason we will next briefly introduce its components.Control Families At the top level of this guideline are control families, which group all the controls related to a certain topic. There are currently 20 control families, and we present a selection of some of those most relevant for defense training in Table 6.
