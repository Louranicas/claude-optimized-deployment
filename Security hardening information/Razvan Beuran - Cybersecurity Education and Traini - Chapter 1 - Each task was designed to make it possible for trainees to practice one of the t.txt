Chapter: 1 - Each task was designed to make it possible for trainees to practice one of the techniques mentioned in that guide. This design principle enables organizers to make sure that they cover all the necessary techniques related to a given goal, such as security testing and assessment in this case. Other guidelines that we examined in the context of attack, forensics, and defense training could be used in a similar manner to design training content that is well targeted and effective.The content we created is organized into two sections that we named levels, so as to emphasize the gamification approach. Thus, the training activity starts with easier tasks for Level 1, and continues with more challenging ones for Level 2. The training content includes a total of 20 questions that provide an almost complete coverage of the types of techniques mentioned in the NIST guideline. An overview of the two levels is presented in Table 12.3, which also shows the task count per level; a more detailed description of each level follows.Table 12.3Overview of the gamified training content set created for CyTrONENameLevel descriptionCountLevel 1As the new sysadmin of a company, you are asked to investigate a suspected cybersecurity incident10Level 2As a follow-up assignment, you are now tasked with assessing the security of the company network10

Level 1 The first level of the gamified training content entrusts a new system administrator with the task of investigating a suspected cybersecurity incident that may have occurred recently. The story for this gamified scenario is conveyed to trainees in the description of the level, which is shown below.Today is your first day on the job as a sysadmin. Your boss tells you that he suspects somebody tried to hack into your company’s network, and asks you to investigate a possible cyberattack that may have happened when the system administrator was a guy called Daniel Craig. The boss sits you in front of the previous sysadmin’s computer, and wishes you good luck.To finish this assignment, trainees must answer a sequence of 10 questions that are ordered according to best practices for incident investigation. Answering each question makes it possible to move forward through the assignment, hence their order is also important from this point of view.For illustration purposes, the tasks in this level are summarized in Table 12.4, which also indicates the corresponding NIST assessment technique for each task. The tasks are designed to cover several important security assessment techniques from the NIST guideline technique categories named Review Techniques and Target Identification and Analysis Techniques, such as configuration review, log review, network discovery, and vulnerability scanning. Given that this level is considered to be an introductory one, only a single task in the higher-risk category Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques is included, namely password cracking.Level 2 The second level of the gamified training content set is a continuation of the first level, and it tasks the participants, who are assuming the same role of system administrator, with assessing the security of their company’s network. The description of this gamified scenario, as displayed to trainees in the Moodle interface, is shown below.Your boss invites you to his office and congratulates you for your achievements so far. He says he has a new task for you: investigating the security of the company network.You would have preferred to have a break—or even a short holiday—after completing your previous assignment, but security issues are not something that can wait, so you get back to your desk and start working again.This level too presents a sequence of 10 questions that the trainees must answer. As before, the tasks are ordered according to best practice considerations, and solving them in order allows participants to advance through the assignment.Some of the questions in Level 2 cover the Review Techniques and Target Identification and Analysis Techniques NIST guideline categories, such as ruleset review, documentation review, network sniffing, and wireless scanning. However, this level is targeting more advanced techniques as well, namely in the Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques category. Applying these techniques, such as password cracking, penetration testing, and even social engineering, makes it possible for trainees to have an experience similar to an actual pentesting engagement.

12.3.2.2 CTF-Style Training ContentThe second set of training content created for CyTrONE was designed in the style of CTF competition content. Note that the details that we provide below correspond to v1.1 of this training content set.Content Overview As it is typical for CTF content, the challenges in this training set are organized in several categories, namely Binary, Crypto, Network, OS, and Web. The training content is provided both in English and Japanese, and the total number of challenges included in this set is
