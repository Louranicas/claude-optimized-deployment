Chapter: 1 - For each tactic, we include its brief description, which explains what adversaries are trying to do when using a certain tactic, and a count of techniques that are included in that tactic. We note that the Defense Evasion and Discovery tactics include a very large number of techniques, emphasizing the large array of methods available to attackers in those two cases.Table 4.1Overview of the tactics in the ATT&CK knowledge baseNameTactic descriptionCountReconnaissanceThe adversary is trying to gather information they can use to plan future operations10Resource DevelopmentThe adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations8Initial AccessThe adversary is trying to get into your network10ExecutionThe adversary is trying to run malicious code14PersistenceThe adversary is trying to maintain their foothold20Privilege EscalationThe adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions14Defense EvasionThe adversary is trying to avoid being detected43Credential AccessThe adversary is trying to steal account names and passwords17DiscoveryThe adversary is trying to figure out your environment32Lateral MovementThe adversary is trying to move through your environment9CollectionThe adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal17Command and ControlThe adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them18ExfiltrationThe adversary is trying to steal data9ImpactThe adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data14
The order in which the tactics are presented in ATT&CK follows the generally accepted order of the steps in a cyberattack. For each tactic, the knowledge base also includes a detailed explanation regarding the scope of that tactic. For example, for the Lateral Movement (TA0008) tactic, the detailed explanation is as follows [7]:Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. Reaching their objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain. Adversaries might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or use legitimate credentials with native network and operating system tools, which may be stealthier.Readers will recognize some of tactic names in Table 4.1 as phases of the pentesting process discussed in Sect. 4.2.2. This is why by studying the information regarding a given tactic, trainees are able to learn practical information about how to execute the corresponding pentesting stage.Techniques On the second layer of the ATT&CK knowledge base are situated the attack techniques, with more than 600 techniques and sub-techniques being currently defined, where sub-techniques are sub-components of an attack technique that provide more specific information for a particular use case. By studying the techniques of interest, trainees are able to learn about practical attack mechanisms.Each tactic covers a set of techniques. For instance, the Lateral Movement tactic contains nine techniques, as shown in Table 4.2. Techniques do not have brief descriptions, only detailed explanations, as it will be explained below. The numbers shown in the table indicate how many sub-techniques each technique has. Most of the techniques in our example have no sub-techniques, but Remote Services, for instance, has eight, each referring to a specific remote service, such as Remote Desktop Protocol, SSH, VNC, and the way in which those specific services can be used as attack vectors.Table 4.2Overview of the techniques for the Lateral Movement tactic in the ATT&CK knowledge baseTechnique nameCountExploitation of Remote Services0Internal Spearphishing0Lateral Tool Transfer0Remote Service Session Hijacking2Remote Services8Replication Through Removable Media0Software Deployment Tools0Taint Shared Content0Use Alternate Authentication Material4
Similar to tactics, each technique is given an identifier,1 and includes an explanation of its scope. For example, the detailed explanation for the Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210) technique is as follows [7]:Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through Network Service Discovery or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities, or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB and RDP as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL and web server services.Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve Exploitation for Privilege Escalation as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.
Procedure Examples Another aspect of techniques in ATT&CK that is particularly useful from an attack training perspective is that many of them include examples of procedures, that is practical ways in which a particular type of attack technique was previously executed in the real world. Each such procedure includes not only a brief outline, but also references to technical reports that detail the attack mechanisms that were actually used.Table 4.3Overview of the mitigations for the Exploitation of Remote Services technique in the ATT&CK knowledge baseNameMitigation descriptionApplication Isolation and SandboxingMake it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing [...]Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramMinimize available services to only those that are necessaryExploit ProtectionSecurity applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior [...]Network SegmentationSegment networks and systems appropriately to reduce access to critical systems and services to controlled methodsPrivileged Account ManagementMinimize permissions and access for service accounts to limit impact of exploitationThreat Intelligence ProgramDevelop a robust cyber threat intelligence capability to determine what types and levels of threat may use software exploits and 0-days against a particular organizationUpdate SoftwareUpdate software regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise endpoints and serversVulnerability ScanningRegularly scan the internal network for available services to identify new and potentially vulnerable services
The Exploitation of Remote Services technique, for instance, includes more than 20 procedure examples. Some of them refer to higher-level strategies used by threat groups, such as APT28 (G0007), but many refer to actual software used to conduct a certain type of attack, such as Bad Rabbit (S0606). The current version of ATT&CK includes almost 800 references to such software. Procedure examples are, therefore, very valuable for the study of penetration testing techniques.Mitigations So far, we have focused on the information in the ATT&CK knowledge base that refers to offensive actions. However, the defined attack techniques also include lists of mitigations that can be used to counter those attack techniques in various manners. The current version of ATT&CK contains a total of 43 such mitigations in the Enterprise matrix. For example, the Exploitation of Remote Services technique mentions eight possible mitigations, as shown in Table 4.3, which provides a brief description for each mitigation (some descriptions were shortened for clarity).Mitigations, as well, use an identifier and include a detailed description of the mitigation mechanism, but also link back to all the attack techniques they are relevant with respect to. For instance, the mechanism for the Network Segmentation (M1030) mitigation is described as follows [7]:Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any Internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.To use the same mitigation example, Network Segmentation links back to more than 20 attack techniques. While such information is mostly useful from a defense perspective, trainees can also use it as reference for the type of defense mechanisms that are expected in a pentesting engagement for those attack techniques and try to consider appropriate ways of bypassing those countermeasures.Table 4.4Overview of the attack pattern categories for the Mechanisms of Attack view in the CAPEC knowledge baseNameAttack pattern category descriptionEngage in Deceptive InteractionsAttack patterns within this category focus on malicious interactions with a target in an attempt to deceive the target and convince the target that it is interacting with some other principal and as such take actions based on the level of trust that exists between the target and the other principalAbuse Existing FunctionalityAn adversary uses or manipulates one or more functions of an application in order to achieve a malicious objective not originally intended by the application, or to deplete a resource to the point that the target’s functionality is affectedManipulate Data StructuresAttack patterns in this category manipulate and exploit characteristics of system data structures in order to violate the intended usage and protections of these structuresManipulate System ResourcesAttack patterns within this category focus on the adversary’s ability to manipulate one or more resources in order to achieve a desired outcomeInject Unexpected ItemsAttack patterns within this category focus on the ability to control or disrupt the behavior of a target either through crafted data submitted via an interface for data input, or the installation and execution of malicious code on the target systemEmploy Probabilistic TechniquesAn attacker utilizes probabilistic techniques to explore and overcome security properties of the target that are based on an assumption of strength due to the extremely low mathematical probability that an attacker would be able to identify and exploit the very rare specific conditions under which those security properties do not holdManipulate Timing and StateAn attacker exploits weaknesses in timing or state maintaining functions to perform actions that would otherwise be prevented by the execution flow of the target code and processesCollect and Analyze InformationAttack patterns within this category focus on the gathering, collection, and theft of information by an adversarySubvert Access ControlAn attacker actively targets exploitation of weaknesses, limitations and assumptions in the mechanisms a target utilizes to manage identity and authentication as well as manage access to its resources or authorize functionality
Detection Most attack techniques also include information about how one could detect those attacks. In particular, the data sources and data components to be used, as well as the actual detection mechanism are specified. For instance, the Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210) technique mentions two data sources: Application Log and Network Traffic. In its turn, the description of how Network Traffic (DS0029) and its content can be used to detect T1210 attacks is as follows [7]:Use deep packet inspection to look for artifacts of common exploit traffic, such as known payloads.While attack detection information is again mostly useful from a defense perspective, trainees can also use it as reference for the types of detection mechanisms that are expected in a pentesting engagement, and try to determine the corresponding evasion methods they could employ.

4.3.1.2 CAPECCommon Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) is a list of known attack patterns that are employed by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in computer systems [8]. CAPEC too is managed by MITRE Corporation with the goal of providing a tool that can help security analysts, software developers, testers, and educators to gain a better understanding of the cyberattack patterns and improve their defense techniques. The content of CAPEC can be viewed in two main ways:Mechanisms of Attack: A view that organizes attack patterns hierarchically based on the most common mechanisms used to exploit a vulnerability, with each category representing different techniques employed to attack a system.Domains of Attack: A view that organizes attack patterns based on the attack domain, with the following six domains being defined: Software, Hardware, Communications, Supply Chain, Social Engineering, Physical Security.Attack Pattern Categories At the top level of each view of CAPECs are situated in the attack pattern categories. Thus, there are nine categories in the Mechanisms of Attack view, as shown in Table 4.
