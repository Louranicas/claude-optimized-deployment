2.8    Statistical Analysis of a Logging File (Bash)
The starting point for this example is a lo g file of a web server that has been ano-
nymized for privacy reasons. Each line of th is file is structured in the following way
(text wrapped for space reasons):
160.85.252.20 7--[05/Feb/2023:00:00:26 +0100]
"GET /research/business/only HTTP/1.1" 200 25158"https://example.com/less/response/edge/policy""Mozilla/5.0 ..."
In each case, the first column indicates th e IP address from which the website was con-
tacted. The script, which is unparalleled in its brevity, creates a list of the 20 most com-
mon IP addresses. The $1 character combination is the first parameter passed to the
script.
# Sample file ip-address-statistic.sh
c u t- d''- f1$ 1| sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -n 20
When you analyze the sample.log  file using this script, you’ ll get the following result:
$ ./ip-address-statistics.sh
6166 65d3:f5b9:e9e5:4b1c:331b:29f3:97c1:c18f
6048 3547:0b26:4c84:4411:0f66:945e:7741:d8875136 186.107.89.1284620 d741:a4ea:f6e1:6a17:78b1:1694:f518:c480
...
Therefore, 6,166 requests originated from IPv6 address 65d3:f5b9:...:c18f, etc. For a
detailed explanation of how the cut, grep , uniq , sort , and head  commands in this script
work, see Chapter 8 , Section 8.1 .
2.9    Uploading Files to  the Cloud (PowerShell)
The task for our penultimate example is to upload all image files in the current direc-
tory that have changed since the last time the script was run or that have been added
since then to a bucket on the Simple Storage Service (S3) cloud service from AmazonWeb Services (AWS).
472.10 Cloning Virtual Machines (Bash)
This PowerShell script assumes that the AWS.Tools.Common  and AWS.Tools.S3  modules
are installed and that the access data for the bucket has been stored with Set-AWSCre-
dential  for profile name MyProfile  (see also Chapter 20 , Section 20.3 ).
The if construction tests whether the last-run  file exists. If this file exists, the time of
the last change will be read. Then, the LastWriteTime  property is updated with the cur-
rent time. If the file does not exist, it will be created. This script  takes into account all
image files since January 1, 2000.
Next, Get-ChildItem  determines all image files in the current directory. Where-Object  fil-
ters out files that are ne w or have been modified. Write-S3Object  uploads these files to
an S3 bucket.
# Sample file upload-images-to-aws.ps1
if (Test-Path -Path "last-run") {
$lastRunTime = (Get-Item -Path "last-run").LastWriteTime
(Get-ChildItem "last-run").LastWriteTime = Get-Date
} else {
$lastRunTime = New-Object DateTime(2000, 1, 1)
New-Item "last-run" | Out-Null
}
Get-ChildItem -Path "*.jpg", "*.jpeg", "*.png" |
Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -gt $lastRunTime } |ForEach-Object {
Write-S3Object -BucketName "my.aws.bucket" `
-ProfileName "MyProfile" -File $_.Name -Key $_.Name
}
I must admit a little reluctantly that this sc ript just barely exceed s the ten-line promise
I made for this chapter.
2.10    Cloning Virtual Machines (Bash)
The last example is from server administrati on. One of my Linux servers is running the
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) virtuali zation system. At the beginning of each
semester, I create virtual machines with se quential numbers for all students attending
my Linux course. For example, the ./make-vms.sh  20 44 command results in 25 clones of
my base system being created, numbered vm20  through vm44 .
# Sample file make-vms.sh
orig='vm-base' # Name of the base VM to clone
for (( nr=$1; nr<=$2; nr++ )); do
echo "create vm-$nr"
disk=/var/lib/libvirt/images/vm-$nr-disk.qcow2
2 Ten Times Ten Lines
48virt-clone --name "vm-$nr" --original $orig \
--mac 52:54:00:01:00:$nr --file $disk
done
Although this script respects  the ten-line rule, I cheated a little. The “real” version of
this script tests whether two parameters we re really passed to the script, shuts down
the source virtual machine that may still be  running, sets up mult iple disks and multi-
ple network interfaces for each exercise VM, and more.
For basic principles and more details, refer to Chapter 21 , Section 21.1 .

Bash and Zsh
Bash  (Bourne  Again  Shell)  is the default shell of most Linux distributions. It performs
two tasks: On the one hand, it accepts comm ands in the terminal, executes these com-
mands, and displays their results. On  the other hand, Bash is considered the classic
scripting programming language. In this chap ter, I will only briefly discuss the interac-
tive application; instead, I'll focus on in troducing you to the main concepts behind
Bash.
As an alternative to Bash, Zsh is gainin g momentum. While the differences compared
to Bash in script programming are neglig ible, Zsh scores points with many small
improvements in interactive operations. Popular extensions (such as one called Oh My
Zsh) make Zsh even more comfortable and improve its appearance. On macOS, Zsh has
been the default shell since 20 19. On Linux, the switch from Bash to Zsh can be made in
a minute if necessary.
3.1    Terminal, Shell, and Bash
So far, some terms have appeared that I wa nt to explain again br iefly now. Let’s start
with the terminal: In this program, you can execute text-based commands. On Linux
and macOS, the existence of the terminal  was always a matter of course. While a termi-
nal program is available on macOS, there are countless programs to choose from on
Linux. The most common ones include gnome-terminal , the new console of the GNOME
Project (program name kgx), as well as konsole . Even on Windows, the Windows  Termi-
nal is available now.
Inside the terminal, the shell is running: Th is shell is a program that takes your text
input, executes the re sulting command, and displays the result back in text form. The
shell also provides a lot of ad ditional features that are not obvious at first glance: It can
redirect the results of a command to a file, link several commands together, and so on.
In the early history of Unix and Linux, sh ells have been developed multiple times:
Bourne Shell, C Shell, Bash, Dash, Zsh, and so on. However, this chapter only deals with
the two currently most popular shells—Bash and Zsh.

50Why the Separation between Terminal and Shell?
The nesting of terminal and shell seems conf using at first sight. This separation stems
from the fact that the terminal is only ne cessary when you work on a graphical desktop
system. But most operating systems can also be controlled in text mode or via a net-
work connection (SSH)—then the shell runs without  a terminal!
The separation between terminal and shell has a further advantage in that you can
combine your favorite terminal with your fa vorite shell, deviatin g from the default set-
tings of Linux or macOS. This freedom is es pecially important to Linux professionals.
3.1.1    Determining the Current Shell
To determine which shell is running on your machine, you must run the echo  $SHELL
command, which displays the contents of the $SHELL  variable that specifies the path to
your account’s default shell.  If the shell running is Bash, you can access its version
number with the second command, bash  --version .

3.2    Installation
Almost all Linux distributions have Bash prei nstalled. Thus, if you work on Linux, this

Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -gt $lastRunTime } |ForEach-Object {

3.2    Installation
Almost all Linux distributions have Bash prei nstalled. Thus, if you work on Linux, this
section is unnecessary. If your distribution uses Zsh, I recommend you keep using it for
its interactive features. However, to develop sc ripts that are as portable as possible, the
parallel installation of Bash is recommended . This parallel installation can be achieved
with the package management command fo r your distribution ; for example, on
Debian and Ubuntu, you would use sudo  apt install  bash .

macOS, Bash is expected to be removed enti rely. In this respect,  Zsh represents a com-
patible, and in many ways even better, repl acement. If you prefer Bash or use it for
script programming, the best approach is to set up the Homebrew  package manager
