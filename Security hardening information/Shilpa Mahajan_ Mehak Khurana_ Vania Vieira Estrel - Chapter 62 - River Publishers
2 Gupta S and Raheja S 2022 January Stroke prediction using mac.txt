3Artificial Intelligence Perspective on Digital Forensics

3.1 Introduction
Digital forensics is a vast field; it has to deal with systems and data that are associated with it. Intelligent digital forensics serves as a valuable technique for enhancing system security and analysis capabilities. It aids in the proactive management of information and computer vulnerabilities, thereby mitigating potential risks. In digital forensics, the dedicated investigator is required to collect or gather information and evidence while making sure no data or evidence is lost, harmed, or modified. The investigator then would have to make a report of all their findings. Preserving the digital evidence is a very important task in digital forensics, analyzing the digital evidence, and then making an analytic report of the investigation all fall under the field of digital forensics.
Consider the scenario in which Connie Debate, a woman, was fatally attacked in her residence in 2015 [1]. Her spouse, Richard, stated that he had returned home prompted by an alarm notification and recounted that he was rendered immobile upon arrival, enduring further assault by an intruder. He narrated that his wife had been shot and killed by this intruder upon her return from the gym. Subsequent digital inquiries were conducted, revealing a contradiction to Richard’s account. Data from Connie’s Fitbit, a wearable device capable of tracking GPS location, distance traveled, steps taken, and heart rate, disclosed that she was indeed at home during the time Richard alleged she was at the gym. The Fitbit data indicated that Connie ceased movement one minute before the home alarm was triggered. This instance underscores the potential of digital forensic methodologies, as they allow the collection and synthesis of evidence from diverse sources.
The continuous expansion of digital storage capacity, coupled with its ubiquitous integration into daily routines, leads to an increased need for such investigations. This, in turn, results in a higher volume of data requiring thorough examination [2]. As observed, conducting forensic inquiries on extensive data and systems can become both labor‐intensive and ineffective. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offer valuable assistance. AI endeavors to replicate human cognitive abilities, rendering it particularly advantageous due to its heightened efficiency when contrasted with the manual efforts of human operatives. It can be applied where it is dangerous for humans to enter and perform digital investigations. Machine learning which is a subset of AI can make it more efficient and reliable by applying mathematical algorithms to avoid manual programming which can be extremely inefficient. It helps in increasing the accuracy and reducing the possibility of an error to a great extent. Different techniques are applied to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the data so that applying machine learning algorithms will be easier and more accurate.


3.2 Literature Survey
Cihan et al. in Intelligence in Digital Forensics Process mention digital forensics corresponds to the modern counterpart of traditional criminal investigations, utilizing digital technologies to expedite the process [3]. In conventional forensics, an investigator’s expertise and prior experiences significantly influence the success and efficiency of the investigation. Likewise, harnessing computational resources and intelligence within contemporary contexts enhances the outcomes of digital investigations. This research builds upon existing literature by proposing the integration of machine learning algorithms, specifically those related to clustering and classification, applied to dynamic database files. The goal is to inject a level of intelligence into the digital investigation process. The study culminates in the creation of a comprehensive versatile framework for intelligent forensic investigations.
Forensic examination is commonly an intricate and time‐intensive procedure, demanding that forensic analysts gather and scrutinize diverse fragments of evidence to formulate a robust conclusion, Kelly et al. explained in Explainable AI for Digital Forensics: Opportunities, Challenges, and a Drug Testing Case Study [4]. In this chapter, a thorough examination is conducted into the potential opportunities and challenges linked to the advancement of interactive and comprehensible AI systems, recognized as explainable AI (XAI). These systems are designed to provide support to digital forensics by automating the decision‐making process. This automation, in turn, expedites the creation of credible evidence suitable for presentation in a court of law, ensuring both speed and reliability.
Jadhav et al. in its paper talked about AI involving endowing machines or computer programs with the capacity to emulate human‐like functions. These encompass a wide array of capabilities including visual comprehension, speech discernment, cognitive analysis, decision formulation, experiential assimilation, and the adept resolution of intricate problems. Notably, AI accomplishes these tasks with greater swiftness and a notably diminished error rate in contrast to human performance.
Dr. Mitchell suggests that the application of AI presents a valuable prospect. This field, deeply entrenched in contemporary computer science, excels in managing computationally intricate and expansive issues. Its potential utility in digital forensics is noteworthy, considering the escalating significance of this field [5]. Digital forensics frequently demands astute evaluation of extensive and intricate datasets. Herein lies the potential for AI to serve as a connecting link, effectively addressing these challenges.
Philip Turner’s work delves into the amalgamation of digital evidence derived from varying origins [2], as well as the adept utilization of digital evidence bags (DEBs) for targeted and judicious imaging [6]. The application of a forensic methodology to incident response, network analysis, and system administration, facilitated by the implementation of DEBs, is a subject of research [7]. The notion of DEBs is pivotal in this context, providing an encompassing container for diverse digital evidence origins. This approach ensures the preservation of origin information and the consistent thread of investigation across the entirety of its duration. The author advocates for the integration of intelligent methodologies in handling selective information capture scenarios, proposing the use of a selective image approach in conjunction with the DEB. The research delves into significant facets mirroring the effective amalgamation of expert insights from both technical and legal domains and ensuring the comprehensive capture of pertinent information and evidence relating to related crimes within the DEB.
