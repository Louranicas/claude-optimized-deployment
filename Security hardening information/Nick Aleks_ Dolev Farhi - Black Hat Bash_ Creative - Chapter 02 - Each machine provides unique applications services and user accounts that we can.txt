When you perform penetration tests from Kali, keep in mind that you may sometimes see Kali’s own IP addresses, 172.16.10.1 and 10.1.0.1, pop up in certain tool results. We won’t be testing those.



Managing the Lab
Now that you’ve set up your lab and taken a close look at its components, you’ll learn how to tear it down, start it, and rebuild it if needed.

Shutting Down
When you’re not using the lab environment, turning it off is good practice. To shut down all the containers running in the lab, run the following:
$ sudo make teardown
You should receive a list of all stopped containers, as well as the removed networks and volumes, as shown here:
==== Shutdown Started ====
Stopping p-web-02     ... done
Stopping c-jumpbox-01 ... done
--snip--
Removing volume lab_p_web_02_vol
OK: lab has shut down.

To restart your containers, simply rerun the deploy command mentioned in “Deploying Docker Containers” on page
