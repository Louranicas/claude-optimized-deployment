# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Gregory C. Rasner - Cybersecurity and Third-Party Risk_ Third Party Threat Hunting (2021, Wiley) - libgen.li
Chapter: 2 - begins with Chapter  10, which discusses the 
large topic of the cloud. The shared responsibility model is dis-
cussed and how it affects the security controls that your vendor 
is responsible for and what they have outsourced to the Cloud 
Service Provider (CSP). Cybersecurity, offshore vendors, cloud 
and privacy legal language and process is covered in Chapter 11; 
and then Chapter 12 details in depth the possible ways to test and 
perform due diligence on third-party software. Connectivity to a 
vendor is a unique risk that opens a whole organization’s network 
and data to an attacker traversing from the vendor or exploiting 
the hardware they use to connect, and is discussed in Chapter 13. 
Chapter 14 contains details on how to manage offshore vendor

risk, while Chapter 15 wraps up with ways to take all the data 
collected with the due diligence and other cybersecurity activi-
ties to become more predictive for risks and produce reports.
Special Features
The notes found sprinkled throughout this book are designed to 
provide an example or expansion on topics that bring the topic 
(either in the chapter or the book as a whole) into a real-world 
illustration or in-depth analysis. Tips are added in the book to 
deliver information to the reader on how to improve a process or 
activity (or a common pitfall to avoid), while definitions help the 
reader to understand the concepts involved.

What Is the Risk? 3
On December 10, 2020, ESET researchers announce they have 
found that a chat software called Able Desktop (Able)—part 
of a widely used business management suite in Mongolia including 
430  Mongolian government agencies—was exploited to deliver 
the HyperBro backdoor, the Korplug RAT (remote access trojan), 
and another RAT named Tmanger. They also found and identified 
a connection with the ShadowPad backdoor, used by at least five 
threat actors in the exploit. T wo installers were infected with the 
trojan and the compromised Able update system was installed with 
the malicious software. Evidence shows that the Able system had 
been compromised since June 2020, while the malware-infected 
installers were delivered as far back as May
