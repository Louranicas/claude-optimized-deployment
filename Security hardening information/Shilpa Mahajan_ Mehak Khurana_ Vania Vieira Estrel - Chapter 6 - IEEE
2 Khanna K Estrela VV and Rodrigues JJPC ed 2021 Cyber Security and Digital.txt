13.1 Introduction
A comprehensive cybersecurity (CS) framework must help implement “cyber‐physical systems” (CPSs) effectively while managing potential security risks to accommodate the Internet of Things (IoT) hardware (HW) diversity [1–3]. Both factors are becoming increasingly crucial in infrastructure, administration, and daily existence. Under this context, every system incorporates advanced networked structures with computing devices, embedded controllers, sensors, and actuators [4, 5]. These systems’ components enable gathering and interacting with the physical world’s data while designed for real‐time operations and warrant reliable performance, particularly in applications that involve essential safety considerations. The IoT experiences ongoing growth and development due to falling costs and the convergence of sensors, actuators, platforms, controllers, networks, etc. The latest IoT innovation comprises significant assets in the ongoing innovation‐driven economy with substantial and inexpensive advantages and presents extensive development and growth forecasts. Simultaneously, integrating CPS and IoT amplifies the vulnerabilities and potential targets for CAs. The “attack surface” (AS) refers to the comprehensive set of possible entry points, commonly known as attack vectors, by which an unauthorized user might enter a system and retrieve data [5]. The easiness of protecting a system tends to be inversely proportional to the surface of attack size.
The unpremeditated faults or malicious CAs could severely impact humans and the planet’s natural environment. Hands‐on and coordinated efforts are paramount to designing, deploying, and strengthening CPS and IoT’s dependability and security [4, 5]. Progresses in networking, computing, detecting, and control systems have aided a multitude of new devices, albeit security is often absent and left for later. Functional prerequisites and fast‐moving markets drive the industry. Design paradigms evolve continuously and speedily, whereas standards undergo debates. Many devices whose design lifespans are quantified in decades undergo deployment. Project choices will impact transportation, healthcare, building automation, emergency response, energy production, and other sectors. Modern means of transport can automatically stop to avoid accidents. Healthcare apparatuses can observe conditions in real‐time adaptations to changes. Several innovative services can boost the energy grid and intelligent buildings. If CS is overlooked, one risks unintentional faults or malevolent CAs altering the ways vehicles stop, health devices self‐adjust, and buildings/smart grids respond to events. CS becomes more puzzling as the number of gadgets with security vulnerabilities escalates. Addressing CS by enforcing models/designs onto extensively deployed systems is unrealistic. Security concerns must be analyzed, assimilated, and managed promptly in the project and deployment phases.
CPSs and IoT interact with cyberspace across numerous sectors. To ensure realistic CS building blocks for particular systems, employing a layered scheme, CPSs must be robust to CS difficulties (e.g., safety, financial side, trustworthiness, interoperability, “social engineering,” [SE] and privacy).
CA’s success and mission impacts depend on several aspects in complex dynamic contexts. Besides introducing or eliminating machines, programs might change network conditions, which poses a major challenge. The information gap between cyberspace’s offensive and defensive sides grows. When faced with a continually updated exposure or attack pattern, defenders typically fail to understand the latest attacking strategies, vulnerability information, and appropriate defense plans to confront the attacker. The endurance and concealment of new attack features like “advanced persistent threat” (APT) CAs [6] limit standard security technologies centered around “machine learning” (ML), metaheuristics, and deep learning (DL) as in Figure 13.1 [7–9]. Simple tasks like feature extraction [10], anomaly detection [11, 12], and data classification [12] cannot reconstruct a full CA behavior depiction. Expert knowledge buried in CS data is still essential to solve the above difficulties.

Nevertheless, CS‐related data underwent widespread growth. These diverse, heterogeneous, and fragmented data make it difficult for CS managers to quickly discover vital information. Therefore, the current CS problem is not obtainable data shortage but how to assemble multiple sources’ heterogeneous information into one model to better comprehend CS with supplementary decision assistance. The current CS analysis focuses on obtaining correlations and potential CAs from CTI data. Technologies viz. correlation analysis [13], causal inference [14], and semantic reasoning [15] that rely on knowledge modeling helped create new strategies under “big data” (BD) conditions.
The “CS knowledge graph” (CSKG) is a security‐specific “knowledge graph” (KG) with nodes and edges that form a large‐scale CS semantic network and provide an intelligible modeling structure for numerous CAs and defense setups in the real world. Nodes signify entities or abstract rationales (e.g., weakness designation, CA pattern, product name, business, etc.), and edges denote entities’ attributes or relationships. Nodes and edges form a KG whose advantages can be threefold:

KG creation and refinement, ontology [16], “information extraction” (IE) [17], and entity disambiguation [18] help disclose and blend multisource diverse data‐driven knowledge.
CS knowledge can be expressed structurally and relationally, and graphically visualizing knowledge is intuitive and efficient.
Semantic modeling, query practices, and inferring technologies can imitate security specialists’ thinking processes to get new understanding (aka new relations) or examine data consistency using logic procedures and existent details (i.e., triples, quadruples, etc.) [19].

While several CSKGs apply different CS views, most have focused on KG development. It remains unclear in what way KGs solve real burdens in CA and defense scenarios. Many organizations’ CS managers speculate if existing CSKGs can be reused and how they match their “information and communication technology” (ICT) infrastructure. Furthermore, it is worth contemplating what fresh facts a team requires for new relationship inferences. KG design evaluation needs “cyber‐situational awareness” (CSA), safety analysis, security assessment, and association studies, restricting the hyperspace security assessment region and temporal and spatial dimensions. The chronological aspect entails the prevention, recognition, or reaction security phases. Spatially, it offers a probability to incorporate various operational modules (i.e., CTs, network infrastructure, security outlook, task dependencies, and so on) into a cohesive “knowledge base” (KB) for many CS undertakings. Other CSKG characteristics, including ontology, construction tools, data sources, and reasoning procedures [20–22], address their usability effort to solve hands‐on problems. The main contributions in this chapter are

Comprehensive CSKG setting analysis, i.e., a CSKG scenario categorization framework, requires background and creation technology research.
Relevant datasets are curated datasets’ analyses and open‐source (OO) libraries facilitate future CSKG construction and IE tasks.
Future directions summarize each category and highlight promising trends.

This chapter’s next Section introduces the basics of KGs in CS.
