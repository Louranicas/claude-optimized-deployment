After a recent cybersecurity breach shook both U.S. govern-
ment agencies and corporations and was proclaimed the 
worst ever, many colleagues asked me if this was my “I told you 
so” moment. While I could have gloated a bit, I instead reminded 
them and anyone else who would listen that the next one is right 
around the corner if third-party risk is not front and center in the 
security discussion.
As an executive at Cisco and Microsoft, I have built new 
organizations delivering trust, transparency, cybersecurity, 
compliance, risk management, sustainability and value-chain 
transformation. I have been invited to provide testimony to 
U.S. Presidential Commissions on cybersecurity and currently 
serve on the executive committee of the Department of Home-
land Security’s Information and Communications T echnol-
ogy Supply Chain Risk Management T ask Force. In addition,  
I have authored NATO directives and contributed my input to 
numerous government and industry bodies. In all cases, third-
party risk is my primary concern and focus.
There are no easy answers when it comes to third-party 
security and risk. We all operate in a hyper- connected world and 
third-party ecosystems continue to expand. When one considers Foreword
Foreword xvii
IT/OT convergence, the proliferation of IoT/IIoT, expanding 
global supply chains, and the accelerated move to a platform 
economy, it is obvious that the threat surface for both private 
and public sector organizations continues to grow. So how do we 
as security and risk professionals tackle this mounting challenge?
Greg’s book, Cybersecurity and Third-Party Risk, is both 
timely and necessary. As colleagues at Cisco, Greg and I pondered 
and identified solutions to the very issues he raises throughout 
this book. Readers can leverage his clear risk identification and  
practical guidance to build sustainable and effective third-party 
risk programs. As the book points out, third-party risk is noth-
ing new and is not going away. But let’s be clear: The message is 
not one of fear, and the book clearly establishes what we can and 
must continue to do to meaningfully address this critical risk.
Cybersecurity and Third-Party Risk should be added to the 
bookshelves of all security and risk professionals, regardless 
of the industry in which they operate. It will serve as a guide 
to developing a foundational third-party security program as 
you address the growing third-party risk at your organization.  
Consider yourself fortunate to have access to both Greg’s exper -
tise and his thoughtful and comprehensive approach to a chal-
lenge we must all consider a priority.

Third-party risk (or supply-chain security) are not new 
 disciplines, and there have been frameworks, regulatory 
directives, professional certifications, and organizations that all 
attest to its maturity. Cybersecurity could be considered more 
mature, since it has been around in some form since computing 
came of age in the 1970s. Nowadays, it’s even more complex in 
terms of frameworks, disciplines, certifications, regulatory guid-
ance and directives, and avenues of study. Why do the surveys, 
time after time, indicate that well over 50 percent of organiza-
tions do not perform any type of Third-Party Risk Management 
(TPRM), and even fewer have anything other than an ad hoc 
cybersecurity due diligence program for vendors? Reasons for 
this lack of attention and collaboration can be found in hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of breaches and security incidents that 
were the result of poor third-party oversight and a lack of any 
due diligence and due care for the vendors’ cybersecurity.
This book is designed to provide a detailed look into the 
problems and risks, then give specific examples of how to create a 
robust and active Cybersecurity Third-Party Risk Management 
program. It begins by covering the basics of the due diligence 
processes and the vendor lifecycle, with models and illustrations 
on how to create these basic but necessary steps. Then it goes 
more in depth about the next parts in the creation of a mature Introduction

program: cyber legal language, offshore vendors, connectiv-
ity security, software security, and use of a predictive reporting 
dashboard.
The book is designed to not only help you build a program, 
but to take an existing program from one of compliance checkbox 
work to an active threat-hunting practice. Many programs that do 
currently exist are designed and run as an obligation to “check a 
box” for a regulator or an internal auditor. Yet, no one has ever 
secured their network or data by doing only what the regulators 
told them to do. Security is an ongoing activity that requires its 
application in third-party risk to be equally active and ongoing. Its 
activities and results should emulate a cyber operations or threat 
operations team that focuses its efforts on reducing cybersecu-
rity threats externally at the suppliers. Get away from checking 
boxes and filling out remote questionnaires and take a risk-based 
approach that engages your highest risk and/or most critical third 
parties in conversations to build trust and collaboration to lower 
risk for both your organization and the vendor.
Who Will Benefit Most from This Book
A superset of cybersecurity, third-party risk, and executive lead-
ership will benefit the most from reading this book. On the 
cybersecurity side, analysts to senior leadership will be able to 
take their information security knowledge and experience to 
perform the hands-on work and management of third-party 
risk, while third-party risk professionals will better understand 
and appreciate the need to include a more robust cybersecurity 
risk domain. Executive and senior leadership in business who 
are not focused on cybersecurity or third-party risk will gain an 
understanding of the risk, practice, and frameworks, and how to 
lower their risk for a cybersecurity event at their vendors.

Looking Ahead in This Book
This book is divided into two sections. Section  1, titled “The 
Basics,” lays the case for the need of a robust and active Cyber -
security Third-Party Risk Management program as well as the 
 necessary and basic due diligence activities and processes needed. 
These are not basic as in “simple,” but in terms that they are 
the foundation necessary to building a mature program, which 
is covered in Section 2, titled “Next Steps.” This section details 
what comes next, after you have built the basic foundation. This 
“Next Steps” section describes cyber legal language, cloud secu-
rity, software security, connectivity security, offshore vendors, 
and how to build predictive reporting that focuses on the highest 
risk vendors.
Chapter 1 opens with a detailed description of risk by using 
examples of the SolarWinds and other supply-chain attacks, 
which happened in late 2020, as prime examples of how the threat 
actors have evolved both in their identity and tactics. Examples 
are also provided in a long list of companies who have lost their 
data due to a vendor that did not take due care with their data. 
Chapter  2 provides some basics on cybersecurity. This book 
does not require the reader to be a cybersecurity or third-party 
risk expert, but it does require that a few concepts are defined 
and frameworks are covered for both topics to ensure all read-
ers are at a set level. Chapter 3 delves into how the COVID-19 
pandemic affected the security landscape and how quickly the 
attackers adapted to new opportunities. What happens when the 
pandemic is over and how it will change behaviors and business 
in ways that will become the new normal will mean a continued 
increase in cybercriminal activity.
Chapter  4 is an in-depth look at Third-Party Risk Man-
agement (TPRM) and is included to provide a set level for the 
readers as well as to tie the cybersecurity and TPRM concepts

together, as both domains are aimed at identifying and man-
aging risk. Chapters 5 through 9 cover the vendor lifecycle of 
intake, ongoing security, and offboarding due diligence activities 
 Chapter 5 reviews the activities and requirements for vetting and 
performing security assessments of new vendors or services from 
existing suppliers. Chapter  6 describes ongoing cybersecurity 
due diligence activities such as remote assessments.  Chapter 7 is 
then devoted to the important complex topic of on-site assess-
ments, which are essential due diligence processes for the physi-
cal validation of security controls at a vendor site and the gold 
standard for assurance.
Chapter  8 covers the Continuous Monitoring (CM) pro-
gram and how it is a crucial security control for vendors for 
the times in between the point-in-time assessments. Building 
a robust CM program means taking a set of tools and internal 
data to engage vendors on potential real threats that they may 
be unaware of and reducing risk collaboratively. Chapter 9, the 
last chapter on the vendor lifecycle, discusses offboarding. Many 
firms overlook this part of the lifecycle, so this chapter covers 
the critical steps and due diligence that must be done to ensure 
there’s no risk to the data or connectivity from a vendor.
