Chapter: 4 - For example, it is relatively simple to manipulate a woman's image to create pornographic material. Some of the crimes committed against women are discussed as follows.
Cyberstalking
Cyberstalking involves tracking and harassing an individual through online channels. The offender systematically gathers information about the woman to issue threats through various means, resulting in significant mental anguish and suffering for the victim. The anonymity provided by the Internet empowers stalkers, who could be located anywhere across the globe to nearby neighbors or even close relatives. Cyberstalking entails monitoring a person's online activities, which may include posting messages, sometimes threatening, on forums frequented by the victim, joining chat rooms the victim visits, and continuously sending emails to the victim. Generally, the stalker aims to inflict emotional distress without any valid justification for their communications.
Voyeurism
The growing miniaturization of digital technology, along with the widespread availability of recording devices and the ease of reproducing and sharing digital images, has contributed to a noticeable rise in behavior commonly termed as voyeurism. This often entails individuals covertly observing, and sometimes recording, others in settings typically considered private. Advancements in video production and image capture technologies have made voyeuristic behavior increasingly common and accessible. Voyeurism disregards an individual's reasonable expectations of privacy, constituting a criminal offense against both their privacy and dignity. It undermines a person's autonomy by disregarding their consent or awareness in exposing their body or engaging in sexual acts. This can occur through unwarranted observation or the distribution of images or videos without the victim's consent or knowledge. Additionally, the emergence of revenge porn involves sharing private or intimate images with the intent to disgrace and humiliate the individual, whether obtained through voyeurism or consent.
Section 66E of the IT Act, 2000, addresses the offense of violation of privacy by capturing or disseminating images of a person engaged in a private act without their consent. This provision aims to safeguard individuals from unauthorized intrusion into their personal space and activities. It prohibits the unauthorized recording or distribution of private moments, protecting the dignity and privacy of individuals. Offenders under Section 66E may face legal consequences, including imprisonment and fines, for breaching the privacy rights of others through digital means.
Doxing
Doxing is derived from dropping documents and involves the malicious publication of an individual's personal and confidential information on the Internet. This action deprives individuals of their online anonymity, exposing them to numerous risks in both virtual and real-life scenarios. The main aim is to intimidate, harm, or exploit the individual whose private information has been exposed.
Initially, the term doxing was used to expose hidden online identities. However, its scope has expanded beyond the hacker community, impacting individuals who use their real names online, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
Motivations for doxing vary widely. Some individuals engage in this practice out of anger towards someone, while others do so in response to disagreement with someone's opinions. Still, others use doxing as a means to reveal perceived hidden information, particularly during heated debates. The information shared during doxing can range from innocuous data to potentially harmful or hazardous details.
The consequence of doxing can range from minor nuisances like receiving unwanted pizza deliveries to more severe issues such as cyberbullying or real-life harassment. Notably, prominent figures such as celebrities, politicians, or high-ranking executives have been victims of such attacks, jeopardizing their safety and overall well-being. Regardless of the motive behind it, doxing constitutes a significant invasion of privacy and can lead to grave consequences for the individuals targeted.
Protecting yourself from doxing necessitates a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity and privacy. Firstly, prioritize digital security by consistently utilizing a virtual private network (VPN) and implementing MFA to strengthen the defenses. Strengthening passwords and usernames by opting for complex combinations and refraining from using identical ones across various platforms is imperative. Additionally, exercise caution with emails and communications, establishing separate email accounts for different purposes and remaining vigilant against suspicious or phishing attempts. Regularly monitoring your digital footprint and setting up Google alerts for your name can help mitigate potential risks. Masking domain ownership details through domain privacy services and adjusting privacy settings on social media platforms to limit public visibility of personal information are essential steps. Furthermore, safeguarding financial accounts and refraining from disclosing sensitive details are crucial measures for enhanced protection. Taking control of the information you share online, including requesting removal of personal data from search engines and being mindful of divulging specifics that could be exploited maliciously, is vital for mitigating the threat of doxing.
Cyber grooming
Creating an online friendship with a child with the intention of cultivating a relationship that may result in sexual abuse, exploitation, or human trafficking is known as cyber grooming. The primary objectives of cyber grooming include gaining the child's trust, soliciting intimate and personal information—often of a sexual nature—such as engaging in sexual conversations, sharing explicit images or videos, and subsequently using this material for manipulation, coercion, or blackmail.
Cyber criminals frequently assume false identities of children or teenagers and approach their targets through child-friendly websites, exploiting the innocence of youngsters who may be unaware of the predatory intent behind such interactions. Initial conversations often appear harmless, focusing on general topics like age, hobbies, school, and family, before progressing to more personal and sexual inquiries. Groomers employ various strategies for persuasion to coax victims into sharing explicit materials. Children or teens can unintentionally initiate the grooming process themselves by engaging with websites or forums that offer enticing incentives, such as money, in exchange for contact details or intimate photos. The anonymity and widespread accessibility of digital technology enable groomers to simultaneously target multiple children, exacerbating the prevalence of cyber grooming cases. Some of the cybercrimes committed against women is illustrated in Figure 3.4:

Indian laws regulating cybercrimes against women
Several Indian statutes regulate cybercrimes, often with significant overlap between them. Among these, three legislations specifically target cybercrimes against women.:

The Indian Penal Code, 1860: It provides legal recourse and protection for women against various offenses, including those related to gender-based violence and discrimination. It encompasses provisions specifically addressing crimes such as sexual harassment, assault, and trafficking, ensuring the safeguarding of women's rights and dignity.
