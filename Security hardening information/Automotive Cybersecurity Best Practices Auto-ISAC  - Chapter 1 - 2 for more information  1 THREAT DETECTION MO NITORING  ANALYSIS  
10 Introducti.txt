2. Collaboration and Engagement with Appropriate Third Parties  
3. Governance  
4. Risk Assessment and Management  
5. Awareness and Training  
6. Threat Detection, Monitoring and Analysis  
7. Security Development Lifecycle  
Guides offer greater detail to complement the high -level Executive Summary. This G uide aligns 
with the “Threat Detection , Monitoring and Analysis ” function and is made available for use by 
companies, as  appropriate for their unique systems, processes, and risks.  
1.2 PURPOS E 
The purpose of this Guide is to assist  automotive  industry stakeholders with identifying, 
monitoring , and analyzing vehicle cybersecurity  threats .  
This Guide provides forward -looking  guidance without being prescriptive or restrictive. The se best 
practices are:  
• Not Required . Organizations have the autonomy and ability to select and voluntarily adopt 
practices based on their respective risk landscapes and organizational structures.

as appropriate.  
• Living . Auto-ISAC plans to periodically update this Guide to adapt to the evolving 
automotive cybersecurity  landscape.   
1.3 SCOPE  
This Guide describes key considerations for companies around  vehicle cybersecurity  threat  
management efforts . It contains best practi ces and implementation guidance for companies to 
identify, monitor , and analyze  vehicle cybersecurity threats .   
Vehicle cybersecurity threat s exist or emerge in all phases of the vehicle lifecycle,  including 
design, development,  and post -production . These  phases are described in F igure 1 below.

FIGURE 1: VEHICLE LIFECYCLE PHASES  
Given the difference s in these phases , it might be helpful for organization s to identify applicable 
factors that will aid in the identification and efficient monitoring of threats . Additionally, due to 
differences in each phase , threat detection approaches and analys es can differ across the vehicle 
lifecycle phases.  
1.4 AUDIENCE   
This Guide was written for use by light -duty and heavy -duty vehicle OEMs, light -duty and heavy -
duty vehicle suppliers, and commercial vehicle companies ( e.g. fleets, carriers). It may also 
provide insights for other stakeholders across the connected vehicle ecosystem.  
Within these organizations,  for the primary audience is  vehicle cybersecurity mana gers, leaders, 
and senior executives  responsible for identifying cyber threats .
