Chapter: 33 - From the information available, I assume the attackers gained access to Piriform’s development environment through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in their build system. Once inside, the attackers injected malware directly into the software update that would later be distributed to millions of users.
The malicious update contained a multistage payload. The first stage collected basic system information from infected devices, such as Internet Protocol addresses, installed software, and system configurations. This data was then sent to the attackers’ command-and-control servers, where they could evaluate which systems were worth targeting for further exploitation. The second stage involved a more selective attack on high-value targets, allowing the attackers to deploy additional malware on devices belonging to major technology and telecommunications companies.
The attack timeline reveals that the compromised version of CCleaner was distributed between August and September 2017, during which time over 2.27 million users downloaded the infected software. The attackers’ methods were highly sophisticated and precisely operated to infiltrate the development environment and the end-user systems. Their ability to remain undetected during the attack underscores organizations’ challenges in securing their software supply chains.
Detection and Response Efforts
The CCleaner supply chain attack was detected in mid-September 2017 when Cisco Talos and Avast security researchers identified unusual network activity and communications originating from CCleaner installations. Once the breach was identified, Piriform, Avast, and other cybersecurity firms worked quickly to analyze the scope of the attack, determine how the malware had been inserted into the software, and develop a remediation plan to protect affected users.
Piriform immediately responded by pulling the compromised version of CCleaner from its distribution channels and releasing a clean update (version 5.34) for users. From what I have reviewed, Avast and other cybersecurity experts conducted forensic analyses to understand the full extent of the attack and assess whether any additional malware had been deployed on high-value targets. The quick response likely prevented the attackers from fully exploiting their access to sensitive systems.
The response timeline highlights the importance of collaboration between security researchers, software vendors, and law enforcement agencies. Although the attack was detected within a month of onset, the damage could have been far more severe if it had gone unnoticed for longer. Piriform and Avast’s transparency in acknowledging the breach and releasing updates to mitigate the threat helped reassure users and limit further damage.
Assessing the Impact
The immediate impact of the CCleaner attack was significant, affecting millions of users who had downloaded the compromised version of the software.

The attack exposed the weaknesses in ASUS’s development environment, spotlighting the security of automatic software update mechanisms across the tech industry.
Unfolding the Attack
The ASUS Live Update Utility attack unfolded in 2018 when a group of attackers, believed to be state-sponsored, gained access to ASUS’s software development environment. From the available information, I assume the attackers inserted a malicious backdoor into the Live Update utility by compromising the software’s build pipeline. They signed the malicious updates with ASUS’s legitimate digital certificates, allowing the tainted software to bypass security checks and appear as legitimate updates to users.
The malicious updates were delivered to nearly 500,000 ASUS users, but the attackers targeted a smaller group of high-value individuals using a predefined list of MAC addresses. These MAC addresses allowed the malware to activate selectively, ensuring that only specific devices were compromised while most infected systems remained inactive. This targeted approach indicated that the attackers knew their intended victims well.
From what I understand, the attackers used advanced techniques such as code signing and sophisticated malware payloads to remain undetected for an extended period. The attack timeline suggests that the initial compromise occurred months before the malware was discovered. The attackers were able to infiltrate ASUS’s systems, insert the backdoor, and distribute the compromised updates while avoiding detection from security systems and antivirus software.
Detection and Response Efforts
The ASUS attack was first detected in early 2019 by Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity firm monitoring suspicious activity within its user base. Kaspersky researchers identified anomalous behavior linked to the ASUS Live Update utility and discovered compromised software. Their investigation revealed that malicious updates had been distributed for several months before the breach was uncovered.
Upon discovering the attack, Kaspersky contacted ASUS and other cybersecurity firms, including Symantec, to assist in the investigation and contain the damage. ASUS initially denied the breach but later acknowledged the issue after further evidence came to light. The company issued a clean update to replace the compromised version of Live Update. It provided a diagnostic tool to help users determine if their devices had been affected by the malware.
The response timeline shows that while ASUS’s initial reaction was slow, the involvement of third-party cybersecurity researchers played a crucial role in detecting the breach and mitigating the attack. ASUS’s collaboration with cybersecurity firms helped contain the spread of the malware and provided users with tools to check for infection. However, the delay in acknowledging the breach and the initial lack of transparency from ASUS raised concerns about the company’s incident response capabilities.
Assessing the Impact
The immediate impact of the ASUS Live Update Utility attack was significant, as nearly half a million users unknowingly received malicious software updates. However, the number of compromised systems was far lower since the attackers used a targeted approach, focusing on high-value individuals. The attack did not appear to cause widespread operational disruption, but it raised serious concerns about the potential for future exploitation, data theft, and espionage.
Financially, ASUS faced considerable costs related to incident response, security investigations, and reputational damage. The company’s delay in addressing the breach and lack of initial transparency likely contributed to the loss of trust among customers and industry partners. While no large-scale financial losses were reported, the reputational damage was perhaps the most significant consequence because ASUS’s ability to secure its software development environment was questioned.
The broader industry implications of the ASUS attack were profound. The incident highlighted the vulnerabilities in automatic update mechanisms, even for well-established hardware manufacturers. It prompted other organizations to reevaluate their software supply chains and the security of their development environments.
