1.3 Understanding Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) 
in Cybersecurity 
Due to the exponential development in threat propagation caused by the daily 
release of new malware, it is practically impossible to adequately deal with today’s 
numerous cyber threats using solely human analysis. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is
1.3 Understanding Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity 9
transforming the cybersecurity industry by making it simpler and more intelligent 
to identify, prevent, and respond to online threats, in which we are interested 
throughout this book. In the following, we discuss the key potentialities of AI as 
well as their diverse categories, within the context of cybersecurity. 
1.3.1 Potentiality of AI 
The knowledge of AI is revolutionizing the cybersecurity industry around the world. 
Due to its computational capability for intelligent decision-making and automation 
in a speciﬁc problem domain, it is taken into account as the key to the development 
of intelligent services [ 5]. Traditional security solutions such as antivirus, ﬁrewalls, 
user authentication, encryption, and other well-known security solutions might not 
be sufﬁcient to meet today’s diverse needs [ 2]. As mentioned earlier, the main issue 
with traditional systems is that they are typically maintained by a small number of 
knowledgeable security professionals, and the data processing is done on an ad-
hoc basis, limiting them from responding intelligently and automatically to today’s 
needs [ 2, 11]. Thus, the capabilities and characteristics of AI-driven cybersecurity 
are deﬁned by its major three aspects “automation,” “intelligence,” and “robustness” 
as below: 
• Automation in cybersecurity: The ability of AI-driven cybersecurity systems 
to automate tasks and processes without human intervention is referred to as 
automation. The use of algorithms, scripts, and machine learning models simpli-
ﬁes repetitive and time-consuming activities, including threat detection, incident 
response, and routine security operations. Using automation, the system can 
respond quickly to security events and carry out predeﬁned actions to enhance 
operational efﬁciency. It streamlines security operations, speeds up response 
times, and reduces cybersecurity staff workload. Thus this helps organizations 
deal with large volumes of data and security alerts by reducing the response time 
to potentially dangerous threats. 
• Intelligence in cybersecurity: An intelligent system is one that is capable of 
analyzing data, understanding context, and making informed decisions based on 
complex patterns and insights. Intelligent cybersecurity solutions can identify 
and respond to novel and sophisticated threats by observing patterns, anomalies, 
or behaviors that aren’t explicitly programmed. Intelligent cybersecurity systems 
often involve advanced analytics, machine learning algorithms, and threat intel-
ligence that can adapt and learn from new data to improve their performance 
over time. This adaptability and the capability to provide actionable insights are 
crucial for staying ahead of evolving cyber threats. 
• Robustness in cybersecurity: A robust AI-driven cybersecurity system maintains 
its effectiveness under a variety of conditions and resists degradation or failure, 
including attempts by adversaries to manipulate or exploit it. It involves design-
ing AI models and algorithms that generalize well to different situations and
10 1 Introduction to AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence
remain effective over time. Thus, a robust cybersecurity system can handle and 
withstand adversarial attacks, data noise or poisoning, and threats that change 
over time. It is resilient and provides reliable and accurate security results, even when unexpected circumstances arise or deliberate attempts are made to deceive 
the system. 
In summary, automation focuses on executing tasks without human intervention, 
intelligence involves understanding and adapting to complex data patterns, and robustness ensures the system’s resilience and effectiveness in the face of various challenges. AI-driven cybersecurity solutions often combine these components into 
a powerful defense mechanism against a wide variety of cyber threats. 
1.3.2 Categories of AI 
AI models can be categorized into three major types such as generative, discrim-
inative, and hybrid AI models. In the context of cybersecurity, each model serves 
distinct roles and may have different applications as discussed below: 
• Generative AI: Generative models are versatile and designed to generate new, previously unseen data samples, often in the form of images, text, or other types of media. Generative models can enhance the effectiveness of machine 
learning models by adding synthetic data to datasets and supplying more diverse training data. They concentrate on simulating the data’s underlying probability distribution and are thus helpful for producing synthetic training and test datasets. 
For example, generative AI can be used to produce mobile malware samples for creating defensive models. To assess the efﬁcacy of security measures, security researchers can use a variety of malware types through the power of generative 
AI. 
• Discriminative AI: Discriminative AI concentrates on distinguishing between distinct classes or categories within the data. Due to their superior classiﬁ-
cation performance and capacity to distinguish between various data classes, discriminative models are frequently utilized in cybersecurity. For instance, discriminative models can recognize malware by identifying patterns and char-
acteristics linked to malicious code or behaviors. These models are frequently employed in intrusion detection systems, particularly to categorize network data or user behavior as malicious or benign. Based on incoming data, they are used 
to make decisions that are binary or multi-class. 
• Hybrid AI: To capitalize on the advantages of each strategy, hybrid AI integrates both generating and discriminative elements, mentioned above. It aims to offer 
an enhanced and adaptable solution. To identify adversarial attacks, hybrid AI models can make use of generative components to generate artiﬁcial attack samples that can be used to train discriminative models. Thus, by addressing 
both generative and discriminative parts of cybersecurity, hybrid AI models can provide a more multifaceted solution. They are adaptable and able to respond to many different security concerns.
1.3 Understanding Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity 11
In summary, the particular use case and requirements determine whether to 
utilize generative, discriminative, or hybrid AI in cybersecurity. To tackle chal-
lenging tasks like anomaly detection and adversarial defense, hybrid AI combines 
the optimal aspects of generative and discriminative AI. Particularly, generative AI 
is useful for producing synthetic data and malware variants according to needs. 
Organizations can use these techniques to provide cybersecurity solutions that are 
efﬁcient and adaptable to the threat landscape. In addition, AI can be categorized in 
several other ways by taking into account the nature of computing and data types 
[2]. In the following, we discuss these with their potential use cases: 
• Analytical AI —This is usually focused on the ability to extract insights or pat-
terns from data to provide suggestions, assisting in data-driven decision-making. 
Analytical AI analyses vast amounts of data, including network trafﬁc, logs, user 
activity, and historical attack trends, to detect anomalies and potential threats. 
It can be used in conjunction with intrusion detection systems (IDS), security 
information and event management (SIEM) tools, and predictive analytics to 
identify and respond to cyber threats in real time. Predicting threats, detecting 
anomalies, ﬁnding zero-day vulnerabilities, and improving incident response 
through data-driven insights are some potential use cases of analytical AI in the 
context of cybersecurity. 
• Functional AI —This is comparable to analytical AI in that it executes an action 
based on extracted insights or knowledge instead of offering suggestions. It 
specializes in carrying out predetermined tasks or workﬂows free of human 
involvement. In general, functional AI can be seen doing specialized tasks like 
navigation, object recognition, or industrial automation in a variety of automated 
tasks. Speciﬁc security tasks, such as automated vulnerability assessment, patch 
management, and network segmentation for isolating compromised computers, 
can be carried out autonomously by functional AI. To speed up human inter-
vention and response times, it can automate regular security tasks including 
vulnerability assessment, compliance checks, and security policy enforcement. 
• Interactive AI —Interactive AI systems are designed to interact with humans in a 
way that seems natural to them, such as through speech, gestures, or text. They 
promote interaction and two-way communication. Interactive AI can facilitate 
human-computer engagement in cybersecurity. For instance, virtual assistants 
can aid security analysts, answer inquiries about security, and provide guidance 
during incident response. Chatbots for incident reporting, virtual assistants for 
security policy queries, interactive dashboards for security monitoring, etc. are 
some use cases of interactive AI in the context of cybersecurity. 
• Textual AI —Understanding and creating text in the form of human language is 
the focus of textual AI. It uses natural language processing (NLP) methods to 
analyze and create text. To gain insights and identify potential threats, textual 
AI can analyze and comprehend the textual data included in security papers, 
reports, and communications. NLP including the popular large language model 
(LLM) is the engine that drives textual AI. Large amounts of text data are 
often needed for LLM training to produce text that is coherent and contextually
12 1 Introduction to AI-Driven Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence
appropriate. Thus textual AI can help with threat intelligence analysis, threat 
hunting, and identifying potential vulnerabilities referenced in text sources. 
Sentiment analysis for social media threat monitoring, automated security report 
analysis, email content analysis for phishing detection, etc. are some use cases of 
textual AI in the context of cybersecurity. 
• Visual AI —The main goal of visual AI is to interpret and comprehend visual 
content, such as images and videos. To evaluate and extract information from 
visual input, it uses computer vision algorithms. Visual AI can analyze images, 
videos, and other visual data to identify security vulnerabilities. It is mostly 
based on computer vision techniques. It can be used for object detection, 
facial recognition, and surveillance. Some use cases include detecting intrusion 
utilizing security camera feeds, facial recognition for access management, and 
identifying unauthorized physical access to secure areas. 
• Hybrid AI —Hybrid AI combines elements from multiple AI approaches to 
utilize their beneﬁts and address difﬁcult problems. It may use machine learning, 
rule-based systems, and other AI techniques to handle various aspects of 
cybersecurity. To provide a comprehensive cybersecurity solution, hybrid AI 
combines elements from several AI approaches, which makes it a powerful 
tool. Hybrid AI can be used in challenging cybersecurity scenarios including 
enhanced threat detection, incident response, security orchestration, and so on, 
where several AI modalities work together to improve overall security posture. 
In practice, cybersecurity usually involves a wide variety of AI types to properly 
address a range of threats and weaknesses. For instance, analytical AI can identify 
network anomalies, functional AI can automatically prevent known threats, interac-
tive AI can alert security analysts in real time, textual AI can review threat reports, 
visual AI can monitor physical security, and hybrid AI can coordinate and optimize 
all of these various elements for a comprehensive defense strategy. By combining 
several AI modalities inside a hybrid AI framework, organizations can adapt to 
evolving cyber threats and maintain a strong security posture across all of their 
digital assets. 
1.3.3 Relationship with Prominent T echnologies 
In the real world, each type of AI can address different sets of challenges according 
to their computing capabilities. In most cases, popular AI techniques such as 
machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), advanced analytics, natural language 
processing, knowledge discovery, and other relevant AI techniques as well as their 
hybridization can be used to provide solutions depending on the target applications. 
To provide an automated and data-driven intelligent cybersecurity solution, the 
majority of real-world scenarios involve advanced analytics, which leads to data 
science and analytical AI, that uses ML and DL techniques [ 1]. These techniques 
could also be considered a frontier of AI that has the potential to develop intelligent

systems and automate tasks. Figure 1.4 shows an illustration of the position 
of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) within the area of artiﬁcial 
intelligence (AI) as well as with data science (DS). DL is a subset of both ML and 
AI, and ML is a subset of AI, as demonstrated in Fig. 1.
