# Security Chapter Extract
Book: Wesley Palmer - Cybersecurity--Data Protection and Strategies (2025, Outskirts Press) - libgen.li
Chapter: 000 - Data included internal metrics as well as personal information, such as reviewers’ email addresses.
In May of 2018, Amazon’s security detected similar activity when they found that Amazon employees in China had been bypassing security controls, taking over customer accounts, and deleting customer reviews. These two incidents might not have been strictly related, as many of these employees appear to have been acting individually. But these kinds of internal threats have long been a persistent issue at Amazon.
May 2018: AMZ Review Caught Selling Customer Data
In May 2018, Amazon discovered that a third-party service was selling Amazon customer data to outside sellers. For years, Amazon had offered sellers broad access to customer data, such as name and address. AMZ Review compiled this data on a mass scale, and connected it to other customer information that had been leaked in other breaches.
AMZ Review had obtained information on up to 16 million Amazon customers. But the problem was even bigger: some third-party companies had access to up to a billion orders, and Amazon found that over half of third-party developers were violating Amazon’s terms of service.
In response, Amazon tightened its controls over customer data. But they did not make any public statements about the data leak. When reporters at Wired asked, an Amazon spokesperson insisted that “There was not a data leak”, but had “no response” regarding how many customers data had been inappropriately hoovered up by third-party companies.
May 2017: Up to 24 million Credit Card Numbers Exposed Internally
In May 2017, Amazon employees discovered a cache of American Express credit card numbers left unsecured on Amazon’s internal network. For at least several months, this credit card information was broadly available to Amazon employees. Because their audit logs only went back 90 days, it is unclear whether this openly available data was abused while sitting in the open.
July 2016: Hacker Claims to Breach 80,000 Amazon Accounts
In July 2016, a hacker identifying as #0x2Taylor claimed on Twitter to have breached an Amazon server and obtained personal information on more than 80,000 Kindle users. He threatened to leak the data if Amazon did not pay him $700. When Amazon did not pay him, he posted this information online.
However, Amazon denied that they had been breached: “We have confirmed that this information did not come from Amazon’s servers, and that the accounts in question are not legitimate Amazon customer accounts.” In this case, it’s hard to tell for sure whether or not Amazon was actually breached.
2016: Amazon Employees Spy on Customer Purchase Histories
In November 2021, Wired reported that back in 2016, it was common practice for Amazon employees to spy on customers’ purchase histories. In the words of one manager “Everybody, everybody did it.” Employees looked up the purchases of celebrities, such as Kanye West, and spied on their exes and romantic partners.
During this time, any customer service employee could look up practically any customer’s purchase history at any time. Because these access privileges were so widely distributed, it was easy for employees to abuse their power to spy on Amazon customers.
November 2015: Amazon Resets User Passwords as a Precautionary Measure
In November 2015, Amazon forced a reset on many user’s passwords. While there does not appear to have been an actual breach, Amazon seems to have identified a credible risk and taken this security measure just in case.
December 2014: Anonymous Hackers Leak Passwords for Amazon and Other Sites
In December 2014, hackers associated with the group Anonymous leaked 13,000 usernames and passwords for Amazon, Walmart, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and other websites. It is unclear where or how they obtained this information, though they did state their motive: “We did for the Lulz.”
January 2012: Zappos Breach Exposes 24 million Accounts
In January 2012, a hacker breached the servers of Zappos, an Amazon-owned online store. Although up to 24 million Zappos customers’ information was exposed in this attack, apparently Amazon accounts were not affected.
We did not find any earlier records of data breaches directly involving Amazon.

Source: Pandora papers: biggest ever leak of offshore data exposes financial secrets of rich and powerful | World news | The Guardian
The secret deals and hidden assets of some of the world’s richest and most powerful people have been revealed in the biggest trove of leaked offshore data history.
Branded the Pandora papers, the cache includes 11.9m files from companies hired by wealthy clients to create offshore structures and trusts in tax havens such as Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland, and the Cayman Islands.
They expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and head of state. They also shine a light on the secret finances of more than 300 other public officials such as government ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals in more than 90 countries.
The files include disclosures about major donors to the Conservative party, raising difficult questions for Boris Johnson as his party meets for its annual conference.
More than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars and business leaders. Many uses shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yacht, as well as incognito bank accounts. There is even art ranging from looted Cambodian antiquities by Picasso and murals by Banksy.
The Pandora papers reveal the inner workings of what is a shadow financial world, providing a rare window into the hidden operations of a global offshore economy that enables some of the world’s richest people to hide their wealth and in some cases pay little or no tax.

CASE 12
WHAT THE JP MORGAN CHASE DATA BREACH MEANS FOR CYBER SECURITY IN BANKING
SOURCE: CORRIN JONES (2021). REDRIVER.COM/SECURITY/BANK-DATA-BREACH
It is always alarming when a financial institution is the target of an attack, but it happens more frequently than most of us would like to acknowledge. Banking systems are highly secure, but they are also very large. And because they are always under attack, it makes sense that eventually a bank data breach will occur.
Cyber security in banking is strong, but it is not flawless. Many banks are still adapting to new cybersecurity issues, after decades of being relatively modest regarding their technology adoption and improvements. And there are always more lessons to learn.
Let’s take a look at what the JP Morgan Chase data breach in 2020 means for cyber security, especially in the banking industry.
THE ATTACK: A MISSING SECURITY FIX COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEMS
It’s believed that the JP Morgan Chase data breach occurred because of a single security fix that was not applied to a single system.
This happens more than people might think. Many systems are exceedingly complex, and there can be archaic areas of the system, such as apps that are infrequently used, that are not going through security updates. If the entire system is not controlled, it’s very easy for these issues to occur.
What can a company do? A company like Chase is in the financial industry — they undoubtedly have a robust internal department that should be concentrating on updates and patches. But most companies cannot have their own internal IT department. Instead, an MSP can help them ensure that nothing is missed.
Attacks can be extremely difficult to avoid. In the case of Chase, they were the victim of a targeted attack. Many companies will find themselves eventually compromised by such an attack. Companies need to be prepared to identify attacks and respond very quickly if an attack does breach their systems.
THE TIMELINE: J.P. MORGAN WAS COMPROMISED FOR TWO MONTHS
J.P. Morgan only noticed the attack because the hacker made a mistake; they were compromised for two months. This is very common. Some large organizations are compromised for over a year before they notice. And that is a problem. The longer a system is compromised, the more data can be accessed, the more damage a hacker can do, and the less likely it is for the hacker’s actions to be traced.
In fact, finding the attack in only two months was pretty good. Many similarly sized attacks have taken much longer to notice. However, J.P. Morgan has a very large security team. That is not really feasible for a lot of companies, especially the small-to-midsized businesses that are often targets.
So, what can companies do? Advanced scanning solutions make it easier to identify an attack when it occurs. Organizations have to be able to silo their data, especially their most important data, too — so they can be certain that this data was not compromised during an attack. The longer an attack is allowed to go on undetected, the more difficult it can be to recover.
THE HISTORY: J.P. MORGAN’S INSIDER THREATS
J.P. Morgan Chase has been the target of multiple insider threats. Though they were able to react swiftly to this data breach, they have actually experienced multiple breaches — sometimes with employees leaving with privileged information. This highlights the fact that a company’s employees are almost always their weakest link. You do not need to crack into a system if you already have access to all the data.
In addition to scanning for potential vulnerabilities, businesses also need to be very conscientious about user permissions. Businesses need to think about which users interact with which data and how easy it is to save this data to another system. Ideally, it should be very difficult for any data to be taken off the system.
While it is not known that the hack had anything to do with an insider, J.P. Morgan’s sustained issues have involved them. Systems administrators and outsourced professionals, like MSPs, can monitor employee actions and identify potentially suspicious behaviors — such as employees trying to access data that they do not usually access.
Breaches like the Chase security breach are going to happen. The JP Morgan hack did have a few factors going on, but realistically most banks can be cracked with concerted efforts. Companies need to be aware that if they become the target of a digital attack, it is very possible that their security will fail. What is hoped is that they will be able to react to those threats swiftly.

CASE 13
Yahoo Data Breach: What Actually Happened?
Source: Modern Cybersecurity Practices by Pascal Ackerman,
The past 15 years have seen some large scale and truly horrifying security breaches; some are so devastating that it bankrupted the victim company. A security or data breach is the intentional or unintentional release of secure or private/confidential information to an untrusted environment. Stolen Information, Stolen Information, Password Guessing, Recording Keystrokes, Phishing, Malware, and Denial-of-Service are some common types of data breaches. According to Forbes, Data breaches exposed 4.1 billion records in the first six months of 2019. On an organization level, AOL was the first victim of phishing attacks in 1996 but Yahoo Data Breach was the biggest data breach in history. Let us review and analyze the case.
Yahoo (2013–14)Impact: 3 billion user accountsYahoo Data Breach Settlement Amount: $117.5 million
Details
In September 2016, the once-mighty Internet titan, while trying to sell itself to Verizon, announced it had been the victim of a security breach. As it turns out, probably the biggest data breach in history. The breach was most likely the result of attacks by a state-sponsored actor that started in 2014. The compromise exposed the real names, email addresses, dates of birth, and telephone numbers of 500 million Yahoo users. The company revealed that most of the passwords involved had been hashed using the robust bcrypt algorithm. Bcrypt is an algorithm that hashes passwords with salt. A salt is a randomly chosen value, added to the hashing process, to make a hash unique even if the password that is hashed is identical. Using bcrypt makes passwords unusable unless cracked. As it turned out a couple of months later, Yahoo had been compromised before the breach. The company revealed that a different group of hackers had stolen the information of 1 billion accounts. Besides names, birthdates, email addresses, and passwords (these were not as well protected as those involved in 2014), security questions and answers were also compromised. Finally, in October of 2017, Yahoo revised its estimate, saying that all 3 billion user accounts had been compromised in this 2013 breach. The breaches cost Yahoo an estimated $350 million of the sale price to Verizon. Verizon ultimately paid 4.48 billion for Yahoo’s core Internet business. The sale agreement stipulated that the two companies shared regulatory and legal liabilities from the breaches.
Attack Vector (how they got in): Improper Input validation allowed attackers to take on any identity they choose by exploiting a weakness in the creation of user identifying and authorizing cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that get stored on the client device to overcome the inherent stateless behavior of web servers. Because a stateless web server has no direct means to remember the state or connection details about a connected client, an identifying piece of information is stored on the client (think unique ID code) in the form of a cookie. This cookie should be unique for every user or client connecting to the server, and it will allow the web application to correlate details about the user, typically stored in a database, to the client connection. This allows a normally stateless connection to remember you logged in and use that login to tie your user account to a set of authorized actions. Imagine that if the information stored in a cookie, the information that uniquely identifies a user of the system isn’t that unique, can be stolen or is guessable (as was the case with Yahoo), now an attacker can assume the identity of anyone and use the privileges that come with that account to do evil.
With Six Modern Cybersecurity Practices that kind of access, an attacker can assume the identity of every user and individually download all their personal information or find a privileged user with access to the application’s database or other supporting systems to place themselves into a position where they can mass extract data or mass destroy resources. Identifiable information should be unique and impossible to guess and should be useless if somehow stolen.

As per The Guardian, the hackers used “forged cookies” — bits of code that stay in the user’s browser cache so that a website does not require a login with every visit, wrote Yahoo’s chief information security officer, Bob Lord. The cookies ‘could allow an intruder to access users’ accounts without a password” by misidentifying anyone using them as the owner of an email account.
Security breaches are happening all around us to companies big and small. Not a day goes by where there is not some new victim in the media. The newest ones seem bigger and more involved than the previous cases reported.
