HTTP User Agent Analysis Dashboard:

Scenario: The IT department notices odd web requests that appear to come from unusual or out-of-date web browsers, suggesting the possibility of bot activity or a security breach.
How It Assists: With the use of user agent strings, the dashboard facilitates the analysis of online requests. By recognizing possibly harmful traffic from odd user agents, JIT Inc. can locate and look into these anomalies.
