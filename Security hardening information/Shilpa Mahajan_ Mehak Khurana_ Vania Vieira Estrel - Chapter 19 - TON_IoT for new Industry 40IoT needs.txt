TON_IoT for new Industry 4.0/IoT needs.

Intrusion detection relies heavily on binary (or basic) classification, exploiting different ML classifiers [86–97]. Still, some utilize other techniques like grouping through hyperparameter optimization, dataset class imbalance conundrum, and databank feature extraction [73, 101–125].
In multi‐category grouping, the databank comprehends multiple disconnected classes. Data items belonging to a similar category receive the same label. Besides the normal tag, other traffic classes exist, e.g., denial‐of‐service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and user‐to‐root (aka, remote‐to‐local) attacks. Multi‐category IDS sorting also applies different classifiers, advanced feature extraction tools [73, 101–125], hyperparameter classifiers’ tuning, and tactics to handle class imbalance [73, 101–125]. Classification can be binary and multi‐category for the intrusion detection problem. Multi‐category ones can address class imbalance, 3‐D or high‐dimensional data visualization, and feature extraction [104] problems for the datasets.


11.5.2 Secure and Continuous Monitoring
RT, secure continuous surveillance of systems and assets, helps understand their environment and perceive security events. AI can automate observations by delivering CTI via a dynamic, heterogeneous information network to manage data logs from perceiving physical environments, networks, customers, service suppliers, and sensitive information systems.
Security monitoring encompasses amassing, analyzing, and presenting data from various sources to develop an almost universal answer revealing the wrongdoer’s modus operandi and intents. This scenario actively requires efforts to process and correlate heterogeneous sources’ records [105] and situational awareness [73, 105–130] to understand security information. An essential problem is processing colossal, dynamic, and assorted security information from evolving and growing sources and algorithms. Thus, AI can offer meticulous analyses to chase coupled security events in a reliable, fine‐grained way. A system for event management with security information custom‐made for intelligent grids to detect, normalize, and correlate CAs and anomalies against a range of smart‐grid application layer protocols can be found in [105].
Similarly, physical and cyber domains’ logs can be combined and undergo data correlations to detect prospective critical infrastructure anomalies. RT situational awareness affords a holistic, particular view of large‐scale networks, enabling security analysts and investigators to recognize, process, and comprehend data. For this, a platform can process and visualize RT, large‐scale network data to monitor and study network flow data and develop novel analytics [73, 105–130]. An automated situational awareness platform can use RT awareness features via the “SW‐defined network” (SDN) to judge network‐enabled entities’ fragility, allocation to a connectivity‐appropriate slice, and the underlying infrastructure’s continuous surveillance. Maintaining an all‐inclusive CPSs situational awareness is desirable due to the bound cyber and physical systems’ combination in mission‐critical applications [73, 105–130].


11.5.3 Detection Processes
It involves activities to maintain detection readiness procedures to provide CTI and CS events awareness reliably while continuously refining and testing the detection processes for efficient working. AI can offer proactive online vigilance by automatic CTI extraction from innumerable web and internal resources. The resources embrace the DW, CTI sharing platforms, and honeypots. The following UCs detail AI practices for the maintenance of detection processes.
“DW investigation” (DWI) continuously monitors cybercrime resources, like criminal forums and the black market, to spot illicit activities and act to minimize risk. DW investigations occur by exploiting textual data SA from DW scenes [73, 105–130]. CTI utilizing DW data, besides identifying key attackers, their assets, and expertise levels can automate exploration tools to isolate potential CTs by analyzing hackers’ vocabulary and intentions without inspecting by hand the bulky DW posts’ volume. SA may automate textual opinions, views, and emotions mining via NLP. In this, a bilingual lexical resource (BiSAL) achieves the emotional analysis of English and Arabic texts linked to CTs, radicalness, and conflicts. An approach for predicting malign cyber events exploits malign actors’ behavior via SA of posts on hacker forums from the surface web and DWs to insert some predictive power usable outside the network to predict attacks using direction and time‐series models. Proactive CTI identifies and addresses security risks before CAs occur by collecting evidence from hacker forums and marketplaces offering products and services focusing on malicious attacks. An ML scheme can pursue attacks and the growth of infected devices via a DW traffic study appears. Their breakdown explores the underlying correlation between network services under attack, as designated by the target port amounts of scanning packets. Expert DW information retrieval techniques can support CT textual mining with business intelligence. Exploring DW forums is paramount to extracting key ideas and uncovering popular topics, emerging CTs, and key actors in the attacker community, benefiting CS professionals. Topic modeling may remove topics, track the evolution of matters, identify dangerous hackers with their fortes, and uncover their underground market role.
Automated assessment of diverse CTI sources assists in extracting handy information from plentiful sources like vulnerability databases, X (former Twitter), news sites, and incident reports to take timely actions to ensure overall system security. This involves processing knowledge from multiple sources about CTs and actors to improve safety and the decision‐making process and solve the problem of the quantity and heterogeneity of CTI sources and their formats to provide actionable intelligence. Security mavens face a fundamental challenge when exploring CS reports since immeasurable cyber information amounts emerge daily, imposing automated information mining technologies to simplify data retrieval and query. In this direction, there are innovative ways to extract evidence from CTI reports via named‐entity recognition to aid security analysts in gaining accurate threat specifics as quickly as possible. Well‐timed and relevant “OS intelligence” (OSINT) evidence mining posted daily by consumers, security organizations, and investigators is critical for maintaining a high‐security level. Twitter is a crucial OSINT platform and a CTI hub due to its natural aggregation capability, timeliness, centers for public and secretive opinions, and chiefest CS feeds (e.g., NVD, ExploitDB, CVE, Security Focus). So, social media processing pipelines and mining can extract sources’ CS relevance scores and concerns for clever verification.
Vulnerability intelligence extracts information about SW and system vulnerabilities from public vulnerability datasets (e.g., CVE and NVD) to help identify vulnerabilities and CA vectors to prioritize CS efforts and mending schedules. An automated system can diagnose and detect potential IoT vulnerabilities in a specific content‐based extraction ontology provoked by evidence fluctuations fostered by the CVE databank and IoT system circumstances.
CS data explosive growths on platforms [73, 105–130], the DW, and social sites require automated tools for CT evolution identification, structured CTI records’ generation, CT warning, and CTI appraisals from local CTI sources. A dynamic topic modeling can show the key topics’ evolution in a time‐stamped CS document collection to identify the threat evolution. The growing unstructured data nature shared on “OS threat intelligence publishing platforms” (OSTIPs) deters automatic CTI records gatherings. Automatic structured CTI data generation from OSTIPs combines ML and NLP to accomplish accurate, structured, and detailed data that can readily empower security tools and specialists regarding CT alleviation. The early CT warning systems helped defend against CAs by sending timely outbreaks and security alerts through information feeds. Security experts’ Tweets and related blogs/social media can be mined to issue a CT warning. CTI tools targeting specific languages can help CTI professionals gain better CT insights in their local language. An automated Chinese analyzing structure to increase CTI visibility can operate in cooperation with preparing an automatic classification framework containing RS and CT‐labeling tactics.
CS data explosive growths on platforms, the DW, and social sites require automated tools for CT evolution identification, structured CTI records generation, CT warning, and CTI appraisals from local CTI sources.
Multilingual CTI needs stem from Internet demands for translating CTI sources to draw trustworthy conclusions. Third‐party translation engines are unsuitable due to their lack of CS terminology and inadequate privacy and confidentiality policies, where the importance of developing CTI tools for non‐English languages must be highlighted [73, 105–130].
AI‐powered honeypots study CAs’ tactics and behaviors to expand and prepare CS systems for attacks [73, 105–130]. For a case in point, honeypots can rely on ML to predict the CA probability, utilizing numerous honeypots’ DW or data sites to preclude far‐reaching security events at the earliest. Mixing ML and honeynet‐reliant detection can flag a potential botnet camouflaged as an IoT device. An early‐warning IDS can apply a distributed network with honeypots and darknets for data collection.



11.6 Response Function (RF)
RF creates a roadmap for managing and restraining potential CS events’ impacts. RF is critical as it epitomizes the first defense line in incident management and develops mitigation tactics for the future. This function includes planning to create effective processes to address the caveat, analyzing incidents to define their cause, scope, impact, incident containment, and communication orchestration throughout and, subsequently, to an attack. AI‐reliant response activities can resolve incidents faster and with less labor and time from security analysts. Various AICS and UC solutions follow.

11.6.1 Response Planning
Planning a well‐maintained reaction course of actions to pursue during and after an incident to limit its scope and impact includes defining a contingency plan that captures various CA scenarios with the apt response action and incorporating experiences gathered from other incidents’ responses to revise plans. AI can automate response planning by launching a dynamic case supervision tool to record, perform, and modernize the contingency plan.
Dynamic case management utilizes technologies that tackle prior security breaches to record various attack scenarios and suggest relevant reaction measures before an event occurs [73, 105–130]. This helps with knowledge management for recording when an event is closed and organizing the response activities for particular breach types. Most studies have been on automated response recommendations that employ CBR to match the most comparable incident from a knowledge manager and then update the knowledge manager after the occurrence. Domain experts outline the precedent model in a case‐based CTincs resolution system for preserving and retrieving knowledge base precedents. Researchers actively apply a hierarchical structure, ML, and an ontological approach to formalize the precedent base. A hierarchical structure with the qualities of the “recency, frequency, and monetary” (RFM) method can quickly respond to a security breach. Their scheme contemplates the security event’s circumstances by observing its frequency and various attribute values. The target organization, information on the intruders, disturbed resources, and potential effects on the target are just attributes from prospective assault scenarios that can be accumulated in a hierarchical structure. Maintaining, reusing, and sharing the problem‐solving knowledge of CTincs resolution is possible by mingling CBR with the incident‐object description exchange format. The K‐nearest neighbor procedure can handle case similarity. An RS can map CTincs into embeddings with ANNs and find the nearest incident embedding to sanction a similar resolution measure.


11.6.2 Communications
This activity helps coordinate stakeholders’ communication during and after a CTinc, including collaboration support between security analysts throughout an attack and cross‐sector CTI partaking to enrich the protection team’s responses in emergencies and warrant contingency tasks and responsibilities’ allocation when responding [73, 105–130]. AI can assist with this activity via these two UCs.
“Automated responsibility allocation” (ARA) can serve as intelligent and adaptive decision sustenance for “security operation center” (SOC) managers in incident response duties substantiated by the occurrence traits, staff expertise, and ease of use. The best resources (like time or extra labor) are directed toward maintaining a cyber‐SOC optimal operational effectiveness in the face of multiple factors’ interference, viz new alert categories, augmenting alert‐generation rate, and expert absenteeism. Nonetheless, stochastic, dynamic programming‐based, adaptive, and dynamic decision‐making model via RL exists.
“Collaboration support systems” (CSSs) facilitate the efficient data and knowledge allotment amongst various actors participating in incident response, for example, teams and employees inside or outside the organization [4, 73, 105–130]. AI can help with cyber‐defense, analytical CSS support for cross‐sector CTI partaking, and community data distribution between security analysts. CSSs are twofold: asynchronous and synchronous. Asynchronous CSSs do not provide RT communication; team members can examine information when convenient, i.e., engage in a conversation or leave according to a present necessity. A CSS type employing a message board and utilizing a cross‐sector CTI sharing with a multi‐agent monitoring mechanism may solve the concurrency problems of CTI sharing and improve tasks’ execution efficiency. Synchronous CSSs provide RT communication to support an RT response by yielding security analysts to quickly exchange findings and introduce effective task divisions. The last concept with visualization, RT communication, and the efficient conversion of BD can be handled by plentiful analysts to broadly comprehend CTs and corresponding responses.


11.6.3 Analysis
The analysis module evaluates CTincs and response activities to ensure the correct incident mitigation process, gathering and evaluating received data to support event categorization and notify investigators to assess incident severity and impact. Forensic analysis helps retrieve and preserve evidence for litigation. AI can analyze these use case procedures.
Automatic incident characterization (AIC) addresses the incident identification processes per the response plan, including identifying incident criticality and relationships with other incidents to automatically prioritize incidents for further investigation. Different CS events [73, 105–130] dictate the adequate AI model type or action per occurrence’s severity.
Alert processing and triage (APTr) investigate intrusion alerts efficiently and accurately to prioritize and analyze their relationship and decide on incident response. AICS can enable an effective alert triage established on automated knowledge inference, alert classification, and alert prioritizing tools [2, 4, 33] to identify and escalate CT alerts for further investigation. Knowledge inference explores the knowledge base with logical rules for new information evaluations and interpretations. A sequential rule mining scheme that extracts knowledge from shared intrusion detection alerts can create predictive and customized blocklists. Aggregating or key triaging warns from enormous CT alert records can reduce CT alert fatigue. Security warnings related to the same attack scenario could be grouped using “self‐organizing maps” (SOMs) and unsupervised clustering techniques. Each evaluated event characteristic had an anomaly score to determine security event priority and identify anomalies.
Post‐mortem forensic analysis (FA) starts a CA timeline [2, 4, 73, 105–130]. It illuminates the breach’s scope and cause. Next, remove and prevent the threat via tools and approaches. The invader’s data pieces are also examined to establish a footprint that can be utilized in court or for prosecution. Incident response teams can use AI for intelligent attribution, anomaly identification in a forensic chronology, evidence correlation from different devices, and forensic investigation optimization. Smart attribution finds entity‐event links to determine security event causes. Contextual learning can indicate source attribution and status. A forensic chronology covers pre‐, mid‐, and post‐CTincs events. Identify anomalies in the forensic timeline, such as security incidents. A deep autoencoder can establish a baseline model for log file normal occurrences and an anomaly threshold for reconstructed values using the baseline to identify anomalies. Fraud detection and analysis are forensic investigators’ key goals for court case reports. Various forensic tools can analyze devices.
Nonetheless, their data formats complicate studies. Thus, a novel semantic strategy helps forensic investigators analyze evidence by linking it with other knowledge. New adversarial tools make it difficult for forensic analysis teams to examine occurrences quickly and efficiently within scarce resources’ scenarios. A unique decision support system model uses CTI data from adversarial scheme repositories to aid inspections, optimizing forensic breakdowns by resolving these issues. The likelihood relationship and proximity values between potential attack actions, present investigation findings, and investigation budget are considered in this model.


11.6.4 Mitigation
Mitigation involves preventing the expansion outbreaks and remediating their effects to dispel any long‐term security breach consequences. This critical step contains the incident facts and remediates or documents new frailties concerning risks.
“Automated isolation” (AuI) excludes devices after detecting an indicator of compromise. AuI disconnects devices or gadgets’ groups after infection or identifies high‐risk infected clients for extra care. NFV and SW‐defined networking lets AuI locate CAs on the physical network and isolate or replace compromised devices or clients. CS professionals can reduce CA consequences in networks by tying CAs to specific physical system attributes or metrics. A CA classification and localization model for the smart grid physical layer uses ensemble and representational learning for CA classification and a Chi‐squared algorithm to correlate the CA scenario with specific features and localize the attack to precise measurements or a system location [73, 105–130]. RT mitigation is essential for fast vulnerability processing in integrated clinical environments. ML/DL can detect and categorize ransomware threats and leverages NFV and SDN out to isolate and replace affected devices.
“Automated remediation” (AuR) is a guided problem‐solving method that automates corrective measures with simple scripts or powerful context‐aware RSs [73, 105–130]. AI can choose the best countermeasures for CT removal in RSs to help security analysts configure and orchestrate security tools and track the attacker’s lateral movement. A defensive CS key pillar is developing speedy and effective responses to disruptive CAs, and picking the appropriate countermeasures to reply to CTs is crucial for a fully automatic response. CS reaction based on artificial immune systems can select and apply the optimal atomic countermeasures for risky protected structure assets. Decision support systems and intelligent RSs for security analysts to swiftly and effectively defend resources and services from CAs are also important. An RS suggests the most resilient critical infrastructure setup with network orchestration and security technologies for fast mitigation and to quickly stop malware spread or track the attacker’s lateral movement.


11.6.5 Improvements
Improvements ensure lessons are absorbed from incident detections and response activities, including response update plans and strategies consistent with the lessons learned by employing AI for automated knowledge extraction [2, 4, 73, 105–130] centered on incident reports.
“Long‐term improvements” (LTIs) entail knowledge extraction from incidents, and CTI reports arrange for dependable corroboration so that security analysts detect or find CA indicative patterns. A framework can mine knowledge from after‐action reports, aggregate it by grouping similar items, and display retrieved facts in CS knowledge graphs. This arrangement helps security analysts to find matches between different CAs [73, 105–130].



11.7 Recovery Function (RcF)
RcFs primarily warrant CS resilient designs with well‐timed restitution of abilities or services, fostering a prompt return to regular operations to lessen the CS event impact and distill important information as lessons learned. RcF can assist in returning to normal with the help of these CS solutions.
Recovery planning involves processes and procedures for maintenance, testing, and execution to restore systems or assets compromised by CT incidents, timely recuperating lost data, and impaired capacities to ensure that everything functions aptly. AI‐based recovery planning can automate data and system recovery and delete malware or tainted data during a CT event.
Security incident reviews improve recovery by understanding security breaches. It involves updating recovery methods based on lessons learned and reviewing efforts to meet security goals. AI may automatically identify advanced breach prospects for future response planning by reviewing policies, incident reports, and audit logs. Analyzing and combining security incident data and reports can furnish insights and suggestions to improve CS. Unfortunately, incident data management and analyses are strenuous and slow. AI can simplify data collection, aggregation, information extraction, visualization, and prediction of heterogeneous incident material for post‐mortem vulnerability assessments with NLP [61].
Communication restores inner‐outer synchronization. A platform for communicating recent security breaches or CTs promises to ensure critical infrastructure CS.
The “recovery function” (RcF) primary goal is to maintain resilience planning and the timely restoration of abilities or services impaired due to a CS incident, encouraging a prompt return to normal operations to lessen the CS event impact and distill important information as lessons learned. RcF can serve as a roadmap for returning to normal with the help of the next CS solutions.


11.8 Analysis, Discussion and Research Gaps
AI Smartly stated algorithms, data, structures, and knowledge formalisms are AI. The key AI fields for analysis encompass thinking, development, learning, communication, and perspicacity. Primary reasoning domain studies examine how machines infer from data. Planning automates strategy design and execution using cautiously optimized solutions. Automatic learning, prediction, adaptation, and change response are addressed in the learning domain. Communication domain studies focus on machines’ ability to understand, interpret, and produce spoken or written human dialogues. Perception domain studies examine visual and auditory environmental sensing.
AICS research requires developing application areas, adequate resources (e.g., data sources, records management, computing infrastructure), and advanced AI approaches for AICS adoption. Emerging CS applications, data representation, enhanced AICS methodologies, and new infrastructure research and development are promising research fields.

11.8.1 Emerging CS Areas
Advancing AICS obliges a solid foundation for multiple application domains. Likewise, the future necessitates new CS activities’ automation and existing CS continuing amelioration. The emergent applications are described below:
Automated retrieval of key VRIs encourages future research about early‐warning structures to signpost risk happenings over time due to policy abuses, red flags, or other indicators. Automatically retrieving key risk indicators, like the manifestation of unpatched modules, attempted breaches’ totals, average in‐between failure times, etc., and transforming them into beneficial knowledge to prevent a CS breach by timely remediation of the risk.
Zero‐day CA defense is one of modern CS’s most intriguing challenges. CAs targeting fresh SW vulnerabilities are called zero‐day attacks. Naturally, guarding against something you don’t know exists is difficult. This requires full ICT visibility across endpoints, networks, and CC.
Predictive intelligence simplifies common CS decisions like vulnerability categorization, attack route prediction, malware forecast, data triage, spam filtering, security estimation, and mission mapping. Despite being widely used and well‐defined, many methods are manual or have significant false positive rates. Advanced, sophisticated predictive analytics can address some of these challenges. Time‐centered neural graph networks, deep Bayesian forecasting, burst recognition, deep generative prototypes with temporal constrictions, and other predictive methods appear promising. Industrial policies, information, tasks, and needs can be included in each plan. Superior operational and tactical business projections can benefit SOC analysts and CTI experts.
The Internet’s linguistic character requires CS to creatively mine social media, blogs, and DW markets. CAs mainly target non‐English‐speaking nations [73, 105–130]. Thus, non‐English content datasets should gauge TM in other languages. Lots of pre‐processing tools and libraries solely support English. For private security, new technologies targeting other idioms or translators are needed.
AI‐powered cyber protection and resilience use analytics to automatically deploy security rules. Threat modeling, patching, remediation, network segmentation, and reorganization are automated. Intelligent work automation benefits SOC analysts and operators greatly. Modern AI capabilities include enhanced AI agents, RL, actor critical networks, chosen defensive, adversarial learning schemes, and Bayesian networks. Future research can determine how each strategy protects scientific cyberinfrastructure, enterprise IT, sensor‐ and actuator‐based settings, etc.
Data breach prevention and discovery require significant investigators’ attention because most research focuses on insider behavior or endpoint telemetry to detect insider CTs and “advanced persistent threats” (APTs). However, sensitive data identification studies to prevent unintentional exposure are inadequate. ML and NLP can find, monitor, and govern sensitive data flow between endpoints in big‐data environments to avoid or analyze data leakages. DW’s search for inadvertent exposures is essential to regaining control and reputation.
Fake document generation protects critical assets like intellectual property and national security records, contributing to the utmost cyber warfare impact. AI synthetic document generation means safeguarding sensitive material by information falsification to produce several counterfeit documents [4].
Security teams necessitate skilled CTI professionals to process and triage thousands of warnings and events methodically collected for daily threat analysis. Current research uses high‐level management to correlate security alerts, analyze their logical relationship, and prioritize them before sending them to consumers. They avoid distinct network event settings. Other language models can learn event context representations and construct adaptive methods for dynamic network contexts. Additional data visualization and online updating capacity are needed for alerts and efficient triage mechanism design.
Due to the shorter time it takes an attacker to take over an enterprise’s infrastructure, AI‐powered incident response must be rapid. Also important is automating assault mitigation, containment, and outsmarting. Incident response automation requires knowledge documentation from prior CTincs, events caused by a solution, and new CT patterns and attributes throughout time. This knowledge can enable automated incident response playbooks to recommend, allocate resources, and assign tasks based on expertise, availability, and case history. These automated security playbooks will reinforce proactive protection and prevent hardening CTs. Future CTI platforms will allow enterprises to consume these standardized security playbooks to respond to incidents in real‐time.


11.8.2 Data Representation
Effective AI needs good data. The major issues are choosing training datasets and managing data diversity and velocity. Data representation and quality, mining the latest facts, and context awareness are crucial for AICS model training and modeling.
AI needs “refined data representations” to perform. Flattened feature vectors are most commonly used to describe CS. Despite its popularity, this technique ignores essential data links like sequences. Thus, in production, this representation can yield worse results. Future AICS researchers could carefully assess how CS data exist in the CPS or parts of it and find proper replacements best portraying the studied phenomena to alleviate this problem. Trees or graphs showing data dependencies can characterize virtual machines’ hierarchical file schemes and applications. Sequences, grids, and non‐Euclidean depictions (e.g., tensors, cubes) also require adequate representations that consider essential data features, organizational needs, and relevant social and behavioral economics theories.
CS data possess a variety of low‐level properties due to context awareness. Data mining and ML can find a meaningful pattern for datasets. However, temporal and spatial relationships/dependencies between occurrences or connections can explain if an action is suspicious. For example, security professionals may not consider linkages evil, but other strategies may consider them DoS assaults. The inability to predict threats or attacks by contextual knowledge weakens CS. AI research includes context‐aware adaptive CS solutions.
“Incremental Learning and Regency Mining” refer to how ML‐based security models make data‐driven choices using static data. However, consumers’ and malignant opponents’ behavior may change over time. Thus, contemporary behavioral patterns and ML rules promise more regarding predictive analytics in typical CS jobs like data triage, spam filtering, vulnerability categorization, and mission mapping. Effectively exploiting analysis outcomes to craft solutions is another AICS research problem.


11.8.3 Advanced AICS
More advanced AI may maximize the data sources, application regions, and representations. Multiple data source analysis, “explainable AI” (XAI), and “automated human‐AI” interactions are nascent tactics affecting practical and usable AICS. Understanding how and why an algorithm concludes is vital for XAI applications in CS. Unfortunately, existing AI decision‐making is opaque. They are known for their “black box” character despite their superior performance in high‐impact CS applications like DW investigations, vulnerability assessments, and others. Future AICS research can decipher interpretable and explicable AI to improve an algorithm’s performance and reveal its black‐box nature to reduce these constraints, enhancing stakeholder trust.
“Multiple Data Source Analysis” can fix AICS’s biggest problem, i.e., isolated datasets, which means lacking access to multiple datasets or failing to compare and interpret them. Future AICS research should use other data sources’ properties more to address this issue. Entity matching, short‐text matching algorithms (like deep structured semantic models), multi‐view approaches (e.g., multi‐source), and multi‐task learning promise many data source analysis solutions. Fusion of information can yield additional attributes, improved risk management (e.g., vulnerability assessments), and a complete picture of an organization’s CS posture.
“Human‐AI Interfaces” improve decision‐making by integrating AI with human action (e.g., having a security expert run an analysis). AI‐human interfaces can surpass algorithms and humans. Although needed, human‐AI interaction’s range, breadth, and depth in critical and fundamental tasks have not yet been fully explored. Psychology, cognitive science, human‐computer interaction, and other domains might inform such transdisciplinary research.


11.8.4 Exploring and Developing Innovative Infrastructures
AI is becoming a key CS component for enterprises of all sizes and industries to improve CS productivity. Developing new RT infrastructures to assist AI requires dealing with internal BD and external security research feeds to give CS for global and internal security incidents. Key research gaps for successful AICS designs follow.
Cyber reality is complicated by the lack of national/international CTI platforms and their dynamic character, albeit new CTs and CAs can evade it. Proprietary platforms must debate and share CT data with peers. CTI platforms must be flexible, adaptable, and networked to share CT information, relying mainly on selected national and international information‐sharing hubs currently lacking. The government, owners, and operators of critical infrastructure and others will profit from efficiently distributing accurate, functional, timely, and relevant CT information shared by CTI platforms. Sharing improves situational awareness and risk‐informed decision‐making, boosting critical infrastructure security and dependability.
Lack of fresh, RT, or larger datasets: AICS datasets are the most important. Most are old and may not explain CA behavior today. Many detection investigations used AI approaches on the same dataset (e.g., DARPA98, KDD99, NSLKDD, and CICIDS2017); nevertheless, their methods have not been evaluated on newer datasets. Validating context research across several datasets allows scenario analysis.



11.9 Conclusion
CS includes methods, tools, and processes that aid companies in safeguarding networks, devices, SW, and data from CA, damage, and unauthorized access. Complex CS is needed as devices, systems, and networks proliferate exponentially.
A taxonomy defines existing frameworks at the first bottom two CS NIST levels to identify and gauge possible AICS applications. IaaS has five main functions: identification (IF), protection (PF), detection (DF), response (RF), and recovery (RcF). Preventing security threats, actively searching for new CTs, and counterattack maneuvers are AI functions. To defend CAs, IaaS regulates their lifecycle particular characteristics.
Numerous activities stemming from different AICS techniques regarding taxonomy are examined: contribution type and the AI model targeting the IaaS layer. An in‐depth assessment of specific user cases and theoretical investigations further enriches these issues. This chapter inspects the AICS evolution by analyzing and identifying research gaps about functions, solution sets, specific UCs, and the elected AI technique. Still, practical AICS implementations require more attention to acquiring and representing chronological data related to different CS functions [131-135].
