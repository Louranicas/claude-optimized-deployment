produced the programming language KL IC and the legal reasoning system 
HELIC-II. In 1983, the ICOT had less than 50 researchers and the research 
themes, focused around the central proj ect of designing the world’s largest 
computer by 1990, directly concerned AI  (e.g. automatic translation systems, 
automatic response systems, understa nding speech, understanding images, 
problem-solving systems and logic programming machines, etc.). 
In 1986, the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI) was 
founded. In 1990, the association created the  Pacific Rim International 
Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI), which aims to structure AI 
research in this part of the world, thus complementing or counterbalancing 
the Western initiatives of the IJCAI and the  European Conference on 
Artificial Intelligence. 
Alongside university research, industrial R&D activities have made a 
major contribution to the developmen t of Japanese artificial intelligence. 
Major industrial groups set up teams dedicated to AI (NTT, Hitachi, Fujitsu,
