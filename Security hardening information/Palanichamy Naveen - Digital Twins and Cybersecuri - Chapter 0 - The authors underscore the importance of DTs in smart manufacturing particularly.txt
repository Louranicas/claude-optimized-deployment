Understanding Digital Twins  21
Real-Time Interactions and Optimization
With the advancements in connectivity and computing power, digital twins gained the ability to interact with their physical counterparts in real time. This allowed for continuous monitoring, remote control, and optimization of physical assets based on the insights and simulations provided by the digital twin. For example, in smart manufacturing, real-time adjustments can be made to optimize production processes based on the performance data captured by the digital twin.
Pan et al. address the challenges of managing operational dynamics in 
production logistics systems, particularly in response to the increasing demand for customized products. The research proposes a multi-level cloud computing-enabled digital twin system for real-time monitoring, decision-making, and control of a synchronized production logistics sys -
tem. This system integrates internet of things (IoT) technology to capture real-time dynamics in the physical layer and effectively evaluates its impact on the system’s operation in the digital layer. The paper emphasizes the use of edge computing, fog computing, and cloud computing to handle dynamics at various levels efficiently and economically. A production logistics synchronization (PLS) optimization model is presented, focusing on production and storage, with an industrial case study demonstrating its effectiveness. The authors discuss the existing challenges in production logistics, including dynamics discrimination, real-time comprehensive state perception, and the need for a quantitative real-time optimization method. The proposed solution involves a three-level digital twin frame -
work and a synchronization mechanism based on multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) methods. They include an analysis of the system’s dynamics, a digital twin control framework, and a collaborative optimiza -
tion approach, culminating in a case study that verifies the method’s fea-sibility [6].
Integration with Cyber-Physical Systems
The evolution of digital twins coincided with the rise of cyber-physical systems, where the physical and digital worlds are tightly interconnected. Digital twins became an integral part of cyber-physical systems, providing a bridge between the virtual and physical realms. This integration enabled seamless communication, synchronization, and control between the dig -
ital twin and the physical asset, facilitating real-time optimizations and decision-making.

of cyber-physical integration, with a particular focus on cyber-physical 
systems (CPS) and digital twins (DTs), which are essential for enhancing manufacturing systems’ efficiency, resilience, and intelligence. The authors extensively review and contrast CPS and DTs across various dimensions, including their origins, development, and core elements. They highlight how both CPS and DTs stem from the integration of physical and digital/cyber worlds, yet differ in their primary focus areas and applications. The authors also discuss the hierarchical modeling of CPS and DTs in manu -
facturing, which ranges from unit level to system level and system of sys -
tems (SoS) level, illustrating how these technologies are implemented at different scales. Furthermore, they explore the function implementation of CPS and DTs, noting how they are both deeply integrated with new infor -
mation technologies. The comparison of CPS and DTs is extended to their integration with new IT, examining their roles in facilitating smart man-ufacturing. Finally, the authors conclude by reiterating the importance of cyber-physical interaction and integration in achieving smart manufactur -
ing, emphasizing the distinct but complementary roles of CPS and DTs in this context. The study opens avenues for further research in both technol -
ogies to advance smart manufacturing [7].
Ecosystem-Level Digital Twins
The concept of digital twins expanded beyond individual assets or processes to encompass entire ecosystems. Ecosystem-level digital twins provide a comprehensive view of interconnected systems, enabling organizations to understand the complex relationships and dependencies between various components. For example, in smart cities, ecosystem-level digital twins can simulate and optimize energy distribution, traffic flow, and environ -
mental factors.
Rantala et al. examine how industrial organizations transition from 
using digital twins at an organizational level to a broader, ecosystem level. Digital twins, initially focusing on representing physical objects, have 
evolved to embody entire organizations, enhancing operations, decision-  
making, and collaboration. The study explores this shift through longitu -
dinal case studies in Finland, highlighting the progression from internal to ecosystem-level digital twin utilization. Key findings include the growing importance of human-centered approaches in value creation, the incli -
nation of organizations to extend their digital twin applications beyond internal boundaries, and the exploration of multi-sided platforms around digital twins. The study contributes to understanding the evolving role of digital twins in industrial settings, focusing on value creation and ecosys -
tem-level applications [8].
