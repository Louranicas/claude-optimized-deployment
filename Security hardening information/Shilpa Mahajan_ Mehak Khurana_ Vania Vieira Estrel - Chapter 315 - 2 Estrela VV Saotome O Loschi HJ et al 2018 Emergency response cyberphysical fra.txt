14.1 Introduction
A “business sector” can be any potential application field, such as banking, agribusiness, disaster relief, etc. Nowadays, the “cyber‐physical system” (CPS) rationale [1–4], i.e., a framework placing together computation (aka virtualized building blocks) with physical (real) processes whose conduct depends on the computational and physical parts. Within a CPS, devices can exchange information and intermingle with the physical realm through sensors and actuators that observe and control the hardware (HW) and software (SW) processes in a feedback loop. The amalgamation of sensing, actuation, computation, and communication competencies expands the overall performance, security, and reliability. This set of circumstances brings to mind “cybersecurity” (CS) concerns for CPSs, the “Internet of Things” (IoT) gadgets and the “extended IoT” (XIoT) that are an integral growing part of significant business sectors related to infrastructures, governments, and quotidian life [5, 6]. This chapter implies that CS is the practice of safeguarding against unwanted assaults on HW, servers, mobile devices, “information and communication technologies” (ICT) systems, networks, SW, and data [6–8].
Today, a knowledge sector may encompass many issues, including local face‐to‐face care or amenities, faraway databank access, laboratory analysis, online public awareness, and administrative business tasks [9]. In contrast, inspecting and controlling facilitates service control and aids service suppliers in helping the public outside the business’ tangible facility, properly tracking stakeholders’ aftermaths, ongoing superior services, and identifying at‐risk folks. It also enables participants to maintain contact with their providers, comply with schedules, and mend trust and wellness processes. Instead, persons in remote areas lack access to modern services due to technology and staff deficiencies. Real‐time observation and well‐being of all participants (stakeholders), real environments, and other ignored stakeholders, be it a person, animal, or small area. IoT‐based “general CPS ontology” (GCPSO) management may rely on mobile devices, terminals, or other technology that affords constructive and preventive remote interventions [10], accomplishing emergent individuals’/businesses’ demands and high operational costs. It interconnects accessible assets and delivers smart, safe, and inexpensive services.
The IoT is a mainly physical technology system, e.g., buildings, in‐body, on‐body, and out‐body gadgets, administration facilities, research centers, and local face‐to‐face services, in which full people’s information access is assured through the Internet. Such up‐and‐coming technologies assist advancement in modernization due to Internet and computing HW developments. The “general intelligent blockchain CS CPS” (GIBCS‐CPS) centers on a structure that employs participants’ resources, including reliable information, multimedia coordination, and records retrieval blended with possible remote decision‐making and control [6–8]. The IoT integration in inspecting and control systems has impediments owing to “big data” (BD) and the obligation for encryption protocols to inhibit people’s records from leaking [11]. Any malicious individual’s or corporation’s intervention contrariwise will expose and manipulate participant’s data in any fashion with serious repercussions, even demises [12, 13].
A secure, real‐time monitoring and control system must confront previous matters, maximizing emergent security advantages plus ICT. A “wireless sensor and actuator (or actor) network” (WSAN) designates wireless communication via devices holding (i) sensors to monitor ecological and physical conditions pertaining to individuals, areas, or objects and (ii) multiple actuators, such as servomechanisms, motors, valves, drug‐delivering units, and drones, to perform actions. WSANs can gather facts from the region of interest, aka application (i.e., ecology‐related settings, trading markets, automated buildings, agribusinesses, live beings bodies, harvests, etc.) to control the indispensable entity’s traits undergoing inspection. WSANs comprehend paramount IoT and Industry 4.0 forming elements for creating intelligent businesses, environments, agrarian locales, cities, medical scenarios, etc. [14–19]. An effective WSAN installation calls for subjugating many hindrances and delivering reliable services. These comprise the dynamic and intelligent supervision of sensors and actuators, the asset‐limited network nodes’ nature, and the continuous, robust, and secure data exchange between HW sections.
WSAN’s distinctive control/data decoupling tackles remote observation and efficient application sector devices’ control. Conversely, blockchain technology preserves the participant’s history records, and sensors acquire information securely and confidentially without alteration prospects. For this reason, WSANs [13] and blockchain sub‐systems [20, 21] within the target CPS can be a directly positive effect solution. This chapter investigates an efficient and reliable GCPSO to inhibit any insider/outsider intruder from inoculating data, falsifying data, violating participants’ secrecy, or even instigating a “denial of service” (DoS) “cyberattack” (aka “cyber threat” (CT)) against the GCPSO [4, 20, 21]. The GIBCS‐CPS also offers a modular trust management implementation founded on blockchain technology, CS defenses, and decision‐making benefits from these technologies from the GCPSO perspective. The recommended GIBCS‐CPS boosts priorities and manages concerns concerning trust. Simultaneously, it defends various monitoring and control system components while protecting stakeholders’ privacy by fashioning a secure environment where separate security modules coexist to warrant a consistent GCPSO.
Conversely, several person‐centered solutions emphasize “knowledge domain bases” (KDBs) management, which involves all individual‐related records, comprising the protection and trust facets of data, HW, and SW [22, 23]. Ideally, the network, monitoring, and control must require fewer improvements than the participants’ side. This rationale can cause undesired situations, principally with remote work, owing to the minimization of stakeholders’ physical contact, dislocation time, and stress, among other actors. This chapter establishes the minimum HW/SW framework for protected, trusted remote checking and control of CPS and partakers’ processes as follows:

A remote, real‐time, and protected stakeholders’ monitoring and control architecture via blockchain and WSAN,
A scalable, flexible structure that can start/ turn off any module while sustaining other modules’ functionalities, and
An efficient, lightweight “trust management scheme” (TMS) for monitoring and controlling a business sector.

Numerous algorithms’ input data make up valuable features. However, Internet data are limitless, and exploiting their authorization can be tricky, occasioning extremely difficult‐to‐handle data verification scenarios in complex CPSs. So, designs that assist in robustifying data storage, processing, and sharing in‐depth operations across Internet environments are essential. These designs produce a more genuine, secure BD cyberspace and improve algorithms on various information sources.
The chapter is outlined as follows:
