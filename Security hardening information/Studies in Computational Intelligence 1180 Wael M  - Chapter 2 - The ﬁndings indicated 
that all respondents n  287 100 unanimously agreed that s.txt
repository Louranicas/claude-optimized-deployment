be effectively managed. As shown in Table 3, the majority of respondents (n = 251, 
87.33%) revealed that a lack of privacy and safety for students, due to various content 
leading to distraction and a lack of user focus, is  a major obstacle. This was followed 
by the digital divide (n = 240, 83.58%), which results in unequal access to te ch-
nology and internet connectivity among students, me aning that not all students can 
beneﬁt equally from social media initiatives and th e inconsistency among growing 
social media users. Additionally, 231 respondents ( 80.56%) acknowledged a lack 
of adequate staff training and resources, and 219 r espondents (76.23%) stated that 
librarians faced challenges due to the absence of f eedback from users, making it 
difﬁcult for them to analyze gaps and further impro ve the content delivery platform. 
Equally, 253 respondents (88.20%) strongly agreed t hat the lack of a social media 
policy and guidelines is one of the major challenge s every school library should 
address to achieve the successful integration of so cial media networks. Conversely, 
the majority of respondents strongly agreed that to  effectively manage these chal-
lenges, there is a need for developing a social med ia policy (n = 230, 80.20%), 
content creation and management (n = 221, 77.09%), monitoring and evaluation (n 
= 230, 80.05%), and regular staff training (n = 259, 90.11%).
Table 3 above outlines the main challenges that school libr aries face when 
integrating social media networks and the suggested  solutions to address these issues. 
4.4 Best Practices and Successful Case Studies of S ocial 
Media Use in School Libraries

social media integration in school libraries, and h ow do they contribute to promoting 
literacy and academic excellence in their respectiv e schools?” They were asked 
to respond on a Likert scale ranging from ‘not at a ll innovative’ to ‘extremely 
innovative,’ as shown in Table
