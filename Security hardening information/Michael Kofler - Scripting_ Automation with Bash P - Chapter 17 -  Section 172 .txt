In a nutshell, the implementation of the simple idea of this example faces several hurdles in practice.








21    Virtual MachinesAs long as you use virtual machines only sporadically, automation does not make any sense. You may want to consider using a tool for faster setup of new virtual machines (such as Vagrant).The situation is completely different if you want to automatically create, configure, maintain, and analyze a large number of virtual machines, for example, for a lab (teaching), for cluster operation (science), or for scalable deployment (container or server operation). Of course, there are all kinds of special tools available for this type of use cases, from OpenStack to Kubernetes. However, getting used to these monster programs is complicated and requires intensive training. For simple tasks, a few small scripts are often sufficient.The scripts in this chapter refer to the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for Linux and Microsoft Hyper-V for Windows virtualization systems.
Prerequisites for This Chapter
In addition to a basic knowledge of Bash or PowerShell, you’ll need a basic understanding of the relevant virtualization system and of the underlying network technology for this chapter.
One of the examples uses the cut, grep, and sed commands and applies regular expressions to modify network configuration files. I covered the related basic principles in
