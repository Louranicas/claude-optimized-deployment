12.1 Introduction
Significant usage of “artificial intelligence” (AI) (e.g., “machine learning” [ML]) cybersecurity (CS) [1, 2] is over “intrusion detection and prevention systems” (IDPSs) to constantly examine networks [3–6]. IDPSs [7] can spot likely incidents and their logging information, impeding incidents and conveying them to security administrators. The IDPS family hinges on ML examining network traffic and isolating anomalies to signpost potential intrusions. A paramount CS issue is that “human‐centered (HC) computing” (HCC) caters to the design, development, and setting out of mixed‐initiative HC systems. HCC usually deals with hardware (HW) and practices hinging on technology. Altogether, “human‐computer interaction” (HCI) relies more on usability and computing ergonomics than issues on studying and designing how people interrelate with “information and communication technologies” (ICT) like “cyber‐physical systems” (CPSs) [6]. ICT focuses on practices surrounding data collection, manipulation, and usage. The three computing “layers” are described below [3, 8–10].
Could Computing (CC): It handles business logic, “big data” (BD), analytical databases, and data “warehousing.” CC does not need to over‐provide assets up front to control business activity peak levels soon. Alternatively, one provisions the assets that one needs. One can scale these assets up or down to grow or shrink capacity as a business changes. CC delivers services over the Internet, e.g., storage, processing, and analytics. HCI positively impacts centralized data controlling with suitable data protection and BD workloads. This latter reason explains why it now has augmented popularity among companies. CC helps avail data centers to multiple customers with accredited access throughout the Internet.
Fog Computing (FC): It runs local network means, and micro‐data centers, amid other things. All the storage, computation, data, and applications stay between CC and the physical host in FC. All these functionalities work more toward the host with faster processing since it occurs almost where data are created. Popular FC usages embrace intelligent cities, smart grids, innovative constructions, vehicular networks, and “software (SW)‐defined networks” (SDNs). FC delivers low latency, while CC has high latency. CC collapses without the Internet. FC utilizes various protocols and standards to lessen failure risks. FC is more secure than CC owing to its distributed design. FC’s eight columns are scalability, security, hierarchy, openness, “reliability, availability, and serviceability” (RAS), autonomy, agility, and programmability. FC does not replace CC but supplements it by becoming more conceivable to the information source. An additional data processing design similar to FC, “mobile edge computing,” processes data straight on the devices without extra nodes or data centers, e.g., intermediary processing.
Multi‐access Edge Computing (Mobile Edge Computing or MEC, also Edge Computing [EC]): MEC engages in real‐time data processing on computers, mobile devices, wearables, info from sensors and actuators, process‐specific usages, and autonomous HW. MEC is near local customers and HW, extending CC to the network edge. MEC is the near‐real‐time BD processing produced via applications and edge devices closest to where evidence is captured – in other words, lengthening the edge of one’s network infrastructure. The two technologies differ as in MEC. The data processing occurs locally, while “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices refer data to the CC for analysis, being one of the most substantial differences between IoT Internet‐enabled gadgets for proper operation and edge devices that can be taken as part of the IoT once the item has plenty of storage and computing to make low‐latency decisions and process data fast enough.
“Deep learning” (DL) [11], ordinarily referred to as “deep neural networks” (DNNs), models a CPS with a structure having multiple layers that exploit the primary output as input from the uppermost level. From bottom to top, it remains an unsupervised learning process that autonomously discovers beneficial traits and expresses low‐level features as complex structures. Starting from top to bottom, this supervising learning process optimizes and adjusts the network as the whole’s parameters to boost its learning ability via labeled data to the complete network. DL has advanced swiftly because of both reasons below.

The application of tagged BD alleviates training issues. In DL, data serves as an “engine,” and Imagenet contains millions of annotated data; and
Rapid HW advancement lets the training of huge‐scale “neural networks” (NNs) with colossal computing potential, e.g., a high‐performance “graphical processor unit” (GPU) that can mingle thousands of cores [12–14].

DL is efficient for the most complex engineering tests. At the same time, HCC in FCs and MECs is a serious apprehension nowadays. Thus, developing DL‐based solutions is expected to be essential in cloud, fog, plus mobile edge networks (MENs) employing HCC [15–17], summarizing and sharing hi‐tech research and technological answers worldwide. This chapter sketches DL topics but is not circumscribed to Refs. [18–22]:
