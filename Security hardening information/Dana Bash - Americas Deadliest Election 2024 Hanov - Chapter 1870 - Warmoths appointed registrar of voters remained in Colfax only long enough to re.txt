Chapter: 1870 - Warmoth’s appointed registrar of voters remained in Colfax only long enough to register every Black voter in the parish, then began moving around, making it difficult for white voters to find him to register. To ensure the election of Warmoth’s “Radical” Republicans, he also supposedly added another two hundred fictitious Black voters, placed ballot boxes in places difficult for white voters to reach and finally took the unopened boxes with him to New Orleans before a count could be made.
As Louisiana prepared for the 1872 election, white voters in the parish were determined they would not be cheated again. But the Republican candidate for a seat in the state legislature was a widely respected Black leader, Captain William Ward.
Ward was a hero in Colfax. He had been among the first Black men enlisted in the Union Army. As a member of the First Colored Cavalry, he fought in the Virginia campaign, rising to become sergeant, the highest rank available to a Black soldier. Following the war, he had joined General Longstreet’s Louisiana State Militia and, after obtaining weapons, organized his own eighty-five-man militia to combat the growing threat of white supremacist organizations. To avenge the murder of a popular former sheriff, Ward thrilled Colfax by turning his company into a posse comitatus, capturing the killers and handing them over to New Orleans law enforcement.
Noting his growing popularity, in 1871 Governor Warmoth named him to the five-member parish “police jury,” the local governing board. But within months a small group of wealthy white supremacists led by cotton planter William Cruikshank forced him out of office, claiming he was ineligible because he had not been a resident of the parish for the required two consecutive years. Cruikshank took his place.
That action made Ward even more popular among freedmen, and more threatening to the white population.
The specter of an armed, well-trained Black militia terrified white residents of Grant Parish. Many of them had grown up hearing terrifying stories about the horrific 1791 rebellion that had ended slavery in Santo Domingo, which had served as justification for the brutal treatment of American slaves—and still was used by white politicians to scare out the vote.
William Ward was the embodiment of the fear that lived deep in the minds of many white people. During the 1872 campaign, Conservatives warned that Ward had promised freedmen that if Kellogg was elected they would be given the land on which they had once toiled as slaves. While the Republican media portrayed him as “fierce, resolute and bold...brave and determined, a good man,” Democratic papers wrote he had become “an absolute dictator,” overruling Calhoun, who had “sunk into utter insignificance.”
In the election Ward ran against Democrat James Hadnot, a plantation owner who possibly had been behind violent efforts to prevent Black citizens from voting in ’68. The difference between the two candidates could not have been starker: the white supremacist against the Black militant.
Throughout the campaign both sides ginned up fear to excite and motivate its voters.
Election day was peaceful, as it was throughout the state. The trouble began afterward. The Fusion press claimed the votes were counted in the courthouse under federal supervision, with its doors wide-open to allow interested observers to monitor the count. The Radical papers reported that white state officials had held the locked ballot box overnight—and when it was produced the next day it had a suspicious hole in its side.
Although there were about one hundred more registered Black voters than white in Grant Parish, according to the Warmoth Returning Board, Democrats had won a landslide victory. McEnery had beaten Kellogg, Hadnot had beaten Ward, Alphonse Cazabat had been elected parish judge, and Ku Kluxer Christopher Columbus Nash had been elected sheriff.
William Ward was especially angered by the decision. With more Black voters than white voters in the parish it seemed improbable he had been beaten—especially when the announced tally included several hundred fewer Black votes had been cast than in the previous election.
The Picayune informed readers that Ward admitted he had lost, supposedly telling Hadnot, “You have beaten me fairly, but I will represent the parish in the legislature, notwithstanding.” It was highly unlikely Ward would have said anything like this, especially to a Klan leader, but the story helped plant the idea that Radical Republicans intended to take illegal—and maybe violent—steps to seize control.
Colfax may have been more than three hundred miles from New Orleans, with a population of less than a few of that city’s blocks, but the potential consequences of an unsettled election there were just as grim. It was as true then and there as it had been through all recorded history: people will kill for power.
Before officially leaving the governor’s office, Warmoth issued the necessary legal commissions to Fusionist candidates Cazabat and Nash, who took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2.
Weeks later new governor Kellogg issued commissions to the same offices to the Republican candidates, appointing Robert Register to the parish bench and naming Daniel Shaw the new sheriff. Neither man could be sworn into office though, as C. C. Nash refused to surrender the keys to the courthouse.
Kellogg tried to keep the peace, and after meeting in New Orleans with Fusionist lawyers from Grant Parish he supposedly offered a compromise: he would agree to keep several of their people in local office—but not Sheriff Nash.
Nash or no one, Judge William Rutland and attorney Wilson Richardson warned.
Kellogg refused. It couldn’t be done. The lawyers stormed out of his office into perilous territory. Rutland was heard to say, “There would be hell in Grant Parish.”
The Colfax Courthouse was the center of power in Grant Parish. There was nothing glamorous about it. A one-story whitewashed building facing the Red River, it was a drab, functional brick structure that held both a courtroom and several administrative offices. What had once been the hayloft was now used for storage. There was an open crawl space below and a cypress-shingled roof above.
But the courthouse was just as important to Grant Parish as the Mechanics Institute was to New Orleans. It was the symbol of government. Nash was not going to give it up. As long as Fusionists held it he would remain sheriff.
Late in the night of March 25, several Republicans, led by Robert Register, broke into the courthouse through a side window and took possession. The next morning, before the Fusionists even knew about it, Dan Shaw and several other men were sworn into office. They immediately sent copies of their signed oath to New Orleans, where the forms were legally filed.
They had staged a quiet coup, taking control of local government and law enforcement.
Nash told the story quite differently. In his far more self-serving version, a body of men “ejected the legally elected...they fired upon myself and others, compelling us to flee for our lives.”
Even then, Nash said, he returned with law officers to find a peaceful solution, “but was again fired upon and threats made by the rioters who said they would anyhow drink my blood.”
The Fusionists were certain of one thing: this would not stand. The freedmen, the former slaves, would not be allowed to overturn the election. They spread the word: Meet at the courthouse on April 1. Bring your guns. The attack was supposed to remain secret, but Hadnot had bragged to one of his Black laborers that he was going to lynch William Ward and all the other men who got in his way.
When Ward learned about the plot to kill him, he called for reinforcements. Sheriff Shaw swore in enough men to form a large posse to defend the courthouse. They, too, were told: bring your guns.
Newspapers fed the flames, writing that one of Ward’s men had promised “he would have Hadnot’s head on a pole in twenty-four hours.”
Both sides had been preparing for this fight since the end of the Civil War. Reconstruction and the three new constitutional Amendments had drastically changed their worlds. The scars of history were too deep and still raw.
Once fear had been loosed, it grew. Wild rumors spread among the white population. Men would be killed. Women raped. In the days leading up to the confrontation, white residents of Colfax moved away, some of them claiming they were driven out, while hundreds of Black people from surrounding areas gathered inside the town, squeezing into the Smithfield Quarters or setting up campsites.
As armed men raced into the parish to reinforce both sides, several incidents took place to further inflame the situation. Among those who left town was Judge Rutland, who sent his family to safety across the river and then was given safe passage by Ward’s men. After he was gone they broke into his house; readers were told that the men “took from there a coffin in which his child was embalmed, thinking that it contained money...broke it open but finding out what it was, left the dead body of the child on the road.”
After escaping, Rutland filed a criminal complaint against the men who had ransacked his house. He included Ward, Register and Calhoun in his papers, obtaining a warrant for their arrest—which provided legal protection for a posse to carry it out.
Weeks later Rutland corrected the story, explaining the coffin actually contained the embalmed body of a young girl who had died six years earlier in Lake Charles, which he intended to reinter in Red River. He also said he had been told that the coffin had been burned.
Additional stories recounted in detail Ward’s posse ransacking other houses, shooting at people, stealing jewelry, “which the scoundrels sold for two bottles of whisky,” and boarding a steamer that landed there “armed with cutlasses, sabers, guns and pistols...and declaring there was going to be ‘hell to pay here tonight.’”
But Nash’s militia was equally violent. In the first days of April former slave Jesse McKinney was repairing a fence in front of his house about three miles out of town. A dozen riders suddenly appeared; their horses leaped the fence and without warning, in front of his wife and child, they shot him in the head. McKinney died several hours later—and any doubt in the Black community that it was under attack died with him. Hundreds more people took shelter in the town.
Ward’s men began constructing a defensive perimeter. Men were stationed on all the roads within twenty miles of Colfax to provide early warning. Shallow trenches were dug and earthen works no higher than three feet stretched in a rough semicircle around the front of the courthouse. The defenders had mostly shotguns and not nearly enough for all the men. They began stockpiling ammunition, a good portion of it homemade. They cut lengths of cast-iron stovepipe into makeshift cannons and positioned them above the main road.
Then they waited.
The Fusionists were also preparing, drilling the volunteers in units, scouting the preparations being made in town, stealing horses and mules from Black homesteads, and taking the four-inch deck cannon from a steamship and mounting it on a wagon.
There were some minor encounters. On April 1, nineteen men, led by Hadnot, made a display of force, racing through the town carrying rifles. A day later, a patrol led by Register encountered a scouting party near Smithfield Quarters. After a harmless exchange of fire, the scouts retreated. On April 5, Ward and several of his men encountered several white riders. They killed one of the horses and shot the thumb off a rider. The men fled, one of them later saying, “it seemed to me to be 4000 more coming our way.”
Meanwhile, outside of Grant Parish, few people knew what was brewing there. Or even if they had heard the stories, they dismissed them. A small article in the Republican warned that the Black “majority” in Grant Parish was prepared to “clean out” the white “minority...in twenty-four hours if not prevented.”
Another story, this one in the Picayune, about the ransacking of Judge Rutland’s house, claimed “Fearful Atrocities” had taken place, with “No Respect Shown to the Dead.” The Republican refuted it, writing there was no evidence anything other than the ousting of “McEnery pretenders to office” had taken place.
Too much was happening around the world for people to be concerned about rumblings from a small town. Instead, headlines focused on the wreck of the steamship Atlantic, which had run aground and tipped over less than one hundred yards off the coast of Nova Scotia. The Atlantic was the pride of England’s White Star company and was considered one of the most modern ships afloat. According to Associated Press reports, the ship was well off course and traveling at full speed when it smashed into shoals in the middle of the night. As many as seven hundred people drowned in their berths or were swept overboard in waves reaching as high as fifty feet, including every woman on board and every child but one, making it the largest passenger-ship disaster in history.
In Opelousas people were reading about anti-Semitism spreading in Texas. One legislator there objected to an effort to incorporate the Hebrew Association, admitting, “I do not much like Jews.” In response, B. R. Plumly stood and said, “I do like Jews... It is a foolish and cruel custom to deride the Jews...
“We do nearly everything that Christ condemned,” he pointed out, “and we leave undone almost everything that He required to be done.” His stirring defense of Hebrews continued, paying “tribute to the Jewish race, the tenacity of its life, the courage and endurance with which it met and mastered all conditions; its existence as a great people at a period so remote that what we call history is lost in tradition...having laws which have become the laws of the world, and permeated its civilization, gifts and activities felt even now in commerce, finance, musical and dramatic art, statesmanship, literature and eloquence...
“...I realize the feeling of Disraeli when, in the British Parliament, taunted with being a Jew, he is said to have replied, ‘I am a Jew. When the gentleman’s ancestors were naked savages on these islands, mine were princes of the temple...’”
In Evansville, Indiana, the Journal cautioned readers about the dangers of carrying concealed weapons, relating the sad tale of a young man whose revolver, hidden in his hip pocket, discharged accidently when he was visiting his beloved. The accidental shot set his pants on fire, which caused both his intended and her mother to faint. Her father, hearing the shot and seeing his wife and daughter on the floor, attacked the man, who crashed through a window to escape, pursued by the family dog. As the man ran for safety he fired at the dog, killing it, and ending forever his relationship.
But no one in Grant Parish had time to be concerned about the shipwreck, anti-Semitism in Texas or the tragic end of a comical encounter: each hour brought them closer to open warfare. Both sides sent word to New Orleans requesting assistance. If their messages ever reached Kellogg, he did not respond.
Several cursory attempts were made to reach a compromise. On April 5 leaders of both sides met in an open field to exchange peace proposals. But those negotiations ended when riders interrupted to tell Ward that Jesse McKinney had been murdered. Days later Willie Calhoun delivered letters suggesting a compromise to both sides, in an effort, he said, “to prevent bloodshed.”
Just before Easter, William Ward boarded a steamer headed downriver toward New Orleans, where he planned to do whatever was necessary to meet with Governor Kellogg to plead for federal intervention. Ward was a sick man, weakened by tuberculosis and rheumatism, but he knew that Kellogg was the only one who could stop Nash. Kellogg was already aware that violence was stirring in Grant Parish. But rather than riling things up by sending troops, he dispatched General Longstreet to go there and investigate. Longstreet had difficulty finding transportation; most of the boatmen refused to take him there, fearing the loss of business if they cooperated with the Republicans.
On April 13, Easter morning, Nash—in his role as the Fusion Sheriff—set out for Colfax with an estimated hundred and sixty-five well-armed men. He carried with him arrest warrants for the men who had destroyed Rutland’s home. Grant Parish’s representative in the people’s legislature, forty-nine-year-old James Hadnot, rode with him, the bright red sergeant’s sash and rosette medallion he had worn while serving in a Confederate reserve unit draped across his chest and carrying his war sword.
The posse crossed a stream and paused yards from the now-deserted Smithfield Quarters. Holding aloft a white flag, Nash and three men came forward. Lev Allen, leading the defense with Ward in New Orleans, rode out to meet them. Men on both sides readied their weapons. Their conversation was brief. “We want the courthouse,” Nash said, meaning he would take his place as the elected sheriff. If Allen’s men put down their arms they would be allowed to leave in peace.
Nash could not be trusted. Too many Black men had been attacked in the past months. McKinney had been fixing his fence when he was killed. If they put down their guns, Allen knew, they would be helpless. His people would stay right where they were, he replied—but boldly suggested that Nash’s men should leave their guns and take off before people got hurt.
Nash gave one final warning: You have thirty minutes to move your women and children to safety, he said.
After parting embraces, the women and children walked down the road, out of the line of fire, heading for a nearby plantation. Three white men had remained at the courthouse, among them Republican Sheriff Shaw, and they left the town with them, leaving only the Black freedmen.
As the Fusion forces took strategic positions around the courthouse, the defenders dug in behind the breastworks. An hour passed. The noon sun beat down hard on all of them. Two hours. Some men traded insults and threats. A sniper on the courthouse roof took several potshots at men playing seven-up for one dollar a hand; when one bullet missed by only a few feet, the cardplayers finally quit their game.

Some men traded insults and threats. A sniper on the courthouse roof took several potshots at men playing seven-up for one dollar a hand; when one bullet missed by only a few feet, the cardplayers finally quit their game.

The shooting began at two o’clock. Nineteen marksmen with Spencer and Sharps rifles, Smith and Wesson pistols and one Colt revolving rifle opened fire on the defenders. Those outgunned men crouched behind the breastworks, sporadically returning fire, trying to conserve ammunition. The attackers set up the wagon-mounted deck cannon in Willie Calhoun’s front yard, loaded it with trace chains, brickbats, rocks, canisters, milk cans filled with small deadly pellets known as “blue whistlers”—whatever they had—and began firing.
Shrapnel sliced open the abdomen of freedman Adam Kimball. As his intestines dripped out he was carried into the courthouse. The first man was dead. There would be so many more.
The thunder of the cannon, the shots flying, the tufts of dirt kicked up, the occasional screams of pain brought many of the men back a decade to the battlefields of the war.
The shooting continued through the afternoon. Several Black men were killed, but the defenders managed to hold out. Unable to make progress, Nash sent a few men down to the river to see if it was possible to outflank the men in front of the courthouse. His scouts moved quietly under the cover of the riverbank. Within minutes they came upon a gap in the unprotected levee behind the breastworks. It was a stunning discovery. It left the entire line of defense vulnerable.
Nash organized the attack. Thirty men crept into position. As the men in front of the defense began an assault, the river detachment raced through the gap and opened fire.
Outgunned, outflanked, outnumbered and outsmarted, the defenders left their dead and wounded in the trenches and abandoned their position. Dozens of them ran for the woods, many of them gunned down before they could get there. Some of them were captured, held briefly, then shot.
Lev Allen was among the few who managed to get into the woods and hide there. Other men made it to the river or a nearby pond—where they spent hours in the water, submerging themselves when the attackers came near.
Between thirty and forty men were taken prisoner.
About one hundred men, maybe more, reached the safety of the brick courthouse. They opened fire from the ten large windows. Nash’s three-man cannon crew moved their gun into position about eighty yards in front of the building. A shot from inside the courthouse nicked one of the crew, Stephen Decatur Parrish, in his leg, severing his femoral artery. The Picayune described his death thus: “The din of the battle were the last earthly sounds that fell upon the ear of as gallant a hero as ever glanced over a field of strife.”
What happened afterward was open to dispute, as the media reported events in a manner most favorable, and sympathetic, to their readers.
According to the Shreveport Times, at about three o’clock the gunfire from the courthouse slackened. Pieces of torn white cloth, signaling ceasefire, or perhaps surrender, popped out of several windows on the ends of rifles. The firing ended. After a few moments, a small group of white men, including James Hadnot and Sidney Harris, approached the courthouse.
“Mr. Harris and two other men were in front of Hadnot, and as the door was thrown open...they walked in,” the story continued. “Instantly a volley was fired upon Hadnot, and a door was closed upon Harris and his two companions and opened fire on them; that they were not literally torn to pieces is simply a miracle. They drew their six-shooters...and began firing. As Harris neared the door he was shot from the side, the ball entering his shoulder, and he fell against the door...the door swung open against his weight and he rolled out, and his companions jumped out...
“Mr. Hadnot received eleven buckshot in his leg and a ball through his stomach, from which he subsequently died... There was no possible way of dislodging the besieged...”
In fact, there was one way that would work: all reports agreed that the courthouse roof was set afire, though they disagreed about exactly how that was done. One version claimed a flaming arrow had started the blaze. An unnamed witness said a combustible material shot from the cannon caused the shingles to burst into flame. The Picayune would even write that the building had been set on fire by the men inside. The most detailed explanation was that Nash gave a captured elderly Black man, Pinckney Chambers, a choice: either set the courthouse on fire with a torch or be killed where he stood.
In that version a combustible material, either straw or cloth, was affixed to a long bamboo fishing pole, dipped in kerosene and lit. While sharpshooters kept the defenders away from the windows, “Pink” crept up to the courthouse and touched the makeshift torch to the eaves. The shingled roof caught instantly.
The order in which those two events took place, the shooting of Hadnot and the courthouse being set on fire, were disputed. Several survivors claimed that Harris and Hadnot were shot in the melee after the courthouse was burning, or that after being allowed to flee the fire Ward’s men produced guns and shot them. But no one denied what happened next.
As the now-unarmed defenders rushed out of the building the slaughter began. Nash’s men, irate at the shooting of Hadnot, opened fire from close range. They shot them down in the doorway or as they climbed through the windows. Wounded men were shot, stabbed with bowie knives or “pinned to the ground by bayonets.” Most of those who somehow got out of the courthouse were tracked down and shot. Bodies were found miles away. The New York Times, calling this “wholesale murder,” reported “one hundred of their number were shot as they fled.”
Several men, rather than being shot or burning to death, tore out floorboards and tried to take refuge in the crawl space or beneath a nearby warehouse. They died there.
That night forty or more prisoners were taken into the woods. Once again, the details are murky, but not the outcome. They were shot or hanged. Supposedly some of them were shot on the riverbank and fell into river. Others were lined up back-to-back, or three or four together, and shot in a quest to determine how many men could be killed with a single rifle bullet. Bill Cruikshank shot two men that way but Jim Hadnot’s son Luke lined up five men and killed them, although it required two shots.
No one was able to make an accurate count of the number of Black men killed that day, with estimates ranging from a hundred and fifty up to several hundred. It was agreed, though, that what was already beginning to be called the Colfax Massacre was the largest racial killing in American history.
Two white men were killed, and an unknown but small number were wounded.
A day later a hundred and twenty Metropolitan policemen landed in Colfax. They found sixty-five corpses on the ground, some of those remains still smoldering. Everywhere they looked they found more bodies. The police reported “The ground was thickly strewn with the dead.”
The papers spared none of the horrific details in describing the killing frenzy. The Republican cited the official report from Colonel T. W. DeKlyne to General Longstreet: “when forced by the fire to leave the courthouse they were shot down without mercy... Under the warehouse...were the bodies of six men who evidently crept under there for concealment and were there shot like dogs. Many were shot in the back of the head and neck; one man still lay with his hands clasped in supplication; the face of another man was completely flattened by blows from a gun, the broken stock a double-barreled shotgun being on the ground near him; another had been cut across the stomach with a knife after being shot and almost all had three to a dozen wounds. Many of them had their brains literally blown out...”
The massacre settled nothing. Ward and Nash had both escaped harm—Ward was safely in New Orleans when the fight began—and both men continued to claim the sheriff’s office. Governor Kellogg, meanwhile, did what was necessary for his own political survival: he blamed McEnery. He sent a letter to the state attorney general and a copy to the newspapers, in which he wrote the massacre in Grant Parish was “if not directly planned and ordered by this man [McEnery and his associates] [it] was the result of their treasonable acts against the State government.”
It was an extraordinary charge, based entirely on political calculation rather than fact. In his demand Kellogg pointed out that McEnery had broken the law by “openly referring to himself as Governor of the State...appointing people as public officers and in order to do so has forged the seal of the State.” Then, citing the attempted coup of March 5, he directed the attorney general to indict “McEnery and all others implicated with him, for treason.”
The penalty for treason was death by hanging. Making this accusation was a highly dramatic way of diverting attention and perhaps responsibility.
The massacre proved a new weapon to hammer home a political point. Even before all the bodies had been buried, the national media was assigning blame. The New York Sun knew whose fault it was: President Grant. The massacre was “a natural result of the lawlessness...encouraged by President Grant in order to give a member of his own family predominance...”
Fusionists placed the blame squarely with “the Kellogg–Casey [President Grant’s brother-in-law] party and the Administration,” which, the Picayune claimed, had encouraged Ward and others to take possession of offices to which they were not entitled.
Once again, Louisiana’s failed electoral system was on front pages throughout the country. As The Nation magazine wrote, this was what happened when confidence in that system was lost. “A state of things better fitted to produce explosions of violence...could hardly be imagined.”
The magazine placed at least some blame on “the disgraceful connivance at Washington at the state of things which has converted Louisiana into a South American banana republic and destroyed all confidence on the part of all classes, not only in the law, but in a popular vote which produces the law.”
As Warmoth had threatened weeks earlier, chaos had come to America.

The killing done, the law came to Colfax. It was a woefully belated effort to reassure people that the rules of a civilized society still applied, that good people were protected and criminals were punished. But by the time the police and the army got there, Nash’s men were long gone. Almost all the participants rode away, waiting to see what the legal outcome would be. Some went far, four hundred and fifty miles to Texas, where they settled, while others lived in the woods a short distance from their homesteads. Women in the area created a code, hanging different colored tablecloths to warn their men when lawmen were nearby.
The long, twisting legal pursuit of the killers, one that eventually would land in the United States Supreme Court and alter American history for a century, began on May 9, when federal prosecutor James Roswell Beckwith convened a grand jury. Because murder is a state crime, Beckwith had to bring charges under the federal government’s 1870 Enforcement Act, claiming the victims had been deprived of their constitutional rights. It was a complicated legal maneuver with no guarantee of success.
Beckwith was a northerner by birth, having been raised in Upstate New York, but had settled in cosmopolitan New Orleans with his wife, an author, to practice law. Grant had named him the federal prosecutor after the incumbent was found with his throat slit in his Custom House office.
Beckwith knew he was making himself a target: the Colfax killers had a lot of support in the white community and many people felt strongly that any man who prosecuted them was their enemy.
Especially a white man.
But Beckwith had been appalled at the reports from the town. These were atrocities, he wrote, they were barbaric, and he intended to prosecute every person involved. If America was to be a lawful nation, these men had to be punished.
Assisting him in his investigation was John J. Hoffman, an agent for the Treasury Department’s eight-year-old secret service. Posing as a traveling salesman, Hoffman had spent weeks listening in feigned amazement to stories from men who had been in Colfax. He provided evidence against dozens of them, in addition to finding survivors and white men brave enough to testify to the grand jury.
To simplify matters, Beckwith focused on only two victims: Alexander Tillman, who had been shot and killed a distance from the courthouse, and Levi Nelson, who had been taken prisoner and shot by Bill Cruikshank, who was attempting to prove that he could kill two men with one bullet. The indictment was a hundred and fifty handwritten pages long and included sixteen counts. It claimed that Nelson also had been killed—which was to cause the prosecution great embarrassment.
On June 17, a federal grand jury indicted ninety-eight men “of evil minds and dispositions.”
The State of Louisiana had an easier case to prove: under state law murder was murder. State prosecutor J. Ernest Breda took charge of the case. Like Beckwith, he willingly made himself the target. In early July, a grand jury met in the warehouse right next to the ruins of the Colfax courthouse and indicted a hundred and forty men. Although Breda tried to keep those indictments secret until the accused could be arrested, the news spread throughout the parish, and no arrests were made.
When Breda returned to Colfax several weeks later, an armed mob confronted him. Some of them, he knew, had taken part in the Easter morning slaughter. At least one shot was fired: it was enough to convince Breda to get out of town before sundown.



The Colfax Massacre became front-page news, shocking the nation.
The Historic New Orleans Collection, 1995.10.4


The violence that The Nation had warned about was spreading. According to President Grant, the Colfax Massacre’s “bloodthirstiness and barbarity is hardly surpassed by any facts of savage warfare” and demonstrated “a spirit of hatred and violence that is stronger than law.” Inspired by that attack, similar uprisings took place in St. Helena, Tangipahoa, Livingston and several other parishes. Kellogg sent small militia detachments to put an end to them. But by far the biggest and most dangerous resistance took place in St. Martinville.
The center of St. Martin Parish, St. Martinville was the stronghold of Alcibiades DeBlanc’s White Camelia organization. DeBlanc had established his own fiefdom: his six-hundred-man militia ransacked newspaper offices, threw Republican officials out of office and initiated a tax boycott. In essence, he had refused to accept the central government and instead set up his own.
The state was on the edge of open rebellion. DeBlanc had to be stopped. On May 3, Kellogg sent a hundred and twenty-five well-armed Metropolitans to St. Martinville to protect his appointed officials; they brought with them the twelve-pound Napoleon that had proved so effective in New Orleans. The men had no idea what was waiting for them there, but every one of them knew what had happened at Colfax and was ready for battle.
After the police had left New Orleans, gangs broke into several gun shops, stealing all the weapons and ammunition. “It is understood,” the New York Herald reported about the robberies, “a movement is on foot to seize the police stations while the Metropolitans are in the interior.”
That turned out to be false. But those weapons would prove very valuable in other coming conflicts.
It took the Metropolitans two days to get transportation to St. Martinville. DeBlanc’s men—who were variously referred to as “tax resisters,” “citizens” and “McEnery’s men”—had the town surrounded when they got there. The Metropolitans marched into St. Martinville without encountering any resistance. The telegraph lines were down, so little news leaked out. On the second day the police began their offensive, advancing about a mile and a half beyond the town, firing solid shot and shell, but in heavy fighting they were beaten back. It was reported that three officers had been killed and four wounded.
DeBlanc’s men had trapped them. Reinforcements for his “citizen” army poured into the area from the nearby parishes, while police reinforcements could not get transportation. The town was mostly deserted, all its stores closed. The police had arrested the mayor, charging him with treason. The court was open, presided over by the district attorney and judge appointed by Kellogg. It was a small gesture to demonstrate control. No lawyers showed up, so no business was done.
The whole country was watching with fascination. Reconstruction was falling apart. This seemed like the next deadly event after Colfax. “The Metropolitans are besieged at St. Martinville and cut off from water,” wrote the San Francisco Examiner. “Their provisions are with them, but otherwise they are in a desperate situation.”
There was little doubt who was really behind these insurgencies. As the Vermont Rutland Daily Globe explained, “There is enough to show that McEnery and Warmoth have seized upon the occasion to fan the smoldering fires of insubordination in the rebel heart, and to rouse their followers to frenzied deeds.”
To relieve the police, Kellogg organized the forty-five-man “Louisiana Cavalry,” consisting of both militia and Metropolitans, and told them to get to St. Martinville as quickly as possible. There was a general impression that these men were the more respected—and feared—federal rather than state troops, and nothing was done to dispel that deception.
Kellogg also formally requested assistance from federal troops. In response, two hundred infantrymen were ordered to the parish. A US Marshal went with them, carrying arrest warrants for DeBlanc and several other men, charging them with insurrection.
Transportation remained a problem. When the captain of the steamer Iberia refused to carry federal troops, he was arrested. A member of his crew removed the throttle valve from an engine and threw it in the river. Other crew members spent an entire day diving for it but, when it couldn’t be found, fashioned a new one.
In desperation, Kellogg purchased a steamship, the Ozark, but it took his men half a day’s march to meet that boat on the Bayou Teche.
By the time the troops got there the crisis was over. DeBlanc had ended the rebellion when he learned federal troops had been dispatched, admitting, “We did not intend or wish to come into conflict with federal authorities.” His men faded back into their normal lives. DeBlanc eventually surrendered to federal authorities and was brought back by steamer to New Orleans.
As many as seven thousand people were waiting on the wharf to greet him with a grand ovation, and many more lined his route to the Custom House. Contrary to reports, it turned out that no law enforcement officers had been killed and very few were wounded, so he was released on $2,000 bail—and within days all charges were dropped.
Rather than DeBlanc, it was Kellogg who came under attack. The Fusionist media was relentless: day after day the newspapers criticized him, reminding their readers he had lost the election and been illegally put in office by Grant, that he had turned the Metropolitan Police into his private army and that his tax policies were unduly harsh. Columns and editorials stoked anger. A failed attempt was made to indict him for sending New Orleans police officers to St. Martinville, leaving the city defenseless against criminals. Murder, rape and robberies supposedly were committed in places usually protected by police officers.
Even the New York Times noted, “It is known that assassination has been talked of in New Orleans, and men are known who have been asked to join an organization whose purpose it was to get rid of objectionable men in the community, beginning with the highest.”
So it was not surprising that an attempt was made on his life.
On May 7, while the governor was meeting with officials about a dispute on the docks earlier that day, a hostile crowd gathered around his waiting carriage. When Kellogg appeared, people began shouting insults at him. As he walked to his carriage a man named Charles R. Railey confronted him. “I wanted to tell you that you were a cowardly and usurping scoundrel and that if you have any courage you will stand like a man and I will treat you as the scoundrel you have shown yourself to be.”
Kellogg replied somewhat huffily, “I am not acquainted with you, and I don’t know that I have done anything to offend you, sir.”
As his carriage rounded the corner one shot rang out. Kellogg raised his hand to his neck as his driver raced them away. The story spread quickly: the governor had been shot and “was dangerously, if not fatally, wounded.”
For a brief time, it was not known how seriously he was hurt. Several men congratulated the lieutenant governor on suddenly becoming governor. The Herald reported Kellogg had been hit in his neck and gravely wounded. It turned out the bullet had missed him completely. He explained, “I heard a shot and simultaneously felt the passage of a shot by my neck. When the ball passed I involuntarily raised my hand...”
He added that Railey had threatened him during their brief encounter, warning him, “You are a dead scoundrel.”
The McEnery people showed little sympathy for him. The Picayune claimed he had taken refuge in the St. Charles Hotel, only to be told by its proprietor, Bob Rivers, “I’ll tell you what I would do if I were in your place, I would pack up my trunk and leave the city at once...
“...[D]on’t try to govern a people who hate you. You have escaped this time, but this is not the only attempt which is likely to be made upon your life, and perhaps you may not escape in the future.”
This also marked the beginning of a newspaper war, as the Republican’s editors wondered in print, “When an American newspaper enters the field as an...advocate of assassination and insidiously cites two or three historical examples to authorize such a crime, it is almost time for us to consider whether it would not be better for us to have a censor established for the press.”
Two days later, after learning a warrant had been issued for his arrest, Railey walked into a police station and surrendered. He denied having fired the shot, swearing, “I was as much surprised at the firing of the pistol as Mr. Kellogg could have been.” He was released on a $5,000 bond.
Picayune reporter Melvin M. Cohen also was arrested—and charged with actually firing the shot.
Few people gained more from the continuing chaos than New Orleans’s lawyers. There were more than one hundred active law firms in the city, and the incredible number of cases resulting from the disarray kept many of them busy—and wealthy. The number of significant legal and constitutional issues spawned by the contested election was astonishing. In some ways it eventually would affect the interpretation of numerous Amendments. While this assassination trial was beginning, for example, a First Amendment libel case against the Picayune was concluding. It had been brought by Judge Jacob Hawkins, a member of the Lynch Returning Board who sued the paper after it reported that he had been paid a substantial sum and appointed to a newly created court in return for his support of Kellogg.
Describing the case as “A Lawless Attempt to Destroy the Freedom of the Press,” The New York Sun suggested that “for the conduct of the trial, perhaps no such case has ever occurred in the history of the legal courts of the country.” The case was tried in the court of...Judge Lynch. And among the witnesses for the defense was Henry Warmoth.
Somewhat surprisingly, this civil trial attracted as much attention in the city as a case involving blood or lust. As the attorney for the Picayune, H. N. Ogden said the outcome of this case would affect every newspaper in the country. “If this jury fails to do its duty at this critical moment, the result will be not only the suppression of the New Orleans Picayune...it will be a large stride toward the suppression of all freedom of speech or thought throughout the country...
“Whenever the attempt has been made to destroy liberty and establish despotism, the very first assault is always made upon the freedom of the press...so as to keep the public from that knowledge which is essential to the proper...protection of liberty.”
The courtroom was so densely packed with spectators and other attorneys that in the middle of the first day’s proceedings the floor started shaking. Someone yelled, “There are too many people in the room. The floor is sinking.” Spectators began rushing to the door. A few of them went to the windows. But within a few minutes order was restored, and the courtroom was quickly and safely evacuated.
Just as the last people left the room a large piece of plaster above the judge’s desk came crashing down.
The trial was moved into the larger, more secure Supreme Court room. It lasted six days. When the jury pleaded it was unable to reach a verdict, Judge Lynch refused to dismiss them, insisting in harsh tones that they continue deliberating, and warning they would not be released until they agreed—no matter how long that took. After almost three days of deliberations, they found the paper guilty, and it was fined $18,000—but when the two Democrat members of the jury claimed they had been offered a large bribe to join the majority, the lawyers went back to work.
No sooner was that controversial trial ended than the Railey–Cohen trial began. With feelings on edge in New Orleans, the district attorney asked for and was granted a change of venue. The trial was moved about thirty miles to Jefferson Parish. It began on June 23, with a jury comprised of ten Radical Republicans and two Fusionists. A company of mounted Metropolitans stood guard around the courthouse. Governor Kellogg was the opening witness. On the day of the shooting, he testified, he was a bit apprehensive when he saw the crowd gathered around his carriage. “It flashed upon me that there was a preconcerted attempt to surround me; I had been warned that I might be attacked... I heard reports that there were secret societies for the assassination of prominent Republicans.”
He identified Railey as the man who had confronted him but admitted he had not seen who fired the shot. Cohen was asked to stand, but Kellogg could not identify him.
Prosecutors revealed that hours after the assassination attempt a mysterious gold key inscribed with the governor’s initials was delivered to his home—supposedly, the prosecution hinted, by one of the defendants!
The jury was sequestered in a locked room each night during the trial. A prosecution eyewitness positively identified Cohen as the shooter, but several defense witnesses provided alibis for him. Another eyewitness told the jury that he had seen Cohen immediately after the shooting—walking in the crowd holding a pad and pencil!
The mysterious inscribed gold key was never further explained.
The jury deliberated for less than two hours before finding both defendants not guilty. No one else was ever charged with the crime.
Kellogg tried to fight the Fusionists with words. Days after the attempted assassination he published a long statement in the Republican in which he laid out the situation and asked for cooperation if not understanding. Whatever views people held, he wrote “all must admit it is the only government in the state and must remain so, at least until the national authority shall determine otherwise. Upon myself, therefore...falls the responsibility of sustaining it in the interests of public order and for the prevention of anarchy.” If he failed to do that, he continued, the same people who were fomenting the violence would blame him for not stopping that violence they were fomenting.
On several occasions he had been dissuaded from asking the president for federal troops. But the situation was already beyond his control. So he finally made an official request.
Grant had been reluctant to get involved; there was no political gain for him. But Colfax, St. Martinville and several other smaller uprisings had emboldened those people opposed to his Reconstruction policies. The white supremacist organizations were growing. He had waited several months, hoping that Congress would present a plan he could support. Congress was continuing to investigate; it was holding hearings, then holding more hearings, then issuing statements about those hearings. He had to do something to try to calm the situation.
On May 22, the president finally issued a statement supporting Kellogg. It was meant as a warning: “Whereas, under the pretense that William P. Kellogg, the present executive of Louisiana, and the officers associated with him in the State administration, were not duly elected, certain turbulent and disorderly persons have combined together with force and arms to resist the laws and constituted authorities of the State...”
The statement continued, claiming Congress had tacitly recognized Kellogg as the legally elected governor by refusing to take any action to remove him, and that as president he was obligated to protect the citizens of every state and had the right to use military forces to put down any insurgency, therefore...
He wasn’t actually going to do anything, instead he was commanding “said turbulent and disorderly persons to disperse and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty days...”
The response was exactly as expected. Grant’s proclamation was “infinitely absurd,” decided the Fusionist Picayune. With peace now in Colfax and St. Martinville, “There is not a single creature in Louisiana to whom the Proclamation has any application.”
The statement has little meaning, The New York Sun pointed out. “It is out of the rival claims of Kellogg and McEnery to the Governorship that the novelty of this very serious controversy arises, and that the so-called domestic violence in Louisiana springs solely from this source.” And settling that “is the first duty of the President.”
McEnery, calling himself “the duly elected but deposed Governor,” continued to hold out hope for Congressional action. But he was a realist, reminding his supporters “the President of the United States, with the army and navy at his command, has the physical power to coerce the people of this State into any line of policy he may be pleased to dictate, and it would be but folly and madness to interpose any resistance.”
Until Congress met again in December when, he was certain, they would recognize his government, he urged that “peace and order may reign supreme...”
Throughout the summer both state and federal law enforcement supposedly searched—without much success—for the nearly one hundred men indicted for the Colfax Massacre. No more than ten people were arrested. Their names were not released, and they were held in the secure prison in New Orleans.
When Judge Register, whose claim to the bench helped ignite the killings, attempted to hold a hearing in Grant Parish in late July, sixty or seventy people showed up and made that impossible. Threats on his life were made.
The violence slowed, but it did not end. On September 8, Judge T. S. Crawford and District Attorney Arthur Harris were on their way to hold court in Winnsboro in Franklin Parish when they were ambushed and killed. The evidence indicated that they had been shot from both sides of the road. This wasn’t an attempted robbery, this was a planned assassination. Crawford’s body was so badly mutilated that “the number of shots he received was impossible to determine;” Harris was shot in the back of the head.
Law enforcement immediately accused the Tom Winn gang. Winn had been tried and convicted of murder by Judge Crawford, and Harris had been prosecutor. Winn had vowed to get even and escaped from prison. But the judge was a Kellogg Republican, and rather than being outraged by the murder of a law enforcement official, some Democrats made it clear they believed he shouldn’t have been on the bench.
The reaction so startled—and perhaps terrified—Sheriff Dan Shaw that he resigned, writing Kellogg that he was “powerless to do my duty.”
Nevertheless, Kellogg posted a $5,000 reward for the capture of the murderers. The inability to capture the leaders of the Colfax Massacre continued to embarrass Grant and Kellogg. Grant, who was considering running for a third term, needed the Black vote—and that meant he had to bring some of those killers to justice. On October 23, heavily armed state militiamen, supported by several infantrymen, boarded the Ozark and steamed toward Colfax. They had no idea what type of resistance they might encounter. Just in case, they brought two pieces of artillery with them.
The hunt for the killers was beginning.
G. W. Hadnot’s farm was the first stop. The law came riding hard and fast. Hadnot saw them coming and slipped out the back door into the woods, making good his escape. But he had no chance to spread a warning. A mile up the road his brother was arrested. The posse surprised Bill Cruikshank, who was just sitting on his porch. The troops had information that more than two hundred men were camped in the piney woods, “the rendezvous for all who did not care for being in their homes while the Ozark remained in this neighborhood.” Skirmishers crawled through the deep grass, trying to surprise the camp. But it was deserted. While the posse was searching the Cruikshank place, those men had been warned and took off for Catahoula Lake.
Law enforcement chased them for twenty-five miles before finally catching up to them. But there wasn’t a single man among them for whom they had a warrant.
The big prize was Christopher Nash. The posse got a tip that he had made camp north of Colfax on the east bank of the Red River. They hightailed it after him. Nash heard them coming and made good his getaway, racing across the river, outrunning their bullets. His narrow escape made him into an even greater local hero: the story was told that when he reached the west bank he turned and saluted his pursuers with a grand wave of his hat, then disappeared into the woods.
The militia roamed through the area for three weeks. They rode from parish to parish, making raids day and night, but as a reporter embedded with them wrote, “as the news of our approach had been heralded by the underground telegraph, the men for whom warrants were held had fled, seeking hiding places in which militia, police or soldiers cannot find them. The village is a dull place, not a murder within a week. The lively men had gone where the woodbine twineth in solitude.”
After the law had left, the white supremacists returned in several towns and punished people who had provided information to the troops.
The Ozark returned to New Orleans with less than a dozen prisoners.
Those men were locked up in a single large cell in the Orleans Parish prison. As they were being taken to jail they had an opportunity to speak with reporters. They were innocent, all of them, they insisted. Bill Cruikshank said he had been scared off his farm two weeks before the massacre, “when thirteen armed n——s, who in passing by my residence threatened to shoot with buckshot my four children.” The next day he moved his family to Alexandria “until affairs quieted down in Colfax.” When he learned his storehouse had been broken into and five barrels of pork had been stolen, he obtained arrest warrants and, “I went to the proper authorities...both the Kellogg and McEnery sheriffs [both acting at the same time...]. The Kellogg sheriff refused to serve on the grounds it was a trick to get him in a scrap, and the McEnery sheriff endeavored to summon a posse to go but did not succeed.” He had not been near Colfax for thirteen months, he said.
Johnnie Hadnot claimed he had taken his family and left home days earlier, after being shown a note that William Ward had put a $250 reward on his uncle James’s head.
Prudhomme LeMoine recalled, “On the day of the fight I was at the Catholic church at Cloutierville.” And, he added, he had witnesses who had seen him there.
In fact, each of the accused said they could produce numerous witnesses to support their alibi, whatever that alibi happened to be.
The “Grant Parish prisoners” quickly became heroes. They were hailed as good, decent Southern boys, sons of the Confederacy, standing up for what they believed was right. Every movement needs symbols around which people can rally. The Colfax prisoners became that rallying point. One of New Orleans’s most prominent lawyers, Robert Marr, volunteered to defend them. He was the perfect man for the task: a white supremacist, Marr had recently formed a committee of seventy wealthy and successful people to support McEnery. For Marr, this trial was an opportunity to gain attention, sympathy and legal standing for the white citizens whose rights, he believed, had been trampled on by the Reconstruction Acts. Other respected lawyers, among them carpetbagger turned white supremacist William Whitaker, who had served as legal counsel to Warmoth’s voter registration effort, joined him.
Although the lawyers volunteered their services, money would be needed to fight for their prisoners’ freedom. A lot of money. There were legal expenses. Witnesses would have to be transported and housed while in the city for the trial. The prisoners and their families would need assistance. The Committee of Seventy launched a fundraising campaign to support the men. “There has not been, in the history of Radical oppression in Louisiana, a more flagrant instance than that...it should be at least our pleasure to mitigate the sufferings of the unfortunate men...”
In the ensuing months thousands of dollars were raised. A performance of Frederick Schiller’s The Robbers by the Orleans Dramatic Association raised $1,
