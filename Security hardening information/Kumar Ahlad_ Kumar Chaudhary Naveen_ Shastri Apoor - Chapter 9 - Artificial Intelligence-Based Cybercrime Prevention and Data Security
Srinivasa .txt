9.1 Introduction
When referring to unlawful activities carried out over digital networks, the word “cybercrime” is often used to refer to the internet. Malware, phishing, and hacking are all examples of methods that fall under the umbrella of cybercrime, which is a broad category of criminal activity that includes a wide range of offenses. In order to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, malicious software is used throughout the process. Attempting to get sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy organization is an example of phishing, which is a fraudulent practice. The use of cyber tools to carry out terrorist acts, particularly assaults on key infrastructure, is what is meant by the term “cyberterrorism.” Identity theft, cyberstalking and harassment, online fraud and scams, theft of intellectual property, denial-of-service attacks, and theft of intellectual property are some of the other kinds of cybercrime. Businesses have the potential to gain money by stealing the personal information of other people. The fact that cybercrime hinders commerce via assaults such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware, as well as the fact that it costs people, organizations, and governments money, is a negative aspect (Rukavitsyn et al., 2017).
It also has severe personal impacts, such as identity theft causing financial losses and emotional distress, and privacy violations exposing sensitive information to misuse. Security threats include targeting national infrastructure and corporate espionage, undermining national security and economic stability. Social impacts are seen in the spread of misinformation influencing public opinion and cyberbullying causing psychological harm. Technological advancements, like the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and artificial intelligence (AI) exploitation, introduce new vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack methods. Mitigating these threats requires enhanced cybersecurity measures, updated legislation and regulation, increased awareness and education, and well-developed incident response plans. In summary, cybercrime poses significant and multifaceted threats in the modern digital age, affecting economic stability, personal security, and national safety, necessitating proactive measures in cybersecurity, legislation, and public awareness to combat and mitigate these evolving threats (Ugale et al., 2011).


9.2 Cybercrime Historical Perspective
Cybercrime, the use of technology to commit crimes or harm others, has evolved significantly over the past few decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, early computer misuse in academic and military settings and phone phreaking marked the beginning of technological exploitation. The 1980s saw the rise of personal computers and hacking culture, leading to legislative responses such as the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, highlighted by notable cases like the “414s” hackers. The 1990s, characterized by widespread internet adoption, saw the emergence of cybercrime syndicates exploiting the internet for financial gain, with incidents like the 1994 arrest of Russian hacker Vladimir Levin. The 2000s brought more sophisticated cyberattacks, targeting government and corporate entities, prompting stronger laws and international cooperation, exemplified by the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime. The 2010s experienced major data breaches and cyberwarfare, including the Stuxnet worm and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, along with a ransomware epidemic. In the 2020s, advanced technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain have introduced new vulnerabilities, with the COVID-19 pandemic further accelerating cybercrime. As cyber threats continue to evolve, ongoing efforts in cybersecurity, legislation, and international cooperation remain essential to protect against emerging threats (Deebak & Al-Turjman, 2021).
