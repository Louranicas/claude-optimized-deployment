Chapter: 1 - , you learned how to use the ls command to obtain information about files in a given directory. You can view the number of lines, words, and characters in a set of files using the wc command. For example, if you execute the command wc * in a command shell you will see information for all the files in a directory, similar to the following output:
3      6       25 apple-care.txt
12     28     146 checkin-commands.txt
27     55     478 iphonemeetup.txt
 2      1      12 kyrgyzstan.txt
 1      2      11 outfile.txt
 2      2      12 output.txt
 5     11     176 ssl-instructions.txt
52    105     860 total
As you can see from the last line in the previous output, there are a total of 52 lines, 105 words, and 860 characters in the text files in this directory. If you run the command “wc o*” you will see information about files that start with the letter o, as shown here:
1      2      11 outfile.txt
2      2      12 output.txt
3      4      23 total
You can count the number of files in a directory with ls -1 |wc as shown here:
7      7      112
The shell commands cat, more, less, head, and tail display different parts of a file. For short files, these commands can overlap in terms of their output. The next several sections provide more details about these commands, along with some examples.
THE CAT COMMAND
The cat command displays the entire contents of a file, which is convenient for small files. For longer files, you can use the more command that enables you to “page” through the contents of a file.
If you type this command:
cat iphonemeetup.txt
you will see the following output:
iPhone meetup

* iui.googlecode.com

You can see size-related attributes with the command wc iphonemeetup.txt:
21     48     417 iphonemeetup.txt
THE MORE COMMAND AND THE LESS COMMAND
The more command enables you to view “pages” of content in a file. Press the space bar to advance to the next page, and press the return key to advance a single line. The less command is similar to the more command. An example of the more command is here:
more abc.txt
Alternatively, you can use this form, but remember that it’s less efficient because two processes are involved:
cat abc.txt |more
The more command contains some useful options. For instance, if you want the more command to start from the 15th line in a file instead of the first line, use this command:
more +15 abc.txt
If a file contains multiple consecutive blank lines, you can remove them from the output with this command:
more -s abc.txt
Search for the pattern abc in a text file via the following command:
more +/abc.txt
THE HEAD COMMAND
The head command enables you to display an initial set of lines, and the default number is
