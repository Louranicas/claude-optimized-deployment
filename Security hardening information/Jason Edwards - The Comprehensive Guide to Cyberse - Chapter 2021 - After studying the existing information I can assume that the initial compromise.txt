Chapter: 2021 - After studying the existing information, I can assume that the initial compromise may have occurred through phishing emails or other social engineering techniques, though specific details about the entry point remain unclear. Once inside the JBS network, the attackers deployed the REvil ransomware, which encrypted critical systems and data, halting operations across the company’s processing plants in the United States, Australia, and Canada.
The attack timeline shows that within hours of detecting the ransomware, JBS decided to shut down its IT systems to contain the spread of the malware. The shutdown led to widespread disruption in meat production, as the company’s facilities rely heavily on digital systems for managing processing operations, supply chains, and logistics. Beef processing plants in the United States, particularly in states such as Colorado, Texas, and Nebraska, were significantly affected, with production grinding to a halt.
JBS quickly notified federal authorities, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the FBI, to assist in the response and investigation. The company also engaged external cybersecurity firms to help assess the situation and develop a strategy for restoring operations. Meanwhile, news of the attack spread rapidly, raising concerns about potential food shortages and price increases.
Detection and Response Efforts
JBS detected the ransomware attack early in the infection process, allowing them to respond swiftly. By taking their systems offline, JBS prevented the ransomware from spreading further and compromising more critical data. The company worked with cybersecurity firms to investigate the breach, assess the damage, and begin recovery efforts. However, despite these efforts, the disruption to production lasted several days, leading to significant operational challenges.
The FBI and other law enforcement agencies in the United States and Australia were involved in the response and investigation. These agencies collaborated with JBS to identify the perpetrators and explore possible avenues for mitigating the attack’s impact. The REvil ransomware group, a well-known cybercriminal organization with a history of targeting large companies, was quickly identified as the responsible party.
Despite efforts to recover encrypted data, JBS ultimately paid the ransom demand of 11 million dollars in Bitcoin. The company’s CEO later stated that the payment was made to protect its plants, employees, and customers from further disruption. This decision was controversial, as paying ransoms can encourage further attacks, but JBS prioritized restoring operations to avoid more severe consequences for the food supply chain.
Assessing the Impact
The immediate impact of the JBS ransomware attack was significant, with widespread disruptions to meat production in the United States, Australia, and Canada. The shutdown of processing plants caused a temporary halt in meat deliveries, leading to concerns about shortages and potential price increases. In the United States, the shutdown affected roughly 20–25 percent of the country’s beef production, and while the disruption lasted only a few days, the ripple effects were felt across the supply chain.
Financially, the attack cost JBS millions in lost revenue along with the 11-million-dollar ransom payment. The company also faced reputational damage as questions arose about its cybersecurity practices and preparedness. For the food industry, the attack underscored the vulnerabilities in the supply chain and the need for stronger cybersecurity defenses.
The attack prompted increased scrutiny of the food and agriculture sector’s cybersecurity practices in the long term. Governments in the United States and Australia began discussions about improving the resilience of critical infrastructure, focusing on industries like food production, energy, and healthcare. The attack also increased companies’ awareness of the importance of robust incident response plans and regularly updated security measures to defend against ransomware.
Lessons Learned and Takeaways
The JBS ransomware attack highlighted several important lessons for the food industry and the broader cybersecurity community. First, the attack demonstrated the importance of having a comprehensive incident response plan. JBS’s quick shutting down of its systems prevented the ransomware from spreading further, but the company’s reliance on paying the ransom revealed gaps in its preparedness for such an attack. Moving forward, companies must develop robust recovery strategies that minimize the need to engage with cybercriminals.
Second, the attack underscored the vulnerability of critical infrastructure industries to ransomware. Like many other essential services, food production relies heavily on digital systems that, if compromised, can have wide-reaching consequences. The JBS attack highlighted the need for stronger defenses in sectors vital to national and global supply chains.
Finally, the attack demonstrated the importance of government and industry collaboration in responding to ransomware. The involvement of federal agencies like the FBI and USDA played a key role in mitigating the attack and assisting with recovery efforts. Public-private partnerships will strengthen defenses against future cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.

Case Study Summary
The JBS ransomware attack in 2021 was a significant cyber incident that disrupted one of the largest food production companies in the world. The attack, carried out by the REvil ransomware group, halted meat production in the United States, Australia, and Canada, causing temporary disruptions to the global food supply chain. JBS’s decision to pay an 11-million-dollar ransom to restore its operations highlighted the challenges companies have when dealing with ransomware attacks.
Key takeaways from this case include the importance of having a comprehensive incident response plan, the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure industries to cyberattacks, and the need for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors in responding to and preventing future ransomware incidents. The JBS attack serves as a reminder that even industries not traditionally seen as targets of cyberattacks must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts.

REVIL RANSOMWARE ATTACK ON KASEYA (2021)
The REvil ransomware attack on Kaseya in July 2021 was a sophisticated and large-scale supply chain attack that demonstrated how cybercriminals could exploit IT management software vulnerabilities to amplify an attack’s scope. Kaseya, a U.S.-based IT and network management solutions provider, was targeted by the notorious REvil ransomware group, which compromised its VSA (virtual system administrator) software to deploy ransomware to hundreds of organizations worldwide. The attack was especially devastating because Kaseya’s clients included managed service providers (MSPs), whose own customers—thousands of small and medium-sized businesses—were indirectly affected.
At the time, the global cybersecurity environment was facing increasing threats from ransomware, with the Kaseya attack coming just weeks after the high-profile ransomware incidents involving Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods. This attack, however, stood out due to the attackers’ method of leveraging a single software provider to compromise numerous downstream customers. The attackers demanded a 70-million-dollar ransom in exchange for a universal decryption key, making it one of the largest ransomware demands in history.
Key stakeholders in the attack included Kaseya, its MSP clients, the affected downstream businesses, government agencies, and cybersecurity firms. The attack raised serious concerns about the security of supply chains and the vulnerability of IT service providers to sophisticated cyberattacks.
Unfolding the Attack
The REvil ransomware attack began over the July 4th holiday weekend in the United States, when many businesses had reduced staffing and were, therefore, less likely to notice or respond quickly to the breach. The available information assumes that the attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Kaseya’s VSA software to gain unauthorized access. This allowed them to deploy ransomware to Kaseya’s clients—primarily MSPs—who unknowingly pushed the malicious software to their customers.
The timeline of the attack indicates that Kaseya first detected suspicious activity on July 2,
