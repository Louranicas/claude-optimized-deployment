ticated threats. In this chapter, we discuss how AI technologies, including machine 
learning and behavioral analysis, can be used for detecting anomalies, predicting 
threats, and responding to incidents in real time. This chapter thus emphasizes AI’s 
potential to enhance the resilience of ICS/OT ecosystems by leveraging AI-driven 
anomaly detection and adaptive security measures. In addition, it discusses the 
practical implications, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing AI solutions 
to safeguard critical infrastructure from evolving cyber risks.
