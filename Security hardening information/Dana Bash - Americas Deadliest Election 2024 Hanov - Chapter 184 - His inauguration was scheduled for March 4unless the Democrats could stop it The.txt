Chapter: 184 - His inauguration was scheduled for March 4—unless the Democrats could stop it. They did everything possible. They forced debate on every issue, fighting for time. House Obstructionists, as they were referred to, announced a filibuster would begin. A Democrat senator was quoted in a New York paper “in a violent appeal,” warning “he was to stop the progress of the count by any means in his power.” Supposedly a hundred thousand men were preparing to descend on the Capitol to prevent the inauguration of the man they called “Rutherfraud” or “His Fraudulency.”
Given the twists and turns so far, it seemed hard to imagine that something even more unexpected could take place. But in Louisiana there was always another surprise coming. This time, an attempt was made to assassinate Governor Packard.
On the morning of February 15, as the Electoral Commission was hearing witnesses in Washington and two governors with two legislatures were trying to conduct business in New Orleans, Governor Packard was working in his office at the St. Louis Hotel. Several other people were in the room with him.
A neatly dressed, handsome young man later identified as William Weldon had been drinking at the Ville de Luxembourg with a one-armed man and a one-legged man. Weldon announced he needed to see Packard and convinced the one-armed man to accompany him. It was reported he locked his arm in the other man’s stump, and they walked the few blocks to Packard’s office. When they reached the hotel Weldon presented a card identifying himself as Frank Hudson, correspondent for the Philadelphia Press, and was admitted.
Weldon took a seat several feet behind the governor. After patiently waiting a few minutes he pulled a revolver and said loudly, “Governor, how long do I have to wait to see you?” Packard turned—and saw the muzzle pointed directly at his head. He responded instantly. In one swift movement he pushed the gun away with his left hand and slugged the would-be assassin with his right. Some witnesses swore Weldon pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired; then he fired again, and this time the gun boomed.
Packard’s punch knocked down Weldon. In the melee several men drew their pistols. Police Superintendent W. F. Loan fired one shot at the assailant. Packard reportedly stepped in front of Weldon, saving his life. Then the governor was hustled out of the room to a safer upper floor.
Packard was fortunate: Weldon’s bullet had barely grazed his right leg. Loan’s shot smashed into Weldon’s left arm; he bled profusely. For a brief time, it appeared the wound was fatal. But Weldon was equally lucky and survived without serious damage.
“The most notorious man in the nation,” according to the New York Times, the twenty-five-year-old Weldon was described as a clerk at Pepper’s dry goods store in Mobile, Alabama. The paper suggested this attempt was part of a larger plot, reporting that Louisiana Democrats had advocated Packard’s assassination “as a means of ridding the state of Republicans distasteful to the White League community.” The doctor who bound Weldon’s wound believed he was under the influence of opium and alcohol and was carrying a bottle of absinthe. He had intended to kill both Hayes and Packard, he admitted, “to save the country.”
Not surprisingly, the Times-Picayune quoted him as saying, “I am a Republican,” while the New Orleans Republican reported he told police he was a Democrat.
When informed Packard had saved his life he said, “Tell him I want to see him.”
Weldon was charged with crimes that would have locked him away for decades. Instead, his father, a Lutheran minister, came to New Orleans and appealed personally to Packard. Other character witnesses sent letters. Packard agreed to release the young man on $5,000 bond and allow him to leave the state. When a grand jury met to consider an indictment, no one appeared to testify, and the case was dismissed.
By that time Louisiana’s new governor had taken office. Incredibly, it was Francis Nicholls.
It had taken an astonishing turn of events to reach that resolution following a historic conference that never officially took place.
Democrats had refused to accept the electoral college result from Washington. One man was not going to name the president. Republicans knew the outcome hadn’t been fair. Hayes supporter Mark Twain admitted, “Even with the disputed states counted as Republican, Tilden had a plurality of 250,000 votes over Hayes. There is no longer any doubt that this election was stolen.”
The problem was how to deal with it. Democrats would do whatever was necessary to prevent Hayes from being inaugurated. Several members of Congress floated the idea of a new election, calling it “a peaceful appeal to the ballot.” But the lessons of Liberty Place had not been forgotten. This was no longer a political conflict. Guns ruled the streets. In Columbus, Ohio, shots were fired into Hayes’s home as his family was enjoying dinner. In New Orleans, even after surviving Weldon’s attempt on his life, Packard was warned “that an attack would be made upon the fort,” meaning his headquarters in the St. Louis Hotel, and the mercenaries were “fully equipped with death-dealing Winchesters,” awaiting “only a slight touch to make it explode...” The governor repeatedly pleaded with Grant for fifteen hundred men, claiming he needed that many troops to maintain Republican control of the state.
Nicholls tried to restrain White League troops, fearing an attack would give Grant the excuse he needed to send the army. It was uncertain if Nicholls would be able to prevent them from taking action against Packard.
During the waning days of February, in a last-minute effort to prevent a violent confrontation, party leaders met secretly at Wormley House in northwest Washington, DC. The prestigious hotel and restaurant had been developed by Black businessman James Wormley; it was a popular meeting place for powerful political leaders, celebrities, wealthy executives and military officers.
Representatives of Hayes and Tilden tried to work out a deal to give both parties what they needed to prevent bloodshed. No records were kept of the meeting, no notes were made, there were few discussions with reporters. The people attending the meeting had no legal status, no one had appointed them or given them any direction. They had no official power to make or enforce any agreement.
But they negotiated as if they did. Democrats agreed to end their filibuster and concede the election to Hayes in return for his pledge to withdraw all remaining federal troops from the South, share patronage, appoint at least one Southern Democrat to his cabinet and support substantial appropriations for railroad construction and other projects. Democrats also agreed to guarantee equal rights and safety for all citizens.
The deal was simple: the presidency in exchange for the end of Reconstruction.
It carried a high price, effectively eliminating federal protection for Black rights in the South. No one ever publicly admitted that, but as details leaked it became obvious.
Neither Hayes nor Tilden ever acknowledged this agreement. Hayes later pledged to restore “wise, honest and peaceful local self-government” to the Southern states. Tilden, who believed his options were limited to accepting this agreement or watching the outbreak of a second civil war, said, “I can retire to public life with the consciousness that I shall receive from posterity the credit of having been elected to the highest position in the gift of the people, without any of the cares or responsibilities.”
Few newspapers carried any reports of this meeting, and even those papers that hinted at it provided few details. No one knew for certain that there was a “Wormley Compromise” or “Bargain of 1877.” But something had changed; it was as if a derailed train had been put back on the tracks and suddenly there was forward movement.
Still there was no unanimous agreement. A large group of Democratic holdouts in Congress was determined Hayes would not be anointed president, while a large group of Republicans held out against handing the South over to Democrats. At one thirty in the morning March 2, during a remarkable joint session of Congress, a Democratic filibuster in the House collapsed after fourteen hours, and any semblance of order disappeared. The Congress of the United States descended into bedlam.
In an extra edition that hit the streets within hours, the Times described “An exhibition of rowdyism which would have disgraced a Democratic ward convention.” Members of both parties were screaming for attention, arguments had broken out everywhere on the floor and women in the galleries, “fearful of a free fight,” were escorted out. Acting Vice President Ferry, presiding over the joint session, pounded his gavel over and over, trying desperately to restore some sense of decorum. As he did, New York congressman George Beebe “mounted his desk and running over the tops of four desks in front of him, denounced the rulings of the Speaker unlawful and unjust... The noise and confusion which was caused by Beebe’s disgraceful performance exceeded anything ever known in Congress.”
Sufficient order was finally restored to move forward with the business of selecting a president. At 4:10 a.m., the electoral college vote was approved, and Rutherford B. Hayes became the nineteenth president of the United States. Hayes was asleep on a train en route to Washington. An aide opened his stateroom door and told him quite anticlimactically, “It’s all right, Your Honor. You have been voted in... The thing is decided and you’ve been declared elected President.”
“Is that so?” Hayes replied. After being assured the news was accurate and he was to become the next president, he said, “Well, I declare,” thanked the man for delivering the news, then turned over and went back to sleep.
Despite losing the presidency, Southern Democrats were elated. “Louisiana Republicans are completely disheartened,” the Picayune wrote. “It is authoritatively stated that President Grant will withdraw the United States troops and leave Packard to his fate, carrying out the States rights doctrine enunciated by the Electoral Commission.”
Some Republicans still held out hope Packard could retain power. “A covenant that the new administration shall abandon the Southern Republicans,” newspapers reported, “leaving them to be dealt with by their opponents...would be a base surrender, of which no one who knows anything about Mr. Hayes would believe him capable.”
They could not have been more wrong. In accordance with the compromise, among the first actions Hayes took after being inaugurated was to order the remaining federal troops withdrawn from Southern states. Packard was a realist: he accepted the fact that his administration would not survive without federal protection. The difficulty was how to legally cede power to Nicholls. Finally, it was decided to follow the national model and appoint a commission to figure it out.
Deals were made to satisfy everyone. Having no alternative, Packard abandoned the State House and told his militia to disband, to go home. He remained convinced that his government, the state’s legally elected government, had been usurped. His bitter parting words might have served as a eulogy for Reconstruction. He told the four hundred and fifty supporters who had gathered there in the middle of the night to witness his surrender, “Louisiana, the first state rehabilitated after the war, is the last State whose government thus falls.”
Packard was appointed American consul to Liverpool, England. Liverpool was a major international trading center, and this was among the most prestigious and lucrative appointments in the entire foreign service. Among his predecessors in the position was the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. State Supreme Court justices got new offices, clearing the way for a Democratic majority on the Court. Members of Packard’s Republican legislature slid easily into the Democratic State House and Senate, giving Nicholls a majority in both.
For Democrats, April 24, 1877, “was a gala day for New Orleans, indeed for the whole State. It witnessed the triumph of law and justice over wrong and oppression... At 11 a.m. the streets were absolutely jammed with a living mass of humanity,” there to witness “the final deliverance of the State.”
At eleven thirty, the 3rd Infantry, clad in dress uniform and accompanied by the regimental band, proceeded to the levee and boarded the steamer the Palace. About twelve thirty, to the roar of one hundred guns and deafening cheers, the Palace left its moorings, leaving behind the debris of the election of 1872.

EPILOGUE
As the United States military sailed out of New Orleans, Jim Crow came marching in. The origin of the name Jim Crow was a buffoonish, dancing blackface character created by white performer Thomas Dartmouth “Daddy” Rice in the 1830s. The popularity of his demeaning caricature laid the foundation for the minstrel shows which became a staple of American stages for decades.
Far more importantly, Jim Crow became the catch-all phrase encompassing all the laws, regulations, customs and traditions that robbed Black Americans of their constitutional rights. With the withdrawal of the troops that had been enforcing Reconstruction, Jim Crow almost instantly turned African Americans into second-class citizens.
Even if President Hayes had wanted to protect the rights of Black citizens—and there is little evidence that he did—the Supreme Court had made that impossible almost a year earlier. The Court’s decision in US v. Cruikshank was among the most significant ramifications of Louisiana’s 1872 election and the Colfax Massacre; the ruling would play a significant role in shaping American history and impacting millions of lives for nearly a century.
Following the Colfax Massacre, the federal government had brought charges against William Cruikshank and eighty more white men, claiming they had violated the Enforcement Act of 1870 by conspiring to deprive freedmen of their constitutional rights. Specifically, they cited the First Amendment freedom of assembly, the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship to all Americans. The Enforcement Act had been passed to give the federal government the power to take action against the Ku Klux Klan and other marauding white vigilante groups who used violence—including murder—to prevent Black men from voting.
But the court case focused on the still-unsettled balance between state and federal rights. Which entity had what rights to govern behavior in what situations? How far could Washington go to impose its laws on the citizens of Louisiana? The Civil War had not settled that question.
Eventually seventeen men, including Cruikshank, were tried in federal district court on sixteen charges—notably not murder—and convicted. Their attorneys appealed, arguing that the federal government lacked jurisdiction, that previous Supreme Court decisions had made prosecuting such crimes a state matter.
It took the Supreme Court a year to reach its decision. It threw out the convictions, deciding the federal government had no constitutional right to bring civil rights charges against individuals. “There is in our political system a government of each of the several states, and a Government of the United States,” wrote Chief Justice Morrison Waite. “The same person may be at the same time a citizen of the United States and a citizen of a State, but his rights of citizenship under one of those governments will be different from those he has under the other.”
Waite wrote that the rights of the federal government were limited to protecting a citizen from actions taken by the State, not against offenses committed against them by other people. The federal government could bring action against a state government, but not, as was done in this case, against individuals. And even then those actions were restricted to those specifically enumerated and defined.
There also were a limited number of situations in which both governments had jurisdiction; for example, both the federal government and state government could prosecute an individual passing counterfeit money, although the actual cause of action would be different. “All that cannot be granted or secured are left under the protection of the States.”
Democrats were euphoric. “The announcement will be hailed with delight everywhere by all friends of constitutional government,” the Picayune editorialized. “The reserved rights of the States have been recognized by the highest judicial tribunal in the land; the conditions on which the Union was founded have been reaffirmed, and the lawlessness of the party which insists upon what it calls ‘the higher law’ has received a final and overwhelming rebuke.”
The Court also found that the federal government could not infringe the Second Amendment right to bear arms, that any regulation of guns was restricted to “municipal legislation.”
The ruling left it entirely to the states to choose how and when civil rights laws would be enforced. It was up to state governments, legislatures and courts to regulate race relations. And so they did, relegating Black Americans to the back of the bus, underfunded and underequipped public schools, and segregated seating in public venues. The Jim Crow laws prohibited them from attending state colleges, dining in white restaurants and cafeterias, or even getting proper medical care. It legalized discrimination in the workplace and trades, and designated where Black Americans could live or shop, serve on a jury or go to the movies, and going full circle, whether or not they could vote.
Louisiana Democrats took full advantage of this opportunity, passing legislation in 1898 that effectively disenfranchised most Black residents. Prohibiting them from voting guaranteed the election of white men committed to perpetuating a racist, segregated society—and there was nothing the federal government could do to rectify that.
Cruikshank affected every aspect of Black life, from before birth to after death. Perhaps most importantly, Cruikshank gave states, cities, towns and villages the power to decide what crimes to prosecute or ignore, in some places allowing people literally to get away with murder. As a distraught William Kellogg said, Cruikshank “was regarded as establishing the principle that hereafter no white man could be punished for killing a n—o.”
This decision became the foundation of Southern segregation.
It seems incredible that a Louisiana gubernatorial election could have this massive, long-lasting impact on the entire nation, but that is precisely what happened.
The consequences of that election weren’t limited to legalizing segregation. To prevent the electoral college debacle that took place after the 1876 election from ever happening again, Congress eventually passed the Electoral Count Act of
