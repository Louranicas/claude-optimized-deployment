## 🛡️ CRITICAL FINDINGS AND MITIGATIONS

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **HTTP Client Dependency Missing**
   - **Impact:** Cannot test API endpoints or external services
   - **Mitigation:** Install httpx or configure virtual environment
   - **Priority:** HIGH

2. **Service Connectivity Validation Limited**
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify actual service-to-service communication
   - **Mitigation:** Set up proper testing environment with running services
   - **Priority:** HIGH

### Architecture Strengths:
1. **Robust Data Flow Design:** Well-architected communication patterns
2. **Database Integration:** Solid transaction handling and connection management
3. **Configuration Management:** Comprehensive YAML-based configuration
4. **Memory Management:** Efficient shared memory implementation
5. **Error Handling:** Proper error propagation and logging patterns
