## System Resource Usage

| Resource | Average | Peak |
|----------|---------|------|
| CPU Usage | 1.4% | 1.8% |
| Memory Usage | 31.4% | 31.6% |

## SLA Compliance Analysis

**Overall SLA Compliance: 50.0%**

Target vs Actual Performance:
- P95 Response Time: 0ms (Target: ≤2000ms)
- P99 Response Time: 0ms (Target: ≤5000ms)  
- Error Rate: 50.00% (Target: ≤1%)

## Stability Assessment

**Stability Score: 25.2%**

The stability score measures system consistency and reliability over the test duration.
A score above 80% indicates good stability for production deployment.

## Hourly Performance Breakdown

| Hour | Users | RPS | Avg RT (ms) | Error Rate | CPU % | Memory % |
|------|-------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|----------|
|  1 |  31 |  31.0 |      0 | 50.00% |   1.8 |   31.6 |
|  2 |  39 |  38.9 |      0 | 50.00% |   1.0 |   31.2 |

## Recommendations

1. High error rate (50.00%) requires investigation and fixes
2. System may be at capacity limits - consider horizontal scaling
3. Implement comprehensive monitoring in production
4. Set up automated alerting for performance degradation
5. Consider implementing auto-scaling based on load patterns
6. Plan capacity for 20% above peak load observed in testing
7. Implement circuit breakers for external service dependencies
8. Set up regular performance testing as part of CI/CD pipeline


## Production Capacity Planning

Based on the load test results:

1. **Recommended Production Capacity:**
   - Scale to handle 47 RPS (20% above peak observed)
   - Monitor CPU usage to stay below 70% under normal load
   - Monitor memory usage to stay below 70% under normal load

2. **Scaling Triggers:**
   - Scale up when: CPU > 70% for 5+ minutes OR Response time P95 > 1500ms
   - Scale down when: CPU < 30% for 15+ minutes AND Response time P95 < 500ms

3. **Resource Allocation:**
   - CPU: Plan for 2% peak capacity
   - Memory: Plan for 41% peak capacity

## Test Methodology

This 24-hour sustained load test simulated realistic traffic patterns including:
- Daily traffic cycles (low at night, peak during business hours)
- Gradual load increase over time
- Random traffic spikes
- Multiple user scenarios: casual users (60%), API users (30%), heavy users (10%)

The test validates system stability, performance consistency, and resource utilization under sustained load conditions typical of production environments.

**Test Environment:** Development/Staging  
**Framework Version:** 1.0.0
