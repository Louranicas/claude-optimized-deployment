## 2. Core Architecture and Protocols

### 2.1 Base Protocol Implementation

```python
class MCPServer:
    def __init__(self, name: str, version: str = "1.0.0", permission_checker: Optional[Any] = None):
        self.name = name
        self.version = version
        self.permission_checker = permission_checker
        self.required_permissions = {
            "list_tools": f"mcp.{name}:list",
            "call_tool": f"mcp.{name}:execute",
            "get_info": f"mcp.{name}:read"

```

**Key Protocol Features:**
- Mandatory authentication for all operations
- Fine-grained permission checking at tool level
- Standardized request/response format
- Built-in error handling and logging

   - User context propagation throughout execution

2. **Authorization Layer**
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Tool-specific permission requirements
   - Dynamic permission checking

3. **Input Validation**
   - Parameter sanitization
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Command injection protection
   - SSRF protection for external requests

4. **Rate Limiting & Circuit Breakers**
   - Per-user rate limiting
   - Circuit breaker pattern for external services
   - Automatic backoff and retry logic
