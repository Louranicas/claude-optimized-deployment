### Key Rust Dependencies
```toml
# Core dependencies
pyo3 = "0.21.0"              # Python bindings
tokio = "1.35"               # Async runtime
rayon = "1.8"                # Parallel processing
serde = "1.0"                # Serialization
dashmap = "5.5"              # Concurrent hashmap
argon2 = "0.5"               # Password hashing
aes-gcm = "0.10"             # Encryption
```

## 📊 Performance Approach

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Profile First**: Identify actual bottlenecks using cProfile/py-spy
2. **Measure Baseline**: Document current Python performance
3. **Implement Selectively**: Use Rust for CPU-bound, high-frequency operations
4. **Validate Improvements**: Benchmark in realistic conditions
5. **Document Results**: Record actual measurements, not estimates

### Expected Performance Ranges
- **CPU-bound operations**: 2-10x improvement potential
- **Memory usage**: 30-50% reduction typical
- **Parallel workloads**: Scales with available cores
- **I/O-bound operations**: Minimal improvement expected

*Note: Actual improvements are highly workload-dependent*

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Python-Rust Bridge
```python
# Example usage
from code_rust_core import infrastructure, performance, security

# Service scanning with parallel execution
scanner = infrastructure.ServiceScanner()
results = scanner.scan_services(service_list)

# Task execution with resource pooling
executor = performance.TaskExecutor()
results = executor.execute_batch(tasks)

# Security operations
vault = security.SecureVault(key)
encrypted = vault.encrypt(data)
```

## ✨ Key Features Added

1. **Parallel Execution Framework**
   - Task type classification
   - Resource pooling
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Infrastructure Automation**
   - Service health checks
   - Configuration parsing
   - Log analysis

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Cryptographic operations in Rust
   - Security auditing
   - Batch password operations

4. **Performance Tooling**
   - Benchmarking utilities
   - Profiling integration
   - Metrics collection

## 📝 Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md with realistic expectations
- ✅ Created pragmatic Rust Integration Guide
- ✅ Updated AI documentation index
- ✅ Removed unsubstantiated performance claims
- ✅ Added benchmarking methodology

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Build Rust Extensions**
   ```bash
   cd rust_core
   maturin develop --release
   ```

2. **Benchmark Actual Workloads**
   ```python
   # Profile Python baseline
   python -m cProfile -o baseline.prof your_script.py
   
   # Compare with Rust implementation
   python benchmark_rust.py
   ```

3. **Document Real Performance**
   - Record environment details
   - Specify workload characteristics
   - Include statistical analysis
   - Note overhead considerations

## ⚖️ Pragmatic Considerations

### When Rust Makes Sense
- Processing >10MB of data regularly
- CPU-bound operations taking >100ms
- Operations called >1000 times per minute
- Memory-constrained environments

### When Python is Better
- Rapid prototyping
- I/O-bound operations
- Simple CRUD operations
- Small data volumes
