## Runbook Usage Guidelines

1. **Always follow the appropriate runbook** for the situation
2. **Document all actions taken** during incidents
3. **Update runbooks** based on lessons learned
4. **Test procedures regularly** during maintenance windows
5. **Keep contact information current**
6. **Escalate when in doubt** - it's better to over-communicate

4. Include rollback procedures where applicable
