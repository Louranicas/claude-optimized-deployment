## Overview

This runbook defines the escalation procedures for the CODE project to ensure that incidents, issues, and decisions are appropriately elevated through the organizational hierarchy. Proper escalation ensures rapid resolution, appropriate resource allocation, and stakeholder awareness.

### Escalation Principles

- **Time-based**: Escalate when resolution time exceeds defined thresholds
- **Impact-based**: Escalate when business impact requires higher authority
- **Complexity-based**: Escalate when expertise beyond current team is needed
- **Risk-based**: Escalate when potential risks require management awareness
- **Resource-based**: Escalate when additional resources are required

### Escalation Objectives

- Ensure appropriate level of attention for incidents
- Mobilize necessary resources quickly
- Maintain stakeholder awareness
- Enable rapid decision-making
- Preserve audit trails and accountability

## Escalation Matrix

### Impact-Based Triggers

#### Business Impact Escalation

```markdown
Customer Impact Levels:
- No customers affected: Normal escalation
- <100 customers affected: Manager notification
- 100-1000 customers affected: Director notification
- >1000 customers affected: Executive notification
- All customers affected: CEO notification

Revenue Impact Levels:
- <$1K/hour loss: Normal escalation
- $1K-$10K/hour loss: Manager notification
- $10K-$100K/hour loss: Director notification
- >$100K/hour loss: Executive notification
```

#### Security Impact Escalation

```markdown
Data Sensitivity Levels:
- Public data exposure: Normal escalation
- Internal data exposure: Manager notification
- Customer data exposure: CISO notification
- PII/PHI exposure: Legal + Executive notification
- Financial data exposure: CEO + Board notification

Security Breach Severity:
- Attempted breach: Security team handles
- Successful unauthorized access: CISO notification
- Data exfiltration suspected: Executive notification
- Confirmed data breach: CEO + Legal notification
- Regulatory reportable: Board notification
```

### Complexity-Based Triggers

#### Technical Complexity

```markdown
Escalate when:
- Issue requires expertise not available in current team
- Cross-team coordination needed
- Third-party vendor engagement required
- Infrastructure changes beyond team authority
- Security implications beyond normal scope
```

#### Organizational Complexity

```markdown
Escalate when:
- Multiple departments affected
- Customer communication required
- Legal/compliance implications
- Regulatory reporting needed
- Media/PR attention possible
```

## Escalation Pathways

### Technical Incident Escalation

#### Standard Technical Escalation Flow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# technical-escalation.sh

INCIDENT_SEVERITY="$1"
TIME_ELAPSED="$2"
CURRENT_ASSIGNEE="$3"

case $INCIDENT_SEVERITY in
  "SEV1")
    if [ $TIME_ELAPSED -gt 30 ]; then
      escalate_to_manager "$CURRENT_ASSIGNEE"
    fi
    if [ $TIME_ELAPSED -gt 60 ]; then
      escalate_to_director "$CURRENT_ASSIGNEE"
    fi
    if [ $TIME_ELAPSED -gt 120 ]; then
      escalate_to_cto "$CURRENT_ASSIGNEE"
    fi
    ;;
  "SEV2")
    if [ $TIME_ELAPSED -gt 120 ]; then
      escalate_to_manager "$CURRENT_ASSIGNEE"
    fi
    if [ $TIME_ELAPSED -gt 240 ]; then
      escalate_to_director "$CURRENT_ASSIGNEE"
    fi
    ;;
esac
```

#### Technical Escalation Decision Tree

```
Issue Detected
â”œâ”€ Can current team resolve? 
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Continue with current team
â”‚  â””â”€ No â†’ What expertise is needed?
â”‚      â”œâ”€ Database â†’ Escalate to DBA team
â”‚      â”œâ”€ Security â†’ Escalate to Security team
â”‚      â”œâ”€ Infrastructure â†’ Escalate to DevOps team
â”‚      â””â”€ Architecture â†’ Escalate to Principal Engineer
â”œâ”€ Is it time-critical?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Follow time-based escalation
â”‚  â””â”€ No â†’ Follow standard process
â””â”€ Does it affect customers?
   â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Notify Customer Support + Management
   â””â”€ No â†’ Continue technical resolution

#### Quick Decision Framework

```
Is immediate action required to prevent further damage?
â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Take action within authority level, notify next level
â””â”€ No â†’ Can we get approval within safe timeframe?
    â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Seek approval before action
    â””â”€ No â†’ Take action, document decision, notify immediately
```

#### Risk Assessment for Decisions

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# decision-risk-assessment.sh

ACTION="$1"
POTENTIAL_IMPACT="$2"
TIME_CONSTRAINT="$3"

assess_risk_level() {
  local action="$1"
  local impact="$2"
  local time="$3"
  
  case $impact in
    "high")
      if [ $time -lt 30 ]; then

      else
        echo "escalate_for_approval"
      fi
      ;;
    "medium")
      if [ $time -lt 60 ]; then
        echo "proceed_with_notification"
      else
        echo "seek_approval"
      fi
      ;;
    "low")
      echo "standard_process"
      ;;
  esac
}

RISK_ASSESSMENT=$(assess_risk_level "$ACTION" "$POTENTIAL_IMPACT" "$TIME_CONSTRAINT")

case $RISK_ASSESSMENT in
  "immediate_action_required")
    echo "Take immediate action and notify all stakeholders"
    ;;

## De-escalation Procedures

### Conditions for De-escalation

```markdown
De-escalation is appropriate when:
- Incident severity has been reduced
- Immediate risk has been mitigated
- Business impact has been minimized
- Root cause has been identified and addressed
- Stakeholder confidence has been restored
```

### De-escalation Process

#### Technical De-escalation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# de-escalation.sh

INCIDENT_ID="$1"
CURRENT_ESCALATION_LEVEL="$2"
NEW_SEVERITY="$3"

de_escalate_incident() {
  # Verify conditions for de-escalation
  if validate_de_escalation_criteria "$INCIDENT_ID"; then
    # Update incident severity
    update_incident_severity "$INCIDENT_ID" "$NEW_SEVERITY"
    
    # Notify stakeholders of de-escalation
    send_de_escalation_notification "$INCIDENT_ID" "$CURRENT_ESCALATION_LEVEL"
    
    # Adjust monitoring and response accordingly
    adjust_response_level "$NEW_SEVERITY"
    
    echo "Incident $INCIDENT_ID de-escalated from $CURRENT_ESCALATION_LEVEL"
  else
    echo "De-escalation criteria not met for $INCIDENT_ID"
  fi
}

validate_de_escalation_criteria() {
  local incident_id="$1"
  
  # Check if immediate risk is mitigated
  if ! check_immediate_risk_mitigated "$incident_id"; then
    return 1
  fi
  
  # Check if systems are stable
  if ! check_system_stability; then
    return 1
  fi
  
  # Check if business impact is reduced
  if ! check_business_impact_reduced "$incident_id"; then
    return 1
  fi
  
  return 0
}

de_escalate_incident
```
