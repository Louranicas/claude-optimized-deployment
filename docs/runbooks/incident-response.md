## Overview

This runbook defines the standardized incident response procedures for the CODE project. It ensures consistent, efficient handling of all incidents from detection through resolution and post-mortem.

### Objectives
- Minimize service downtime and customer impact
- Ensure clear communication throughout incidents
- Maintain detailed incident documentation
- Learn from incidents to prevent recurrence
- Comply with SLA commitments

### Key Principles
- **Customer First**: Prioritize customer impact minimization
- **Communicate Early and Often**: Keep all stakeholders informed
- **Blameless Culture**: Focus on learning, not blame
- **Documentation**: Record everything for learning and compliance
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use incidents to strengthen systems

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### SEV1 - Critical
**Response Time**: Immediate (within 5 minutes)
**Escalation**: Immediate to on-call engineer and manager

**Criteria**:
- Complete service outage affecting all customers
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach or unauthorized access
- Payment processing down
- Critical customer-facing functionality completely broken

**Example Scenarios**:
- API returning 5xx errors for >95% of requests
- Database completely inaccessible
- Authentication system down
- Data breach detected
- Primary AWS region completely unavailable

#### SEV2 - High
**Response Time**: 30 minutes
**Escalation**: On-call engineer, notify manager within 30 minutes

**Criteria**:
- Significant performance degradation (>50% slower)
- Partial functionality broken affecting multiple customers
- High error rates (>5%)
- Database performance issues
- Critical third-party service outage

**Example Scenarios**:
- API response times >5 seconds
- 10-50% of requests failing
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Payment processing errors
- Key integration partner down

#### SEV3 - Medium
**Response Time**: 2 hours
**Escalation**: On-call engineer handles, notify manager if extends >4 hours

**Criteria**:
- Minor performance issues
- Non-critical features broken
- Elevated error rates (1-5%)
- Monitoring/alerting issues
- Single customer impact

**Example Scenarios**:
- Minor API endpoints returning errors
- Dashboard loading slowly
- Background job failures
- Minor UI glitches
- Single customer reporting issues

#### SEV4 - Low
**Response Time**: Next business day
**Escalation**: Regular team triage

**Criteria**:
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation needs
- Non-urgent feature requests
- Development environment issues

## Incident Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Detection and Triage (0-5 minutes)

#### Detection Sources
- Automated monitoring alerts
- Customer reports
- Team member discovery
- Third-party service notifications

#### Initial Response Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] Acknowledge alert/report within 5 minutes
- [ ] Assess initial severity level
- [ ] Create incident ticket/channel
- [ ] Assign Incident Commander
- [ ] Begin investigation
- [ ] Notify initial stakeholders
```

#### Triage Decision Tree
```
Is service completely down?
â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ SEV1
â””â”€ No
    â””â”€ Are multiple customers affected?
        â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ SEV2
        â””â”€ No
            â””â”€ Is core functionality impacted?
                â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ SEV3
                â””â”€ No â†’ SEV4
```

### Phase 2: Investigation and Response (First 30 minutes)

#### Investigation Workflow

1. **Gather Initial Information**:
   ```bash
   # Check system health
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl get pods -n claude-deployment-prod
   
   # Check recent changes
   git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago"
   kubectl rollout history deployment/claude-deployment-api -n claude-deployment-prod
   
   # Check metrics
   curl -s 'http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=claude_deployment:api_error_rate_5m'
   ```

2. **Form Response Team**:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Assign Incident Commander
   - [ ] Assign Technical Lead
   - [ ] Assign Communications Lead
   - [ ] Assign Scribe
   - [ ] Identify needed SMEs
   ```

3. **Establish Communication Channels**:
   ```bash
   # Create incident Slack channel
   /incident create "Brief description of incident"
   
   # Set up war room if SEV1/SEV2
   /join #incident-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS
   ```

4. **Begin Status Communication**:
   - Update status page (for SEV1/SEV2)
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Set expectation for next update

#### Investigation Commands Reference

```bash
# System Health Checks
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get pods -n claude-deployment-prod -o wide

   # Reduce traffic load
   kubectl scale deployment claude-deployment-api --replicas=10 -n claude-deployment-prod
   
   # Enable circuit breaker
   kubectl patch configmap claude-deployment-config -n claude-deployment-prod \
     -p '{"data":{"circuit-breaker-enabled":"true"}}'
   
   # Activate maintenance page
   kubectl apply -f k8s/maintenance-page.yaml
   ```

2. **Rollback Procedures**:
   ```bash
   # Emergency rollback
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/claude-deployment-api -n claude-deployment-prod
   
   # Rollback to specific version
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/claude-deployment-api \
     --to-revision=5 -n claude-deployment-prod
   
   # Monitor rollback
   kubectl rollout status deployment/claude-deployment-api -n claude-deployment-prod
   ```

3. **Feature Toggles**:
   ```bash
   # Disable problematic feature
   kubectl patch configmap claude-deployment-config -n claude-deployment-prod \
     -p '{"data":{"feature-xyz-enabled":"false"}}'
   
   # Restart pods to apply changes
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/claude-deployment-api -n claude-deployment-prod
   ```

#### Resolution Verification
