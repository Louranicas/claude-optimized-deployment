Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for the Claude-Optimized Deployment Engine (CODE). 
This documentation provides everything you need to integrate with CODE's powerful infrastructure 
automation capabilities.

What is CODE?
=============

The Claude-Optimized Deployment Engine is a hybrid Python/Rust infrastructure management system 
with AI-powered consultation capabilities and comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. 
It provides:

‚úÖ **51+ MCP Tools** across 11 servers for complete infrastructure automation

‚úÖ **AI-Powered Consultation** through the Circle of Experts system  

‚úÖ **Multi-Platform Support** for Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, and more

‚úÖ **Security-First Design** with automated vulnerability scanning

‚úÖ **Real-Time Monitoring** with Prometheus and alert management

‚úÖ **Team Collaboration** through Slack notifications and webhooks

.. note::
   **Current Status**: 70% complete and fully functional for deployment automation.
   The system is production-ready for containerized applications and Kubernetes deployments.

Quick Start
===========

Get started with CODE in minutes:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Docker (Recommended)

      .. code-block:: bash

         # Clone and start with Docker Compose
         git clone https://github.com/your-org/claude-optimized-deployment.git
         cd claude-optimized-deployment
         docker-compose up -d

         # API available at http://localhost:8000

         import asyncio
         from clients.python_client import CODEClient

         async def main():
             async with CODEClient("http://localhost:8000", "your-api-key") as client:
                 health = await client.circuit_breakers.get_health()
                 print(f"System health: {health['health']}")

         asyncio.run(main())

   .. tab:: JavaScript Client

      .. code-block:: javascript

         // Install and use JavaScript client
         npm install axios

         const { CODEClient } = require('./clients/javascript-client');

         async function main() {
             const client = new CODEClient('http://localhost:8000', 'your-api-key');
             const health = await client.circuitBreakers.getHealth();
             console.log(`System health: ${health.health}`);
         }

         main().catch(console.error);
