## 🎯 Overview

Claude Code is a command-line tool for agentic coding that integrates Claude directly into development workflows. This guide outlines best practices specifically tailored for the CODE project.

## 🔍 Research-First Development

### The Two-Step Approach

Always ask Claude to research and plan before implementing:

```bash
# Step 1: Research
claude "Research best practices for implementing a Terraform wrapper that supports multi-cloud deployments. Look for existing patterns, common pitfalls, and recommended architectures."

# Step 2: Plan
claude "Based on the research, create a detailed implementation plan for our Terraform wrapper, including module structure, error handling, and state management approach."

# Step 3: Implement
claude "Now implement the Terraform wrapper according to the plan, starting with the core module structure."
```

### Why This Matters

Without explicit research and planning steps, Claude tends to jump straight to coding. For complex problems like deployment engine architecture, the research phase significantly improves the quality of the final implementation.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

### TDD Workflow with Claude Code

```bash
# 1. Write tests first
claude "Write comprehensive tests for a DeploymentEngine class that should:
- Deploy Docker containers
- Track deployment state
- Support rollback functionality
- Handle errors gracefully
Use pytest and include edge cases. Do NOT implement the class yet."

# 2. Verify tests fail
claude "Run the tests and confirm they all fail since we haven't implemented anything yet."

# 3. Implement to pass tests
claude "Now implement the DeploymentEngine class to make all tests pass. Follow TDD principles."

# 4. Refactor
claude "The tests are passing. Now refactor the implementation for better performance and cleaner code while keeping tests green."
```

### Example: Circle of Experts Enhancement

```python
# .claude/commands/tdd-expert.md
Implement a new expert type for the Circle of Experts using TDD: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Write comprehensive tests for the new expert including:
   - Initialization tests
   - Query processing tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Integration with existing experts
2. Run tests and verify they fail
3. Implement the expert class to pass all tests
4. Add integration tests with the expert manager
5. Refactor for optimal performance
```

## 📝 Custom Slash Commands

### Setting Up Project-Specific Commands

Create a `.claude/commands/` directory in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
```

### Essential Commands for CODE Project

#### 1. Deployment Optimizer (`/optimize-deployment`)
```markdown
# .claude/commands/optimize-deployment.md
Optimize the deployment configuration for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Analyze current resource allocation
2. Check for over-provisioned resources
3. Review security group rules for unnecessary exposure
4. Suggest instance type optimizations
5. Calculate potential cost savings
6. Generate optimized Terraform/Kubernetes configs
7. Create a migration plan with rollback strategy
```

#### 2. Security Auditor (`/security-audit`)
```markdown
# .claude/commands/security-audit.md
Perform a security audit on: $ARGUMENTS

Checklist:
1. Scan for exposed credentials or API keys
2. Check IAM policies for overly permissive access
3. Review network security (open ports, security groups)
4. Analyze encryption settings (at rest and in transit)
5. Check for outdated dependencies
6. Review authentication mechanisms
7. Generate security report with remediation steps
```

#### 3. Cost Analyzer (`/analyze-costs`)
```markdown

Analyze cloud costs for: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Parse current cloud resource usage
2. Identify top cost drivers
3. Find unused or underutilized resources
4. Suggest reserved instance opportunities
5. Recommend spot instance candidates
6. Calculate savings from proposed changes
7. Generate cost optimization report
```

## 🎯 Specificity Guidelines

### Be Explicit About Requirements

```bash
# ❌ Vague
claude "Make the deployment faster"

# ✅ Specific
claude "Optimize the EKS deployment process to reduce deployment time from 15 minutes to under 5 minutes by:
1. Parallelizing non-dependent steps
2. Implementing incremental deployments
3. Using cached Docker layers
4. Pre-warming the cluster nodes
Maintain zero-downtime deployment capability."
```

### Provide Context Upfront

```bash
# ✅ Good context
claude "Context: We're building a deployment engine that needs to support multiple cloud providers.
Current limitation: Our Terraform wrapper only supports AWS.
Goal: Extend to support Azure and GCP while maintaining a unified interface.
Constraints: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing AWS deployments.
Task: Design the multi-cloud abstraction layer."
```

## 🐛 Debugging Workflows

### Effective Debugging with Claude

```bash
# 1. Describe the problem clearly
claude "Debug: Our Circle of Experts is timing out when querying more than 3 experts simultaneously.
Error: asyncio.TimeoutError after 30 seconds
Expected: Should handle 10 experts in parallel
Current code in src/circle_of_experts/manager.py"

# 2. Use iterative debugging
claude "Add detailed logging to trace where the timeout occurs"
claude "Based on the logs, identify the bottleneck"
claude "Implement a fix for the bottleneck while maintaining functionality"
```

### MCP Debug Mode

When working with Model Context Protocol:

```bash
# Launch with debug flag
claude --mcp-debug

# This helps identify configuration issues with tools
```

## 👥 Team Collaboration

### Shared Commands

Check slash commands into git for team consistency:

```bash
# Add to version control
git add .claude/commands/
git commit -m "Add team slash commands for deployment workflows"
```

### Documentation Standards

```markdown
# .claude/commands/document-feature.md
Document the implementation of: $ARGUMENTS

Include:
1. Feature overview and purpose
2. Technical architecture diagram (use mermaid)
3. API documentation with examples
4. Integration guide with existing features
5. Testing instructions
6. Performance characteristics
7. Known limitations and future improvements

Follow our documentation style guide in docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Profiling Before Optimizing

```bash
# Profile first
claude "Profile the deployment engine to identify performance bottlenecks.
Use cProfile and generate a flame graph.
Focus on the critical path from request to deployed infrastructure."

# Then optimize
claude "Based on the profiling results, optimize the top 3 bottlenecks.
Maintain functionality and add benchmarks to prevent regression."
```

### Batch Operations

```python
# .claude/commands/batch-optimize.md
Optimize this code for batch operations: $ARGUMENTS

Consider:
1. Identify operations that can be parallelized
2. Implement connection pooling where applicable
3. Use batch APIs instead of individual calls
4. Add progress tracking for long-running operations
5. Implement proper error handling for partial failures
6. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
```

## 📊 CODE Project Specific Patterns

### 1. Natural Language to Infrastructure

```bash
claude "Implement a natural language parser that converts:
'Deploy a web app with 3 replicas and a postgres database'
Into appropriate Terraform/Kubernetes configurations.
Use the Circle of Experts for ambiguity resolution."
```

### 2. Deployment State Management

```bash
claude "Design a state management system for deployments that:
1. Tracks all infrastructure changes
2. Supports rollback to any previous state
3. Handles concurrent deployments safely
4. Integrates with Git for GitOps workflow
Use event sourcing pattern."
```

### 3. Multi-Cloud Abstraction

```bash
claude "Create an abstraction layer that allows:
deployment = Deploy('nginx', replicas=3)
deployment.to_aws()  # Generates CloudFormation
deployment.to_azure()  # Generates ARM template
deployment.to_gcp()  # Generates Deployment Manager config
Ensure consistent behavior across clouds."
```

## 🛠️ Tool Integration

### Setting Up Claude Code with CODE Tools

```bash
# Configure MCP for infrastructure tools
claude-code configure-mcp \
  --tools=terraform,kubernetes,aws-cli,gcloud,azure-cli \
  --memory-enabled \
  --project-root=/path/to/code

# Test tool availability
claude "List all available tools and verify they're working"
```

### Custom Tool Creation

```python
# .claude/tools/deployment_validator.py
from claude_code import Tool

class DeploymentValidator(Tool):
    """Validate deployment configurations before applying"""
    
    name = "validate_deployment"
    description = "Validates Terraform/K8s configs for security and cost"
    
    async def execute(self, config_path: str) -> dict:
        # Implementation here
        return {
            "valid": True,
            "security_score": 95,
