- Use the bug report template when creating issues

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/claude_optimized_deployment/issues) to suggest enhancements
- Explain your idea and how it would benefit users
- Use the feature request template

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows our style guidelines
5. Issue that pull request!

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker Desktop
- Git
- (Optional) Rust toolchain for performance modules

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude_optimized_deployment.git
cd claude_optimized_deployment

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_circle_of_experts.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Building Rust Extensions (Optional)
```bash
cd rust_core
maturin develop --release
cd ..
```

## 📋 Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- We use Black for code formatting (line length: 88)
- We use isort for import sorting
- We use Ruff for linting
- Use type hints where possible
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add Docker deployment capability

- Implement basic container management
- Add state tracking for deployments
- Include rollback functionality

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation
- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Follow the "Document Reality" principle (see PRIME_DIRECTIVE_DOCUMENT_REALITY.md)

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas

Based on our [Gap Analysis](docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md), we're particularly interested in contributions for:

### 1. Core Deployment Engine (Priority 1) 🚨
The heart of the project that doesn't exist yet!

```python
# We need: src/deployment_engine/core.py
class DeploymentEngine:
    async def deploy(self, specification: DeploymentSpec) -> DeploymentResult:
        """Deploy infrastructure based on specification"""
        # This is what we're building!
```

Areas to help:
- Docker container deployment
- Terraform wrapper implementation
- State management system
- Rollback capabilities

### 2. Security Features (Priority 2) 🔐
Basic security is completely missing.

Areas to help:
- JWT authentication system
- API key management
- Basic RBAC implementation
- Secrets management

### 3. Cloud Provider Integration (Priority 3) ☁️
Start with AWS, expand from there.

Areas to help:
- AWS provider implementation
- Terraform module creation
- Infrastructure abstractions
- Cost estimation

### 4. Testing (Always Welcome) 🧪
We need more tests for everything!

Areas to help:
- Integration tests for deployment flow
- Unit tests for new features
- End-to-end testing framework
- Performance benchmarks

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── circle_of_experts/    # ✅ Working feature
├── deployment_engine/    # 🚧 Needs implementation
├── providers/           # 🚧 Cloud providers
├── security/           # 🚧 Auth and security
├── monitoring/         # 🚧 Observability
└── utils/             # Common utilities
```

### Design Principles
1. **Modular**: Each component should be independent
2. **Async First**: Use async/await for I/O operations
3. **Type Safe**: Use type hints and pydantic models
4. **Testable**: Write code with testing in mind
5. **Simple**: Start simple, iterate to complex
