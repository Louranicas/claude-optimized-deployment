# E0599 Method Resolution Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. service_mesh.rs
- **Issue**: Missing `digest()` function from sha2::Sha256
- **Fix**: Added `use sha2::Digest;` import to bring the Digest trait into scope
- **Line**: Added import at line 12

### 2. registry.rs  
- **Issue**: No E0599 errors found (the `entry()` method works correctly)
- **Fix**: No fix needed - HashMap entry() API was already working correctly with proper trait bounds

### 3. adaptive_learning.rs
- **Issue**: Multiple PyO3 API usage errors
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Removed all `.ok()?.flatten()` patterns - PyDict's `get_item()` returns `Option` not `Result`
  - Fixed `.ok()?` patterns on `get_item()` calls
  - Changed `extract::<usize>()` to `extract::<u32>()` to match the struct field type
  
## Summary

All three target files have been successfully fixed:
- ✅ service_mesh.rs - Added missing trait import
- ✅ registry.rs - No issues found, already correct
- ✅ adaptive_learning.rs - Fixed PyO3 API usage patterns

The E0599 method resolution errors in these specific files have been resolved. The fixes ensure:
1. All required traits are imported for method calls
2. PyO3 API is used correctly with Option handling
3. Type parameters match the expected types in struct definitions
