# Performance Claims Traceability Matrix
[LAST UPDATED: 2025-05-30]

## Purpose
Track all performance claims in the CODE project documentation with their verification status.

## Status Legend
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Claim backed by benchmark data
- ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED**: Claim needs benchmarking
- ❌ **DISPROVEN**: Claim found to be false
- 🔄 **MODIFIED**: Original claim adjusted based on evidence
- 📝 **THEORETICAL**: Based on theory, not measurement

## Claims Matrix

| Document | Claim | Source | Status | Evidence | Date Verified |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|---------------|
| ai_docs/00_AI_DOCS_INDEX.md | "2-10x improvement for CPU-bound" | General Rust knowledge | 📝 THEORETICAL | Industry estimates | - |
| ai_docs/00_AI_DOCS_INDEX.md | "30-50% memory reduction" | General Rust knowledge | 📝 THEORETICAL | Industry estimates | - |
| MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md | "55x faster service scanning" | [MIGRATED FROM: Watcher] | ❌ DISPROVEN | Unrealistic for network ops | 2025-05-30 |
| MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md | "83x faster log analysis" | [MIGRATED FROM: Watcher] | ❌ DISPROVEN | No supporting benchmark | 2025-05-30 |
| rust_integration.md | "2-5x for JSON parsing" | Rust community benchmarks | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Needs CODE-specific test | - |
| rust_integration.md | "3-10x for regex matching" | Rust community benchmarks | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Needs CODE-specific test | - |

## Benchmark Requirements

### Priority 1 - Core Claims
1. **Service Scanning Performance**
   - Test sizes: 1, 10, 50, 100, 250 services
   - Network conditions: Local, LAN, WAN
   - Measure: Total time, per-service time
   - Compare: Python sequential vs Rust parallel

2. **Configuration Parsing**
   - Test sizes: 1KB, 100KB, 1MB, 10MB YAML/JSON
   - Measure: Parse time, memory usage
   - Compare: PyYAML vs serde

3. **Log Analysis**
   - Test sizes: 1MB, 10MB, 100MB, 1GB logs
   - Patterns: Simple regex, complex regex
   - Measure: Processing time, matches found
   - Compare: Python re vs Rust regex

### Priority 2 - Security Operations
1. **Password Hashing**
   - Batch sizes: 10, 100, 1000 passwords
   - Algorithm: Argon2
   - Measure: Total time, per-password time
   - Compare: Python vs Rust implementation

2. **Encryption/Decryption**
   - Data sizes: 1KB, 1MB, 100MB
   - Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
   - Measure: Throughput (MB/s)
   - Compare: Python cryptography vs Rust

## Verification Process

1. **Before Making a Claim**
   - [ ] Is there a benchmark for this?
   - [ ] Is the benchmark reproducible?
   - [ ] Is the test data realistic?
   - [ ] Are conditions documented?

2. **When Documenting Performance**
   - [ ] Include benchmark filename
   - [ ] State test conditions
   - [ ] Provide statistical measures (median, not just mean)
   - [ ] Note variance/stability
   - [ ] Include date of measurement

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Monthly: Re-run priority 1 benchmarks
   - Quarterly: Full benchmark suite
   - On change: Re-test affected components

## Example Claim Documentation

### Good ✅
```markdown
Configuration parsing shows 3.2x median speedup for files >1MB
[VERIFIED: benchmark_config_parsing_20250530.json]
- Test: 10MB YAML, 100 iterations
- Python median: 1.23s (σ=0.05s)
- Rust median: 0.38s (σ=0.02s)
- Environment: Ubuntu 22.04, 8-core CPU
```

### Bad ❌
```markdown
Rust makes everything blazing fast!
Our system is 100x faster!
Massive performance improvements across the board!
```

## Action Items

1. **Immediate**
   - [ ] Remove all unverified multiplier claims
   - [ ] Add [UNVERIFIED] tags where needed
   - [ ] Create benchmark suite structure

2. **This Week**
   - [ ] Benchmark service scanning
   - [ ] Benchmark config parsing
   - [ ] Update docs with real numbers

3. **This Month**
   - [ ] Complete all Priority 1 benchmarks
   - [ ] Create automated benchmark CI job
   - [ ] Publish first performance report

## Notes

- Network operations rarely see >2x improvement from code optimization
- I/O-bound operations are limited by hardware, not language
- Memory usage improvements are often more significant than speed
- Parallelization benefits depend on workload characteristics
- Always consider total system performance, not just microbenchmarks
