# Agent 4 - Docker Security Fix Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed Docker security issues in both `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` files by removing privileged mode and implementing security best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed cAdvisor Service
**Location**: Both `/docker-compose.monitoring.yml` and `/src/monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml`

**Before**:
```yaml
privileged: true
```

**After**:
```yaml
user: "1000:1000"
cap_add:
  - SYS_ADMIN
cap_drop:
  - ALL
```

### 2. Added Non-Root User to All Services
Applied `user: "1000:1000"` to the following services in both files:
- prometheus
- grafana
- jaeger
- alertmanager
- node-exporter (using `user: "65534:65534"` for nobody user)
- pushgateway
- cadvisor
- redis
- postgres
- loki
- promtail

### 3. Security Improvements

#### Removed Privileged Mode
- Replaced `privileged: true` with specific capabilities
- Added `cap_add: [SYS_ADMIN]` only for cadvisor (required for container metrics)
- Added `cap_drop: [ALL]` to drop all other capabilities

#### Running as Non-Root
- All containers now run as non-root user (UID 1000)
- Node-exporter uses the nobody user (UID 65534) as recommended

#### Read-Only Volumes
- All volume mounts that don't require write access are already mounted as read-only (`:ro`)
- Examples: `/:/rootfs:ro`, `/var/run:/var/run:ro`, `/sys:/sys:ro`

## Files Modified
1. `/home/louranicas/projects/claude-optimized-deployment/docker-compose.monitoring.yml`
2. `/home/louranicas/projects/claude-optimized-deployment/src/monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml`

## Security Benefits
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Containers only have the specific capabilities they need
2. **Non-Root Execution**: Reduces the impact of container breakouts
3. **Read-Only Mounts**: Prevents unauthorized modifications to host filesystem
4. **Capability Restrictions**: Limits what containers can do even if compromised

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test that all monitoring services start correctly with the new user permissions
2. Verify that metrics collection still works for all exporters
3. Check that cadvisor can still collect container metrics with limited capabilities
4. Ensure Grafana dashboards display data correctly

## Notes
- Some services may require additional volume permissions or configuration adjustments
- The user ID 1000 should exist on the host system or be created
- For production deployments, consider using service-specific user IDs for better isolation
