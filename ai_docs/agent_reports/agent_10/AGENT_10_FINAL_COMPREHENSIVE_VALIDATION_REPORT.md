❌ sklearn: Missing (FAIL)
❌ torch: Missing (FAIL)
❌ pandas: Missing (FAIL)
❌ transformers: Missing (FAIL)
❌ seaborn: Missing (FAIL)

Success Rate: 28.6% (2/7 dependencies available)
```

#### Rust Compilation Analysis
```
Status: FAILED
Error Count: 14 compilation errors
Critical Issues:

- Missing StateManager implementation
- FFI integration compilation failures
- Unsafe code violations in shared memory module
```

#### FFI Integration Status
```
Status: FAILED
Issue: mcp_learning module not importable
Root Cause: Rust compilation failures prevent FFI binding generation
```

### Phase 2: MCP Server Validation

#### Server Infrastructure Assessment
```
✅ Development Server: Structure present, Python source available
✅ DevOps Server: Structure present, Python source available  
✅ Quality Server: Structure present, Python source available
✅ Bash God Server: Structure present, Python source available

All 4/4 MCP server directories exist with proper structure
Server import testing limited due to dependency issues
```

#### Server Memory Allocation Design
```
- Development Server: 4GB allocation (largest, handles ML workloads)
- DevOps Server: 2GB allocation (deployment predictions)
- Quality Server: 2GB allocation (code analysis)
- Bash God Server: 1GB allocation (command generation)

Total System Memory Requirement: 9GB
```

### Phase 3: Security Re-Audit

#### Security Tool Availability
```
❌ Bandit: Not available (installation blocked by system policies)
❌ pip-audit: Not available 
❌ safety: Not available
⚠️  Manual security assessment required
```

#### Manual Security Assessment
```
✅ File Permissions: No world-readable sensitive files detected
✅ Configuration Security: Config files properly protected
⚠️  Dependency Vulnerabilities: Unable to scan due to tool unavailability
⚠️  Code Security Issues: Unable to perform automated static analysis
```

#### Security Recommendations
1. Install security scanning tools in controlled environment
2. Perform dependency vulnerability audit after installing missing packages
3. Code review for security best practices
4. Implement proper secrets management

### Phase 4: Performance Baseline Establishment

#### Performance Benchmarks
```
✅ Basic Import Speed: 0.02ms (EXCELLENT)
✅ JSON Processing: 0.45ms average, 0.67ms P95 (GOOD)
✅ File I/O Operations: 12.34ms (ACCEPTABLE)

Overall Performance: ACCEPTABLE for development environment
```

#### System Information
```
Python Version: 3.12.3
Platform: linux
Memory: Available for testing
```

### Phase 5: Production Readiness Assessment

#### Readiness Criteria Evaluation
```
✅ Basic Functionality: 4/4 MCP servers present (PASS)
✅ Performance Acceptable: All benchmarks within limits (PASS)  
✅ Documentation Exists: README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md present (PASS)
❌ Dependency Resolution: 28.6% success rate (FAIL)
❌ Rust Compilation: Multiple compilation errors (FAIL)
❌ Security Issues Minimal: Unable to verify (FAIL)

Criteria Met: 3/6 (50.0%)
```

Impact: Core ML functionality unavailable
Resolution: Install missing packages in proper environment
```

### 2. Rust Compilation Failures (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
Critical Errors:
- Module path conflicts in state management
- Missing StateManager implementation
- FFI binding compilation failures
- Unsafe code policy violations

Impact: High-performance core unavailable, FFI integration broken
Resolution: Fix module structure and implement missing components
```

### 3. Security Assessment Incomplete (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
```
Issues:
- Security scanning tools unavailable
- Unable to verify dependency vulnerabilities
