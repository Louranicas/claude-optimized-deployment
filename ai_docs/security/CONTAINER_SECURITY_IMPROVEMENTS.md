# Container Security Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Docker containers in the Claude-Optimized Deployment Engine, specifically addressing the issue of containers running as root user.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Root User Containers
Previously, several containers were running with root privileges, which poses security risks:
- **Filebeat**: Was explicitly set to run as `user: root`
- **Node-exporter**: Was running as root by default
- Other containers were implicitly running as root

### 2. Security Improvements Implemented

#### Filebeat Service
- **Before**: `user: root`
- **After**: `user: "1000:1000"`
- **Impact**: Filebeat now runs as a non-privileged user, reducing the attack surface

#### Node-exporter Service
- **Before**: No user specified (defaults to root)
- **After**: `user: "65534:65534"` (nobody user)
- **Impact**: Node-exporter runs with minimal privileges while still able to collect metrics

## Configuration Changes

### 1. infrastructure/logging/docker-compose.logging.yml
```yaml
filebeat:
  user: "1000:1000"  # Changed from root
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true  # Prevent privilege escalation
```

### 2. docker-compose.monitoring.yml
```yaml
node-exporter:
  user: "65534:65534"  # Added nobody user
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true  # Prevent privilege escalation
```

## Permission Requirements

### Log Directories
The following directories need proper permissions for non-root containers:
- `/var/log/claude-optimized-deployment`: Application logs (755, owned by 1000:1000)
- `/var/log/filebeat`: Filebeat's own logs (755, owned by 1000:1000)

### Docker Socket Access
Filebeat requires access to Docker socket for metadata collection:
- `/var/run/docker.sock`: Read-only access needed
- Solution: Container user should be added to the docker group on the host

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set up log directory permissions**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_log_permissions.sh
   ```

2. **Start the services**:
   ```bash
   # Logging stack
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/logging/docker-compose.logging.yml up -d
   
   # Monitoring stack
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Verify services are running**:
   ```bash
   # Check logging services
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/logging/docker-compose.logging.yml ps
   
   # Check monitoring services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml ps
   ```

## Testing and Validation

### 1. Verify Non-Root Execution
```bash
# Check Filebeat user
docker exec code-filebeat whoami
# Expected: User with UID 1000

# Check Node-exporter user
docker exec claude-node-exporter whoami
# Expected: nobody
```

### 2. Verify Log Collection
```bash
# Check if Filebeat can write logs
docker logs code-filebeat

# Check if logs are being shipped to Elasticsearch
curl -u elastic:${ELASTIC_PASSWORD} https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

### 3. Verify Metrics Collection
```bash
# Check Node-exporter metrics
curl http://localhost:9100/metrics

# Check Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Containers run with minimal required permissions
2. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Compromised containers have limited system access
3. **Defense in Depth**: Additional security layer in case of application vulnerabilities
4. **Compliance**: Meets security best practices for production deployments
5. **No Privilege Escalation**: `no-new-privileges` flag prevents containers from gaining additional privileges
6. **Clear User Context**: Each container runs with a specific, documented user ID

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Docker Socket Access**: Filebeat still needs Docker socket access for metadata. Consider using Docker API proxy for additional security
2. **Read-Only Root Filesystem**: Consider making container filesystems read-only where possible
3. **Security Scanning**: Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities
4. **Network Policies**: Implement network segmentation between services

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors
If you see permission errors:
1. Run the setup script: `./scripts/setup_log_permissions.sh`
2. Ensure the host directories exist with correct permissions
3. Check container user IDs match host directory ownership

### Docker Metadata Collection Issues
If Filebeat can't collect Docker metadata:
1. Verify Docker socket permissions
2. Consider adding container user to docker group (security trade-off)
3. Alternative: Use Filebeat without Docker metadata enrichment
