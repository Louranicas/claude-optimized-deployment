## Security Implementation Framework

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Security

CODE implements enterprise-grade security for MCP server interactions:

#### Authentication Framework
```python
# MCP Authentication Middleware
class MCPAuthMiddleware:
    async def validate_request(self, tool_name: str, context_id: str) -> bool:
        """Validate MCP tool requests with JWT tokens"""
        
    async def enforce_rbac(self, user_role: str, tool_name: str) -> bool:
        """Enforce role-based access control"""
        
    async def rate_limit_check(self, user_id: str, tool_name: str) -> bool:
        """Per-user, per-tool rate limiting"""
```

#### Security Controls
- ✅ **Tool-Level Authorization**: Granular permissions per MCP tool
- ✅ **Context Isolation**: Secure context boundaries between requests
- ✅ **Request Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for all tools
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all MCP operations
- ✅ **Resource Limits**: Memory, CPU, and time constraints per operation

### Security Best Practices for Development

#### 1. **Secrets Management**
```bash
# Environment Configuration
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" 
export JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 64)"
export DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Never commit secrets to version control
- ✅ Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ Implement secret rotation schedules
- ✅ Use vault solutions for production (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS)

#### 2. **Access Control Implementation**
```python
# Role-Based Access Control
@require_permission("deployment", "execute")
@audit_action("deployment_initiated")
async def deploy_application(current_user: User, deployment_config: DeploymentConfig):
    """Secure deployment endpoint with RBAC and auditing"""
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Implement principle of least privilege
- ✅ Use decorators for consistent permission checking
- ✅ Audit all privileged operations
- ✅ Regular access review and cleanup

#### 3. **Secure Development Lifecycle**
```yaml
# CI/CD Security Pipeline
security_checks:
  - dependency_scanning
  - static_code_analysis
  - container_scanning
  - infrastructure_validation
  - dynamic_security_testing
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Automated security testing in CI/CD
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
- ✅ Regular dependency updates
- ✅ Security training for all developers

#### 4. **Production Deployment Security**
```bash
# Production Security Checklist
□ TLS 1.3 enabled for all endpoints
□ Security headers configured
□ Rate limiting activated
□ Monitoring and alerting deployed
□ Backup and recovery tested
□ Incident response plan activated
```
