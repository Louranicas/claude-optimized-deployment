- **Security Framework**: Comprehensive audit and mitigation systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Memory optimization and circuit breakers
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception hierarchy and recovery

### Development Focus
- Natural language to infrastructure conversion
- Deploy-Code module integration and enhancement
- Actual deployment engine implementation
- Advanced state management
- Enterprise-grade features

## üîç Research-First Development

### The Three-Step Approach (Updated)

Always research, analyze existing patterns, then implement:

```bash
# Step 1: Research
claude "Research best practices for implementing a Terraform wrapper that supports multi-cloud deployments. Look at our existing MCP server patterns, security requirements, and the Circle of Experts integration points."

# Step 2: Analyze and Plan
claude "Based on the research and our existing codebase patterns:
1. Analyze how this fits with our MCP server architecture
2. Consider our exception hierarchy and error handling patterns
3. Plan integration with Circle of Experts for validation
4. Design the module structure following our security guidelines
5. Plan memory optimization strategies"

# Step 3: Implement with Validation
claude "Now implement the Terraform wrapper:
1. Follow our established patterns in src/mcp/
2. Use our exception hierarchy from src/core/exceptions.py
3. Add comprehensive tests following our testing framework
4. Include security validations and audit logging
5. Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience"
```

### Why This Matters

Without explicit research and planning steps, Claude tends to jump straight to coding. For complex problems like deployment engine architecture, the research phase significantly improves the quality of the final implementation. Our experience shows that integrating with existing patterns (MCP, security, monitoring) requires careful planning to maintain consistency and avoid technical debt.

## üß™ Test-Driven Development

### Enhanced TDD Workflow with Project Patterns

```bash
# 1. Write tests first (following our patterns)
claude "Write comprehensive tests for a DeploymentEngine class that should:
- Deploy Docker containers using our MCP docker server
- Track deployment state in our database models
- Support rollback functionality with audit logging
- Handle errors using our exception hierarchy
- Include circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Integrate with Circle of Experts for validation
Use pytest and our testing framework. Follow patterns in tests/. Do NOT implement the class yet."

# 2. Verify tests fail properly
claude "Run the tests and confirm they all fail appropriately. Check that:
- Import errors are specific and helpful
- Test structure follows our conftest.py patterns
- Security and validation tests are included"

# 3. Implement following project patterns
claude "Now implement the DeploymentEngine class to make all tests pass:
- Use our async patterns from src/circle_of_experts/
- Follow our error handling from src/core/exceptions.py
- Include logging using our structured logging patterns
- Add metrics collection for monitoring
- Implement proper cleanup and resource management"

# 4. Refactor and optimize
claude "The tests are passing. Now refactor:
- Apply memory optimization patterns from our core modules
- Add performance monitoring hooks
- Ensure security validations are comprehensive
- Add comprehensive documentation"
```

### Example: Circle of Experts Enhancement (Updated)

```python
# .claude/commands/tdd-expert.md

   - Query processing tests with rate limiting
   - Error handling tests using our exception hierarchy
   - Integration with existing experts in enhanced_expert_manager.py
   - Security validation tests
   - Performance benchmark tests
   - Memory usage tests
2. Run tests and verify they fail appropriately
3. Implement the expert class to pass all tests:
   - Follow patterns in src/circle_of_experts/experts/
   - Use our async patterns and connection pooling
   - Include comprehensive error handling
   - Add audit logging integration
4. Add integration tests with the expert manager
5. Refactor for optimal performance and memory usage
6. Add monitoring and alerting hooks
```
