## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Optimizations

#### SIMD Acceleration (Risk Level: Medium)
**Potential Issues:**
- Hardware compatibility variations
- Performance regression on older CPUs
- Compilation complexity

**Mitigation Strategy:**
```rust
// Feature-gated SIMD with fallbacks
#[cfg(target_feature = "avx2")]
fn optimized_simd_operation(data: &[f32]) -> f32 {
    // SIMD implementation
}

#[cfg(not(target_feature = "avx2"))]
fn optimized_simd_operation(data: &[f32]) -> f32 {
    // Fallback implementation
}
```

#### Zero-Copy Operations (Risk Level: Medium-High)
**Potential Issues:**
- Memory safety concerns
- Complex buffer management
- Platform-specific behavior

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Comprehensive testing on all target platforms
- Memory sanitizer validation
- Gradual rollout with feature flags

### Low-Risk Optimizations

#### Database Query Optimization (Risk Level: Low)
**Mitigation:**
- Query plan analysis before implementation
- Performance benchmark comparison
- Automatic rollback on regression

#### Memory Pool Expansion (Risk Level: Low)
**Mitigation:**
- Gradual pool size increases
- Memory usage monitoring
- Configurable pool parameters
