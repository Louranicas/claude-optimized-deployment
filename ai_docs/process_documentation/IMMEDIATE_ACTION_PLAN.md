```bash
# IMMEDIATE MEMORY FIX
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
# Deploy memory monitoring
pm2 start app.js --max-memory-restart 6G
```
**Responsible Agent**: Agent 6 (Performance Analysis) - O(n²) algorithms identified
**Timeline**: Within 1 hour

---

## 🔥 PHASE 2: INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY (24-48 hours)

### 5. **Container Security Emergency** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Impact**: Docker socket exposure allows host takeover
**Action Required**:
```yaml
# Remove from docker-compose.yml IMMEDIATELY
# volumes:
#   - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  # REMOVE THIS LINE

# Add security contexts to ALL containers
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
**Responsible Agent**: Agent 5 (Infrastructure) - 15+ critical K8s/Docker issues
**Timeline**: Within 8 hours

### 6. **MCP Server Deployment Fix** 🔴 HIGH
**Impact**: 66.7% deployment failure rate - core features unavailable
**Action Required**:
```python
# Fix permission checker interface
class MockPermissionChecker:
    def register_resource_permission(self, resource, permission):
        pass  # Add missing method
    
    def get_user_permissions(self, user_id):
        return []  # Add missing method
```
**Responsible Agent**: Agent 8 (MCP Integration) - root cause analysis complete
**Timeline**: Within 12 hours

### 7. **Deploy-Code Module Emergency Fixes** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Impact**: 39% readiness, resource leaks, unsafe operations
**Action Required**:
```rust
// src/orchestrator/executor.rs - Fix resource leaks
impl Drop for ProcessHandle {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Ensure cleanup
        let _ = self.handle.kill();
    }
}
```
**Responsible Agent**: Agent 2 (Deploy-Code) - 25 critical issues catalogued
**Timeline**: Within 16 hours

---

## ⚡ PHASE 3: ARCHITECTURAL EMERGENCY (48-72 hours)

### 8. **God Object Decomposition** 🔴 HIGH
**Impact**: Single point of failure in Deploy-Code module
**Action Required**: Break into microservices
**Responsible Agent**: Agent 1 (Architecture) - god object anti-patterns identified
**Timeline**: 3 days

### 9. **Code Quality Crisis** 🔴 HIGH  
**Impact**: Complexity 144 (target <15), maintenance nightmare
**Action Required**: Refactor highest complexity files first
**Responsible Agent**: Agent 9 (Code Quality) - technical debt 14-19 weeks
**Timeline**: 5 days

## 🏁 EMERGENCY COMPLETION CRITERIA

**System will remain in EMERGENCY STATUS until:**
1. **All CRITICAL vulnerabilities resolved** (verified by independent security scan)
2. **MCP deployment success >95%** (verified by automated testing)
3. **Memory usage stable <70%** (verified by 24-hour monitoring)
4. **Deploy-Code module >90% functional** (verified by integration tests)
5. **Third-party security audit PASSED** (external validation required)

**ONLY THEN can staged production deployment be considered.**
