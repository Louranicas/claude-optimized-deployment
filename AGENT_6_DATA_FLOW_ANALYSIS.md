# Agent 6: Data Flow Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines the data flow patterns within the CORE (Claude Optimized Resilient Environment) system. The analysis reveals a sophisticated data architecture with multiple layers of abstraction, comprehensive audit trails, and strong data governance controls.

## 1. Data Architecture

### 1.1 Data Models and Schemas

The system employs a **dual-ORM architecture** supporting both SQLAlchemy and Tortoise ORM for maximum flexibility:

#### Core Data Entities:
- **Audit Logs**: Complete system action tracking with tamper-proof signatures
- **Query History**: Circle of Experts query tracking with cost and performance metrics
- **Deployment Records**: Infrastructure change tracking with rollback capabilities
- **Configuration**: Key-value storage with versioning and sensitivity controls
- **User Management**: RBAC-based user system with API key support
- **Metric Data**: Time-series data for Prometheus integration

#### Schema Design Patterns:
```python
# Example: Audit Log Model
class SQLAlchemyAuditLog(Base):
    __tablename__ = "audit_logs"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now(), index=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    action = Column(String(100), index=True)
    resource_type = Column(String(50), index=True)
    resource_id = Column(String(255))
    details = Column(JSON)
    success = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    
    # Composite indexes for performance
    __table_args__ = (
        Index("idx_audit_timestamp_action", "timestamp", "action"),
        Index("idx_audit_user_timestamp", "user_id", "timestamp"),
        Index("idx_audit_resource", "resource_type", "resource_id"),
    )
```

### 1.2 Data Storage Patterns

#### Repository Pattern Implementation:
- **Base Repository**: Abstract repository with common CRUD operations
- **Specialized Repositories**: Domain-specific repositories (QueryHistory, Audit, Metrics, etc.)
- **Connection Pooling**: Advanced pool management with circuit breakers
- **Transaction Management**: Proper locking mechanisms and timeout controls

#### Storage Features:
1. **Parameterized Queries**: Prevention of SQL injection through proper query parameterization
2. **Table/Column Allowlists**: Security through explicit identifier validation
3. **Connection Pool Management**: Adaptive pooling with monitoring
4. **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Fault tolerance for database operations

## 2. Data Flow Patterns

### 2.1 Request/Response Flows

#### API Request Flow:
```
Client Request → Authentication Middleware → Authorization Check → 
Business Logic → Repository Layer → Database → Response Transformation → Client
```

#### Audit Trail Integration:
- Every significant action triggers audit logging
- Request metadata (IP, user agent, session) captured
- Success/failure tracking with error details
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

### 2.2 Event-Driven Data Flows

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration:
```python
# MCP Tool Call Flow
MCP Client → WebSocket/HTTP Transport → MCP Server → 
Tool Execution → Response → Audit Log → Client
```

#### Asynchronous Processing:
- Event queues with bounded sizes (max 1000 events)
- Circuit breaker protection for queue overflow
- High-frequency event sampling for performance
- Ring buffer for high-volume events

### 2.3 Streaming Data Patterns

The system implements sophisticated streaming processors for handling large datasets:

```python
class ChunkedStreamProcessor:
    """Process data in configurable chunks to reduce memory pressure"""
    
    async def process_stream(self, stream: AsyncIterator[T]) -> StreamMetrics:
        chunk = []
        for item in stream:
            chunk.append(item)
            if len(chunk) >= self.chunk_size:
                await self._process_and_output_chunk(chunk)
                chunk.clear()
                # Trigger GC if memory pressure detected
```

## 3. Data Processing & Transformation

### 3.1 ETL/ELT Processes

#### Data Transformation Pipeline:
1. **Input Validation**: Schema validation and sanitization
2. **Transformation**: Business logic application
3. **Enrichment**: Metadata addition and relationship resolution
4. **Output Formatting**: JSON/CSV/Protocol Buffer serialization

#### Backup and Archive Operations:
```python
class DatabaseBackup:
    async def backup_to_json(self, tables: List[str]) -> str:
        """Export tables to JSON with validation"""
        for table_name in tables:
            validated_table = validate_table_name(table_name)
            # Safe query construction with allowlist validation
            
class DatabaseArchiver:
    async def archive_old_data(self, table_name: str, days_to_keep: int):
        """Archive data older than specified days"""
        # Parameterized queries for safety
        # JSON export for compliance
```

### 3.2 Real-Time Processing

#### Metrics Collection:
- Prometheus-compatible metric generation
- Real-time aggregation with cardinality limits
- Sampling for high-frequency metrics
- Memory-efficient buffering

#### Monitoring Data Flow:
```
Application Events → Metrics Collector → Aggregation → 
Prometheus Scrape → Grafana Dashboards → Alerts
```

## 4. Data Integration Patterns

### 4.1 Database Integration

#### Connection Management:
- Async connection pooling with monitoring
- Health checks with circuit breakers
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Pool size optimization based on load

#### Multi-Database Support:
- PostgreSQL for production workloads
- SQLite for development/testing
- Seamless switching via connection strings
- Database-specific optimizations

### 4.2 External System Integration

#### MCP Server Integration:
```python
class MCPClient:
    async def call_tool(self, tool_name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Call MCP tool with request/response tracking"""
        request = MCPRequest(method=MCPMethod.TOOLS_CALL, params={...})
        response = await self.transport.send_request(request)
        # Automatic retry and error handling
```

#### API Integration Patterns:
- Rate limiting with token buckets
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Response caching for efficiency
- Error transformation and logging

## 5. Data Governance & Privacy

### 5.1 Audit Logging

#### Comprehensive Audit System:
```python
class AuditLogger:
    async def log_event(self, event_type: AuditEventType, **kwargs):
        """Log audit event with tamper protection"""
        event = AuditEvent(...)
        event.details["signature"] = self._sign_event(event)
        # HMAC-based signature for integrity
```

#### Audit Features:
- HMAC signatures for tamper detection
- Event correlation and session tracking
- Automatic alert triggering for security events
- Compliance-ready export formats (JSON, CSV)

### 5.2 Data Privacy Controls

#### Input Sanitization:
```python
def sanitize_for_logging(value, level=SanitizationLevel.STRICT):
    """Sanitize data before logging to prevent injection"""
    # Remove control characters
    # Escape special sequences
    # Truncate oversized inputs
```

#### Privacy Features:
- PII detection and masking
- Configurable retention policies
- Right-to-be-forgotten support
- Encrypted sensitive field storage

### 5.3 Access Control

#### RBAC Implementation:

    def __init__(self, max_size: int, ttl: int):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()
        self._timestamps = {}
        self._lock = threading.RLock()
```

#### Cache Hierarchy:
1. Application-level caches (LRU)

    # Length checks
    # Character set validation
    # Injection pattern detection
```

### 7.2 Data Consistency

- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Compensation logic for rollbacks

## 8. Monitoring & Observability

### 8.1 Data Flow Metrics

#### Key Metrics:

### 8.2 Tracing

#### Distributed Tracing:
```python
class TracingManager:
    async def create_span(self, operation_name: str):
        """Create trace span with context propagation"""
        span = self.tracer.start_span(operation_name)
        span.set_tag("service", "code-deployment")
```

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 SQL Injection Prevention

#### Parameterized Queries:
```python
# Safe query construction
query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id")
result = await session.execute(query, {"user_id": user_id})
```

### 9.2 Data Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest:
- Database-level encryption
- Sensitive field encryption
- Key rotation policies

#### Encryption in Transit:
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Certificate pinning for critical services
- Mutual TLS for service-to-service
