## 1. Docker Security Analysis

### 1.1 Docker Configuration Assessment

#### Strengths Identified:
‚úÖ **Multi-stage builds** implemented in all Dockerfiles for attack surface reduction  
‚úÖ **Non-root users** properly configured (UID 1001/65534)  
‚úÖ **Read-only root filesystem** enforced in most containers  
‚úÖ **Capability dropping** (ALL capabilities dropped)  
‚úÖ **Health checks** implemented with proper timeouts  
‚úÖ **Minimal base images** (Alpine/slim variants used)  
‚úÖ **Security contexts** properly configured  

#### Critical Vulnerabilities:

üî¥ **HIGH RISK: Dockerfile.secure Health Check Dependency**
- **File:** `/home/louranicas/projects/claude-optimized-deployment/Dockerfile.secure` (Line 49)
- **Issue:** Health check uses `requests` library without ensuring it's installed
- **Impact:** Container startup failures, potential DoS
- **Recommendation:** Replace with urllib or ensure requests is in requirements.txt

üî¥ **HIGH RISK: Privileged Build Operations**
- **File:** `/home/louranicas/projects/claude-optimized-deployment/Dockerfile.rust-production` (Lines 32-47)
- **Issue:** Rust compilation runs as root with wide permissions
- **Impact:** Supply chain attacks, privilege escalation
- **Recommendation:** Use dedicated build user with minimal permissions

üü° **MEDIUM RISK: Hardcoded Secrets**
- **Files:** Multiple Dockerfiles contain placeholder credentials
- **Issue:** Risk of secrets being committed to version control
- **Impact:** Credential exposure
- **Recommendation:** Use Docker secrets or external secret management

üü° **MEDIUM RISK: Base Image Vulnerabilities**
- **Issue:** Base images may contain known CVEs
- **Impact:** Inherited vulnerabilities
- **Recommendation:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning and updates

### 1.2 Container Runtime Security
