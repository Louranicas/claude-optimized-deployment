# Circle of Experts Workflow Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Circle of Experts system in the CORE environment implements a sophisticated multi-AI collaboration framework that orchestrates responses from diverse expert systems (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.) to provide comprehensive, consensus-driven solutions. The system features Rust acceleration, MCP integration for real-time data enhancement, and intelligent query routing with consensus mechanisms.

## 1. Expert System Architecture

- SUPERGROK/GROQ: Fast inference, general analysis
- OLLAMA: Local, private inference (fallback)
- OPENROUTER: Flexible routing to multiple models
- HUGGINGFACE: Experimental features
- HUMAN: Manual expert responses, consensus reports
```

### 1.2 Expert Selection Patterns

The ExpertFactory implements sophisticated selection logic:

1. **Priority-Based Selection**: 
   - PRIMARY (score: 100): Claude, GPT-4, DeepSeek, OpenRouter
   - SECONDARY (score: 75): Gemini, Groq
   - FALLBACK (score: 50): Ollama, LocalAI
   - EXPERIMENTAL (score: 25): HuggingFace

2. **Query-Aware Selection**:
   - Query type compatibility matching
   - Cost optimization for low-priority queries
   - Quality preference for critical queries
   - Automatic fallback to free experts when paid APIs unavailable

3. **Dynamic Expert Health Checks**:
   - Real-time availability monitoring
   - Automatic failover mechanisms
   - Performance-based selection adjustments

## 2. Collaboration Patterns

### 2.1 Multi-Expert Query Patterns

The system implements several collaboration patterns:

1. **Parallel Consultation**:
   ```python
   # All experts process queries simultaneously
   - Reduces overall response time
   - Enables diverse perspectives
   - Implements timeout protection
   ```

2. **Consensus Building**:
   ```python
   # Rust-accelerated consensus analysis
   - Agreement level calculation (high/medium/low)
   - Common recommendation extraction
   - Dissenting view identification
   - Confidence-weighted aggregation
   ```

3. **Streaming Responses**:
   ```python
   # Real-time response collection
   - Async iteration over incoming responses
   - Early result availability
   - Memory-efficient processing
   ```

### 2.2 Consensus Mechanisms

The ResponseCollector implements sophisticated consensus algorithms:

1. **Confidence-Based Consensus**:
   - Average confidence calculation
   - Variance analysis for agreement level
   - Threshold-based classification

2. **Recommendation Aggregation**:
   - Frequency-based common recommendation identification
   - Minimum agreement threshold (50% by default)
   - Unique limitation collection

3. **Rust Acceleration**:
   - Native performance for large response sets
   - Parallel processing of consensus metrics
   - Automatic fallback to Python implementation

### 2.3 Conflict Resolution Strategies

1. **Confidence Weighting**: Higher confidence responses have more influence
2. **Majority Voting**: Common recommendations require >50% agreement
3. **Expert Type Prioritization**: Primary experts have implicit higher weight
4. **Dissenting View Preservation**: Unique perspectives are tracked separately

## 3. Integration Architecture

   ```

2. **Response Enhancement**:
   ```python
   # Real-time data augmentation
   - MCP tool integration for each expert

   ```python
   # Claude Code can directly call MCP tools
   - Brave web/news search
   - Infrastructure management
   - DevOps operations
   ```

### 3.2 Async Coordination Patterns

1. **Semaphore-Based Concurrency Control**:
   - Maximum concurrent queries: 5 (configurable)
   - Memory budget enforcement: 512MB default
   - Automatic query queuing

2. **Memory-Efficient Processing**:
   - WeakValueDictionary for query tracking
   - TTL-based cache eviction (4 hours)
