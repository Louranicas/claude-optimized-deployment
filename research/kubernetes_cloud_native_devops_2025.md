## Kubernetes Best Practices and Patterns

### GitOps Evolution (2024-2025)

#### Key Tools and Adoption
- **CNCF-Graduated Projects**: Argo CD and Flux dominate the GitOps landscape
  - **Argo CD**: Chosen for powerful UI and straightforward app management
  - **Flux**: Preferred for modular, flexible workflows and advanced multi-source syncs
- **Adoption Rate**: 91% of CNCF survey respondents already using GitOps (2023), with 67% more planning adoption

#### Core GitOps Principles
1. **Declarative Everything**: Define desired state in YAML/HCL, not step-by-step actions
2. **Git as Source of Truth**: Only Git holds official configuration
3. **Pull/Merge Requests**: All changes through versioned PRs for auditability
4. **Continuous Reconciliation**: GitOps tools continuously watch Git and reconcile environments

#### Best Practices
- **Repository Management**: One repository per team, use branches for additional needs
- **Folder Structure**: Use folders for configuration variants instead of branches
- **Testing**: Implement kpt validator functions before applying configs
- **Pull vs Push**: Pull-based GitOps (Argo CD, Flux) is the predominant pattern

### Kubernetes Operators

#### When to Use Operators
- **Best Practice**: Use existing Operators when appropriate vs. ad-hoc scripting
- **Caution**: "Operators are not always the best fit for every deployment scenario" (CNCF, 2024)
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Deployment requirements, operational capabilities, resource constraints

#### Production Considerations
- Operators offer powerful automation but add complexity
- Simpler deployment methods may be more appropriate for straightforward use cases
- Critical for complex stateful applications and custom resources
