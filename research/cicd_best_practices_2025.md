## Progressive Delivery and Deployment Strategies

### Core Strategies

#### 1. Canary Deployments
- Gradual traffic shifting (typically 10% increments every 5 minutes)
- Automatic rollback on metric degradation
- Representative user sampling critical for success

#### 2. Feature Flags
- Enable/disable features without redeployment
- Real-time flag updates for immediate changes
- Granular user targeting based on attributes

#### 3. Ring Deployments
- Expanding deployment rings from small to large user groups
- Risk mitigation through gradual exposure
- Clear rollback procedures at each ring

### Tool Ecosystem

#### LaunchDarkly (2025 Leader)
- Real-time flag updates without redeployment
- Deep framework integration
- Comprehensive analytics and experimentation
- Automatic kill switches based on performance thresholds

#### Flagger (Kubernetes-native)
- CNCF project, part of Flux family

- Automatic promotion based on metrics (Prometheus, Datadog, SkyWalking)

### Best Practices
1. Start with small, representative user groups
2. Implement circuit breakers and kill switches
3. Use metrics-driven decision making
4. Combine with service mesh for traffic management

## Pipeline as Code Best Practices

### Cross-Platform Principles
1. **Version Control**: Store all pipeline definitions alongside code
2. **Declarative Syntax**: Prefer declarative over imperative definitions
3. **Error Handling**: Implement retries with exponential backoff
4. **Access Control**: Platform-specific RBAC implementation

### Platform-Specific Guidelines

#### Jenkins

- Implement shared libraries for reusable components

#### Tekton (Kubernetes-native)
- Use Pipelines-as-Code (PAC) for automatic task resolution
- Leverage Kubernetes primitives (Pods, CRDs)
- Implement proper parameter handling with type validation
- Support for local tasks, Tekton Hub, and remote URLs

#### GitHub Actions
- YAML-based workflow management
- Native GitHub integration
- Extensive marketplace of actions
- Matrix builds for parallel testing

#### GitLab CI
- Comprehensive DevOps platform integration
- Pre-built templates library
- Built-in security scanning capabilities
- Excellent Kubernetes integration

## DevSecOps and Shift-Left Security

### Security Testing Tools Integration

#### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- **When**: Early in development, IDE integration
- **Targets**: Source code vulnerabilities
- **Challenges**: False positives (up to 80%), alert fatigue
- **Integration**: CI/CD pipeline at build stage

#### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- **When**: Post-deployment to test environments
- **Targets**: Runtime vulnerabilities, configuration issues
- **Strengths**: Real-world attack simulation
- **Modern Approach**: DAST-first to reduce false positives

#### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
- **Focus**: Third-party dependencies, open-source components
- **Output**: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- **Integration**: Build process, continuous monitoring
- **Automation**: Auto-upgrade vulnerable dependencies

#### Container Scanning
- **Integration Points**: Pre-registry, runtime
- **Tools**: Trivy, Snyk, Aqua Security
- **Best Practice**: Block vulnerabilities before registry push

### 2025 Security Trends
- **34%** rise in vulnerability exploitation (Verizon 2025)
- Shift from developer-centric to runtime-focused security
- Automated remediation becoming standard
- Supply chain security critical focus area
