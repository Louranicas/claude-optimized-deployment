# Generate dashboard
dashboard_data = tracker.generate_dashboard_data()
```

**Features:**
- Multi-dimensional quality analysis
- Automated gate validation
- Trend tracking and prediction
- Real-time quality monitoring
- Historical data management

### 2. Quality Configuration (`quality_config.yaml`)

**Centralized configuration** for all quality standards and thresholds.

```yaml
quality_gates:
  critical:
    syntax_error_rate:
      threshold: 0.0
      operator: "equals"
      blocking: true
    
  high:
    line_coverage:
      threshold: 85.0
      operator: "greater_equal"
      blocking: true
```

### 3. Quality Automation (`Makefile.quality`)

**Comprehensive automation** for all quality processes.

```bash
# Main quality commands
make quality-all          # Complete pipeline
make quality-check        # All checks
make quality-fix          # Auto-fix issues
make quality-report       # Generate reports

# Specific analysis
make lint                 # Code linting
make security-scan        # Security analysis
make test-all            # All tests

## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

### Quality Thresholds

Customize quality thresholds in `quality_config.yaml`:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  critical:
    syntax_error_rate:
      threshold: 0.0        # Zero tolerance
      blocking: true
      
  high:
    line_coverage:
      threshold: 85.0       # Minimum 85%
      blocking: true
      
    type_hint_coverage:
      threshold: 80.0       # Target 80%
      blocking: false       # Warning only
```

### Tool Configuration

**Customize static analysis tools:**

```yaml
static_analysis:
  python:
    bandit:
      enabled: true
      severity_threshold: "medium"
      
    mypy:
      enabled: true
      strict: true
      
    black:
      enabled: true
      line_length: 88
```

### Environment-Specific Settings

```yaml
environments:
  development:
    quality_gates:
      blocking_gates: ["syntax_error_rate"]
      
  production:
    quality_gates:
      blocking_gates: ["syntax_error_rate", "critical_vulnerabilities", "line_coverage"]
