## Hardware Resource Utilization

### CPU Utilization (16 Threads)
- **Parallel Test Execution**: 12 threads for concurrent testing
- **Resource Monitoring**: 2 threads for system monitoring
- **Test Coordination**: 2 threads for test orchestration

### Memory Management (32GB RAM)
- **Test Processes**: 16GB allocated for test execution
- **Test Data**: 8GB for test data and fixtures
- **System Buffer**: 8GB reserved for system operations

### Storage Optimization (NVMe SSD)
- **Test Artifacts**: Fast read/write for test results
- **Temporary Data**: Efficient handling of temporary test files
- **Database Testing**: High-speed database operations

## Testing Framework Components

### 1. Rust Unit Testing Framework
- Cargo-based testing with custom harness
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Mock-based testing with mockall
- Benchmark testing with criterion

### 2. Python Unit Testing Framework
- Pytest-based testing with fixtures
- Async testing support
- Mock testing with unittest.mock
- Property testing with hypothesis

### 3. Integration Testing Framework
- Cross-language FFI testing
- Service integration testing
- Database integration testing
- External API integration testing

### 4. Performance Testing Suite
- Micro-benchmarks for individual functions
- Macro-benchmarks for system components
- Memory usage profiling
- Concurrent performance testing

### 5. Security Testing Framework
- Static analysis integration
- Dynamic vulnerability scanning
- Input validation testing
- Authentication and authorization testing

## Test Categories and Standards

### Test Classification
1. **Unit Tests**: >90% code coverage target
2. **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered
3. **End-to-End Tests**: All user journeys covered
4. **Performance Tests**: All performance-critical components
5. **Security Tests**: All security-sensitive components
