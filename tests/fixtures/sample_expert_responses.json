    "content": "Based on my analysis of your infrastructure requirements, I recommend implementing a multi-layered optimization strategy focusing on caching, connection pooling, and horizontal scaling.",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "reasoning": "The current architecture shows signs of bottlenecks in the data layer and API gateway. By implementing caching at multiple levels and enabling connection pooling, we can reduce latency by approximately 40%. Horizontal scaling will provide better resilience and handle traffic spikes more effectively.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data with a 5-minute TTL",
      "Enable database connection pooling with a pool size of 20-50 connections",
      "Deploy applications using Kubernetes HPA with CPU threshold at 70%",
      "Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage",
      "Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for better observability"
