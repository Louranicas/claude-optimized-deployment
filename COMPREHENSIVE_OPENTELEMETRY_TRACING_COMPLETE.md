## üîß Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization
```python
from src.monitoring.tracing import init_comprehensive_tracing

# Initialize with auto-instrumentation and configuration
tracing_manager = init_comprehensive_tracing(
    app=fastapi_app,
    engine=sqlalchemy_engine
)
```

### Business Context Tracking
```python
from src.monitoring.tracing import BusinessMetrics

# Create span with business context
business_metrics = BusinessMetrics(
    user_id="user_123",
    tenant_id="tenant_456",
    customer_tier="premium",
    business_value=1000.0,
    feature_flags={"new_feature": True}
)

with tracing_manager.enhanced_span(
    "premium_operation",
    business_metrics=business_metrics
