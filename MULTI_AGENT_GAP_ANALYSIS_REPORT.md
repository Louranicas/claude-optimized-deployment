- **Impact**: 80% manual coordination overhead

### **3. Memory Management Inefficiencies**
- Fragmented monitoring across multiple systems
- No cross-agent memory sharing optimization
- Reactive vs predictive memory management
- **Impact**: 40-60% memory waste, frequent OOM errors

### **4. Tool Chain Limitations**

- Missing context propagation between tool calls
- Limited error handling in multi-tool workflows
- **Impact**: Isolated tool execution, no sophisticated automation

### **5. Agent Coordination Gaps**
