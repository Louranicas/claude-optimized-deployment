Contemporary social work practice increasingly demands critical examination of Western theoretical frameworks when working with culturally diverse communities (Mafile'o & Vakalahi, 2020). This case study critically analyses the application of systems theory within a multicultural women's support group, interrogating both its utility and limitations through a decolonising lens. The analysis demonstrates how participatory approaches can transform traditional theoretical applications while revealing persistent colonial assumptions embedded within ostensibly neutral frameworks."""

The multicultural women's support group emerged from participatory action research identifying social isolation among refugee and migrant women in Western Sydney. Comprising 15 women from Syrian, Afghani, Sudanese, and Latin American backgrounds, the group challenged conventional support structures through its evolution from service provision to collective advocacy. Systems theory, particularly Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model as reconceptualised by Rosa and Tudge (2020), initially provided a framework for understanding the complex intersections of migration, gender, and cultural adaptation.

However, recent critiques highlight how systems theory's presumed neutrality masks Western epistemological dominance (Choate et al., 2021). The theory's emphasis on equilibrium and adaptation potentially obscures structural violence and historical trauma inherent in forced migration experiences. Indigenous scholars particularly critique systems theory's failure to acknowledge colonial disruption of traditional kinship systems and its implicit validation of settler-colonial institutions as legitimate "systems" requiring adaptation rather than resistance (Bennett et al., 2022)."""

Applying systems theory revealed both insights and contradictions. Initial mapping of microsystem interactions illuminated how trauma contagion operated within the group, with one member's immigration detention narrative triggering collective re-traumatisation (Posselt et al., 2023). However, women resisted the theory's individualising tendencies, reconceptualising "systems" through their own cultural frameworks. Sudanese participants introduced Ubuntu philosophy, reframing interdependence not as systemic dysfunction but as collective strength challenging Western notions of pathological enmeshment (Mayaka & Truell, 2021).

Mesosystem analysis exposed how institutional racism operated across multiple domains. Women's experiences navigating Centrelink, healthcare, and education systems revealed what Quijano's (2021) decolonial theory terms the "coloniality of power"—seemingly neutral bureaucratic processes that systematically marginalise non-Western ways of being. The exosystem level particularly demonstrated how immigration policies created what Menjívar (2021) conceptualises as "legal violence," where administrative decisions profoundly impact lives without direct participation or recourse.

Macrosystem examination unveiled the intersection of patriarchal structures across cultures with Australian settler-colonial systems. However, women rejected deficit-based analyses, instead employing what Thiong'o (2022) terms "decolonising the mind" to critique both Western therapeutic assumptions and patriarchal elements within their own communities without reinforcing racist stereotypes about their cultures."""

The group's evolution exemplified decolonising practice principles. Rejecting the facilitator-participant hierarchy, women established rotating leadership drawing on their diverse expertise—Syrian women taught trauma-informed breathing techniques from their war experiences, while Latin American members introduced testimonio methodology for collective healing (Gutierrez Rodriguez, 2023). This challenged systems theory's implicit expert-client dynamics and Western assumptions about professional knowledge supremacy.

Participatory evaluation revealed systems theory's colonising potential when uncritically applied. The framework's diagnostic orientation risked reproducing what Tuck and Yang (2021) term "damage-centered research," focusing on dysfunction rather than resistance and resilience. Women collaboratively developed alternative frameworks incorporating circular rather than hierarchical system conceptualisations, reflecting Indigenous and Eastern philosophies where time, relationships, and healing operate non-linearly (Watego, 2021).

The group transformed from support mechanism to political collective, organising community forums on immigration policy reform and establishing peer advocacy networks. This evolution challenged systems theory's adaptation focus, instead embodying what hooks (2022) describes as "radical healing"—not adjusting to oppressive systems but collectively imagining and creating alternative structures. Women's refusal to be confined within service-user identities demonstrated what Freire's contemporary interpreters call "critical hope"—pragmatic action toward systemic transformation rather than individual adaptation (Duncan-Andrade, 2020)."""

This case study illuminates critical considerations for applying Western theories in multicultural contexts. Systems theory offers valuable insights when radically reconstructed through participants' epistemologies, but requires constant vigilance against its colonising potential. Effective practice demands what Nelson (2023) terms "theoretical humility"—recognising all frameworks as culturally situated rather than universal truths.

Decolonising practice transcends cultural sensitivity, requiring fundamental reimagining of knowledge production and validation. Practitioners must facilitate spaces where diverse worldviews reshape theoretical frameworks rather than being absorbed within them. This involves uncomfortable recognition that professional expertise itself represents colonial knowledge hierarchies requiring deconstruction (Tamburro & Tamburro, 2024).

Future practice must center collective transformation over individual adaptation, political consciousness over pathological framings, and multiple knowledge systems over theoretical orthodoxy. As this group demonstrated, genuine decolonising practice enables communities to move from objects of professional intervention to subjects of collective liberation—fundamentally challenging social work's institutional positioning within colonial structures while imagining radical alternatives rooted in justice, reciprocity, and collective healing."""
