## Case Study: Systems Theory Through a Decolonising Lens

### Context
The Multicultural Women's Support Group comprises 15 refugee women from Syrian, Afghani, Sudanese, and Latin American backgrounds meeting weekly. Initially applying Bronfenbrenner's ecological model (Rosa & Tudge, 2020) revealed interconnected challenges across system levels.

### Theoretical Application and Critical Analysis
Microsystem analysis illuminated trauma contagion when immigration detention narratives triggered collective re-traumatisation (Posselt et al., 2023). However, participants resisted deficit interpretations, introducing Ubuntu philosophy that reframed interdependence as collective strength (Mayaka & Truell, 2021).

Mesosystem examination exposed institutional racism across services—what Quijano (2021) terms "coloniality of power." The exosystem demonstrated Menjívar's (2021) "legal violence" through immigration policies impacting lives without participation.

Critical reflection revealed systems theory's colonising potential. Its adaptation focus risked depoliticising structural violence. Indigenous participants highlighted how the framework obscures colonial disruption while legitimising settler institutions requiring "adaptation" rather than resistance (Bennett et al., 2022).

### Decolonising Practice
The group rejected facilitator-participant hierarchies, establishing rotating leadership. Syrian women shared war-derived breathing techniques; Latin American members introduced testimonio methodology (Gutierrez Rodriguez, 2023). This challenged professional knowledge supremacy.

Women transformed from support recipients to advocates, organising policy forums and peer networks—embodying hooks' (2022) "radical healing" through creating alternatives rather than adapting to oppression.

### Effectiveness Evaluation
The participatory approach fostered critical consciousness and collective action. Success metrics shifted from individual adaptation to collective empowerment: forums organised, policies challenged, networks established. This demonstrated effective mezzo practice requires supporting communities as transformation agents, not intervention objects (Tamburro & Tamburro, 2024).
