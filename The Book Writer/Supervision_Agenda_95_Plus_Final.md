# Supervision Agenda and Case Study: Systems Theory in Multicultural Women's Support Group

**Organization:** Harmony House Community Services, a registered NGO providing culturally responsive support services across Western Sydney since 2015. Our mission centers on empowering refugee and migrant communities through participatory, trauma-informed approaches aligned with our Anti-Oppressive Practice Framework (Policy 3.2).

## Supervision Agenda

As Group Facilitator within Harmony House's Community Wellbeing Program, I present these carefully prioritized items reflecting critical practice needs:

### 1. Managing Secondary Trauma and Vicarious Resilience (25 minutes)
**Rationale:** Extended time needed following Tuesday's critical incident where Amira's detention narrative triggered collective re-traumatisation, requiring immediate debriefing per Critical Incident Policy 4.1.

• Process my emotional response to holding space for collective trauma while maintaining professional boundaries
• Review implementation of Harmony House's Trauma-Informed Care Protocol (Policy 5.3) with cultural adaptations
• Develop self-care plan aligned with Staff Wellbeing Framework, incorporating Sudanese cleansing rituals suggested by participants
• Explore vicarious resilience observed when women transformed trauma into collective strength

### 2. Navigating Theoretical Tensions in Decolonising Practice (20 minutes)
**Rationale:** Addressing friction between funding body's requirement for evidence-based practice and participants' resistance to Western frameworks requires strategic planning.

• Examine my discomfort when participants rejected systems theory's individualising focus, calling it "colonial mind-mapping"
• Develop documentation strategies honouring Ubuntu philosophy while meeting Department of Communities' outcome metrics
• Align alternative evaluation methods (story circles, collective murals) with Harmony House's Participatory Evaluation Guidelines (Policy 7.2)
• Consider integrating Yarning Circles methodology as culturally congruent alternative framework

### 3. Ethical Boundaries in Systemic Advocacy (20 minutes)
**Rationale:** Women's evolution from support recipients to activists challenges organizational risk management while embodying our empowerment mission.

• Address my role conflict when facilitating became "co-conspiring" in organizing protests against Centrelink policies
• Clarify application of Advocacy Guidelines (Policy 6.4) when group activities exceed individual support mandate
• Review partnership MOU with Settlement Services International regarding scope of systemic advocacy
• Plan professional development in community organizing within Practice Development Budget allocation

### 4. Implementing Rotating Leadership Models (15 minutes)
**Rationale:** Participant-led governance model requires formal integration into program structure.

• Evaluate last month's transition where I became "cultural student" to Syrian breathing instructor
• Develop framework preventing cultural appropriation while enabling knowledge exchange per Cultural Safety Protocol (Policy 8.1)
• Address insurance implications of participant-led activities with Risk Management Committee
• Create succession planning for my evolving role from expert to co-learner

## Case Study: Systems Theory Through a Decolonising Lens

### Context and Theoretical Application

The Multicultural Women's Support Group emerged from Harmony House's 2023 community consultations identifying isolation among refugee women. Initially, I confidently applied Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model (Rosa & Tudge, 2020) to map interconnected challenges across fifteen participants from Syrian, Afghan, Sudanese, and Latin American backgrounds.

However, a pivotal moment occurred when Faduma challenged my microsystem analysis of "dysfunctional family dynamics," declaring: "You see sickness where we see survival." This confrontation exposed how systems theory's presumed neutrality masks Western epistemological dominance (Choate et al., 2021). Her introduction of Ubuntu philosophy—"I am because we are"—reframed interdependence as collective strength rather than pathological enmeshment (Mayaka & Truell, 2021).

### Critical Incidents and Decolonising Evolution

The mesosystem analysis revealed institutional racism across services, exemplifying Quijano's (2021) "coloniality of power." When documenting Centrelink's rejection of Amal's spousal support claim due to "insufficient evidence" of her Syrian marriage, I recognised Menjívar's (2021) "legal violence"—administrative decisions devastating lives without recourse.

A transformative incident occurred during session twelve when participants established rotating leadership. As Lucia led testimonio circles (Gutierrez Rodriguez, 2023) and Safaa taught trauma-informed breathing, I experienced disorientation losing my "expert" status. Journaling revealed my unconscious attachment to professional knowledge supremacy—a humbling recognition of internalized colonial attitudes despite anti-oppressive training.

The group's evolution from support circle to advocacy collective challenged Harmony House's service delivery model. When women organized a community forum on immigration policy, I faced ethical dilemmas balancing organizational risk management with genuine empowerment. Their transformation embodied hooks' (2022) "radical healing"—creating alternatives rather than adapting to oppressive systems.

### Effectiveness Through Decolonising Metrics

Traditional evaluation metrics proved inadequate. Participants rejected pre/post questionnaires as "colonial counting," proposing collective murals documenting their journey. This challenged funding requirements but revealed authentic transformation: three policy submissions drafted, two community forums organized, peer support networks established across four language groups (Tamburro & Tamburro, 2024).

Critical reflection exposed systems theory's limitations—its adaptation focus depoliticizes structural violence while legitimizing settler institutions as "systems" requiring adjustment rather than resistance (Bennett et al., 2022). Indigenous participants particularly critiqued how it obscures colonial disruption of kinship networks (Watego, 2021).

Yet when reconstructed through participants' epistemologies, systems thinking offered insights. Women created circular rather than hierarchical system maps, reflecting Indigenous non-linear temporalities (Tuck & Yang, 2021). This theoretical humility—recognizing all frameworks as culturally situated—became essential to decolonising practice (Nelson, 2023).

## Synthesis: Key Supervision Needs

This case illuminates three critical supervision priorities: (1) developing personal strategies for holding complexity when professional frameworks prove inadequate; (2) advocating for organizational policy evolution that genuinely enables community-led transformation; (3) documenting alternative evidence of impact that honors diverse ways of knowing while meeting funding requirements. Future practice must center collective liberation over individual adaptation, acknowledging that genuine decolonising work requires continuous critical self-reflection and institutional courage.
