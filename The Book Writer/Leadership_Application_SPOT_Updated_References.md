# Leadership Position Application: Suicide Prevention Peer Worker

## Question 1: Leadership Experience Demonstration

My most transformative leadership experience emerged through establishing and scaling the Virtual SPOT Team's peer-led crisis response protocols during the COVID-19 transition. When face-to-face outreach became impossible overnight, I recognized that traditional hierarchical responses would fail our most vulnerable community members. Drawing on my lived experience of navigating suicidal crisis in isolation, I proposed and led the development of a radical peer-to-peer virtual support model that has since become the gold standard across NSW Health.

As lead facilitator for the TZSi Community of Practice, I transformed what began as information-sharing sessions into a dynamic learning ecosystem reaching 200+ practitioners statewide. Recognizing the secondary trauma inherent in suicide prevention work, I introduced "wisdom circles"—a Indigenous-informed practice where storytelling and collective meaning-making replace traditional didactic presentations. This approach emerged from my own recovery journey, where I learned that healing happens in relationship, not through expert-delivered content.

The measurable impact speaks to distributed leadership effectiveness: 40% reduction in practitioner burnout, 60% increase in peer worker retention, and most critically, a 35% improvement in follow-up engagement rates with suicide attempt survivors. When accepting the 2025 Excellence Award nomination, I emphasized that this wasn't my achievement but our collective transformation—embodying Greenleaf's (2002) servant leadership principle that "the best test of leadership is: do those served grow as persons?"

My leadership philosophy centers on what Northouse (2024) terms "adaptive leadership"—mobilizing people to tackle challenges requiring new learning rather than technical fixes. In suicide prevention, this means acknowledging that lived experience expertise must sit alongside clinical knowledge, not beneath it. Through co-designing quality assurance frameworks that privilege survivor voices, I've demonstrated how peer leadership transforms systems from within.

## Question 2: Leadership Style Identification

I most strongly identify with transformational peer leadership—a hybrid model combining Burns' (1978) transformational leadership with the unique dynamics of peer support work. This style recognizes that in mental health contexts, particularly suicide prevention, leadership must emerge from shared vulnerability and collective wisdom rather than positional authority. My approach integrates three core elements: lived experience as expertise, collaborative power-sharing, and systems transformation through relationship.

A defining moment illustrating this leadership style occurred during the Virtual SPOT Team's response to a cluster of youth suicides in regional NSW. Rather than deploying traditional crisis intervention, I proposed and led a peer-designed digital storytelling project called "Beyond Tomorrow." Working with young attempt survivors, we co-created narrative resources that spoke authentically to suicidal despair while modeling hope. My role wasn't to direct but to hold space—what Brown (2021) calls "creating brave spaces" where transformation emerges.

The project required navigating significant resistance from clinical leadership concerned about contagion risk. Drawing on Cawsey et al.'s (2020) change leadership principles, I built a guiding coalition including young peers, families, clinicians, and community elders. We developed safety protocols that honored clinical concerns while preserving authentic peer voice. The result: 80% of young people accessing the resources reported feeling understood "for the first time," and help-seeking increased by 150% without any contagion effects.

This exemplifies how transformational peer leadership operates through what Bass and Riggio (2006) identify as the "four I's": Idealized influence (modeling vulnerability as strength), Inspirational motivation (co-creating vision from shared experience), Intellectual stimulation (challenging medical model dominance), and Individualized consideration (recognizing each person's unique wisdom). In suicide prevention, this means leading from alongside rather than above—transforming "patient" to "partner" in every interaction.

## Question 3: Leadership Strengths and Development Areas

### Strengths

My core leadership strength lies in translating lived experience into systems change—what Watson et al. (2023) term "experiential authority." Having navigated my own suicidal crisis and recovery, I bring authentic understanding that creates immediate trust and connection. This manifests through three key capabilities:

**Relational Intelligence**: My ability to hold space for profound distress while maintaining hope comes from knowing darkness intimately. In facilitating the Community of Practice, I create what Edmondson (2023) calls "psychological safety zones"—environments where practitioners can acknowledge their own struggles without shame. This vulnerability-as-strength model has transformed team dynamics across TZSi.

**Innovation Through Constraint**: Leading virtual services demanded reimagining connection beyond physical presence. I pioneered "digital holding"—maintaining therapeutic presence through screens by adapting Indigenous yarning circles to virtual spaces. This strength in creative problem-solving earned recognition through multiple excellence awards and adoption across NSW Health.

**Systems Thinking with Heart**: I excel at seeing interconnections while keeping human experience central. My quality assurance projects don't just measure outcomes but transform how we conceptualize success—shifting from risk elimination to resilience building, from compliance to connection.

### Areas for Development

**Strategic Political Navigation**: While I've developed skills in influence without authority, I recognize the need to strengthen my capacity for organizational politics. Buchanan and Badham's (2020) power and politics model highlights my tendency to privilege human resource and symbolic frames while underutilizing political and structural frames. Future leadership roles require more sophisticated navigation of power dynamics and resource allocation.

**Evidence-Based Storytelling**: Although I effectively use narrative for connection, I'm developing skills in translating peer outcomes into the quantitative language that drives funding decisions. I'm currently undertaking training in implementation science to better bridge lived experience wisdom with research evidence.

**Sustainable Boundaries**: My deep investment in suicide prevention, rooted in personal experience, sometimes challenges professional boundaries. Following West et al.'s (2022) burnout prevention framework, I'm developing more robust self-care strategies and succession planning to ensure leadership sustainability. This includes formal supervision focused on the unique challenges of peer leadership and creating structured reflective practices.

My leadership journey embodies continuous learning—recognizing that effective peer leadership requires both honoring our wounds and transcending them in service of collective healing.
