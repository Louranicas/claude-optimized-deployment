# Supervision Agenda and Case Study: Systems Theory in Multicultural Women's Support Group

## Supervision Agenda

As facilitator of the Multicultural Women's Support Group, I have prepared the following agenda items for supervision, carefully aligned with my role and organisational context:

### 1. Managing Secondary Trauma and Group Contagion (30 minutes)
• Discussion of recent incident where one member's immigration detention narrative triggered collective re-traumatisation across the group
• Seeking guidance on trauma-informed facilitation techniques that honour cultural expressions of distress
• Review organisational policies on critical incident debriefing and referral pathways
• Develop strategies for maintaining facilitator wellbeing while holding space for collective trauma

### 2. Navigating Theoretical Tensions in Practice (20 minutes)
• Examine challenges applying Western theoretical frameworks with culturally diverse groups
• Discuss participants' resistance to systems theory's individualising tendencies
• Explore how to document practice outcomes using organisational frameworks while honouring participants' Ubuntu philosophy and collective conceptualisations
• Align alternative evaluation methods with funding body requirements

### 3. Addressing Institutional Advocacy and Role Boundaries (20 minutes)
• Review ethical dilemmas arising from women's experiences of institutional racism across Centrelink, healthcare, and education systems
• Clarify organisational position on systemic advocacy versus individual support
• Discuss my role boundaries when group evolves from support to political collective action
• Plan professional development in anti-oppressive practice and policy advocacy

### 4. Developing Culturally Responsive Leadership Models (20 minutes)
• Evaluate effectiveness of rotating leadership model introduced by participants
• Address power dynamics and my changing role from facilitator to co-participant
• Align participatory approaches with organisational risk management requirements
• Create framework for sharing cultural knowledge while avoiding appropriation

## Case Study: Applying Systems Theory Through a Decolonising Lens

The Multicultural Women's Support Group emerged from participatory consultations identifying isolation among refugee women from Syrian, Afghan, Sudanese, and Latin American backgrounds. Initially, systems theory, particularly Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model (Rosa & Tudge, 2020), provided frameworks for understanding interconnected challenges. However, critical analysis revealed how the theory's presumed neutrality masks Western epistemological dominance (Choate et al., 2021).

### Theoretical Application and Tensions

Microsystem analysis illuminated trauma contagion patterns, yet women resisted individualising interpretations. Sudanese participants introduced Ubuntu philosophy, reframing interdependence as collective strength rather than dysfunction (Mayaka & Truell, 2021). This challenged Western pathological conceptualisations and highlighted the supervision need to address theoretical tensions.

Mesosystem examination exposed what Quijano (2021) terms "coloniality of power"—bureaucratic processes systematically marginalising non-Western ways of being. The exosystem demonstrated Menjívar's (2021) "legal violence," where immigration policies impact lives without participation. These findings prompted agenda items on institutional advocacy and role boundaries.

### Decolonising Practice Evolution

The group's transformation exemplified decolonising principles through rotating leadership honouring diverse expertise. Syrian women shared trauma-informed breathing from war experiences; Latin American members introduced testimonio methodology (Gutierrez Rodriguez, 2023). This challenged professional knowledge supremacy, necessitating supervision discussions on changing facilitator roles.

Participatory evaluation revealed systems theory's colonising potential when uncritically applied. The diagnostic orientation risked reproducing "damage-centered research" (Tuck & Yang, 2021). Women developed circular rather than hierarchical conceptualisations, reflecting Indigenous philosophies where relationships operate non-linearly (Watego, 2021).

### Critical Reflection on Effectiveness

Systems theory proved valuable when reconstructed through participants' epistemologies but required vigilance against colonising potential. The framework's adaptation emphasis risked depoliticising structural violence. Indigenous participants critiqued how it obscures colonial disruption while legitimising settler institutions as "systems" requiring adaptation rather than resistance (Bennett et al., 2022).

The group evolved from support mechanism to political collective, organising policy forums and establishing peer advocacy networks. This embodied hooks' (2022) "radical healing"—creating alternatives rather than adapting to oppressive systems. Their transformation challenged organisational frameworks prioritising individual outcomes over structural change.

Effectiveness shifted from individual adaptation indicators to collective empowerment measures—forums organised, policy submissions drafted, networks established. This challenged conventional evaluation frameworks, highlighting supervision needs around alternative documentation methods aligned with funding requirements.

The participatory approach fostered critical consciousness while revealing institutional constraints limiting systemic change. Genuine decolonising practice enabled women to transform from service recipients to community advocates, fundamentally challenging social work's positioning within colonial structures (Tamburro & Tamburro, 2024).

This case demonstrates that applying Western theories in multicultural contexts demands theoretical humility—recognising all frameworks as culturally situated (Nelson, 2023). Future practice must center collective liberation over individual adaptation, political consciousness over pathological framings, and multiple knowledge systems over theoretical orthodoxy.
