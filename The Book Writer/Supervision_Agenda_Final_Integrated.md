## Case Study: Applying Systems Theory Through a Decolonising Lens

### Context and Theoretical Application

The Multicultural Women's Support Group emerged from participatory consultations identifying isolation among refugee women from Syrian, Afghani, Sudanese, and Latin American backgrounds. Systems theory, particularly Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model (Rosa & Tudge, 2020), initially provided frameworks for understanding interconnected challenges. However, critical analysis revealed how systems theory's presumed neutrality masks Western epistemological dominance (Choate et al., 2021).

Microsystem analysis illuminated trauma contagion patterns, where immigration detention narratives triggered collective re-traumatisation (Posselt et al., 2023). Yet women resisted individualising interpretations, introducing Ubuntu philosophy that reframed interdependence as collective strength rather than dysfunction (Mayaka & Truell, 2021). This challenged Western notions of pathological enmeshment, demonstrating how uncritical theoretical application can perpetuate colonial assumptions.

Mesosystem examination exposed institutional racism across Centrelink, healthcare, and education systems—what Quijano (2021) terms "coloniality of power." Women's experiences revealed how bureaucratic processes systematically marginalise non-Western ways of being. The exosystem particularly demonstrated Menjívar's (2021) concept of "legal violence," where immigration policies profoundly impact lives without participation or recourse.

### Decolonising Practice and Participatory Evaluation

The group's evolution exemplified decolonising principles through rotating leadership that honoured diverse expertise. Syrian women shared trauma-informed breathing techniques from war experiences, while Latin American members introduced testimonio methodology for collective healing (Gutierrez Rodriguez, 2023). This challenged professional knowledge supremacy inherent in traditional facilitator-participant hierarchies.

Participatory evaluation revealed systems theory's colonising potential when uncritically applied. The framework's diagnostic orientation risked reproducing "damage-centered research" focusing on dysfunction rather than resistance (Tuck & Yang, 2021). Women collaboratively developed alternative frameworks incorporating circular rather than hierarchical conceptualisations, reflecting Indigenous and Eastern philosophies where relationships operate non-linearly (Watego, 2021).

The group transformed from support mechanism to political collective, organising immigration policy forums and establishing peer advocacy networks. This embodied hooks' (2022) "radical healing"—not adapting to oppressive systems but creating alternatives. Their evolution demonstrated Duncan-Andrade's (2020) "critical hope"—pragmatic action toward systemic transformation rather than individual adaptation.

### Critical Reflection and Practice Implications

Systems theory proved valuable when radically reconstructed through participants' epistemologies but required vigilance against colonising potential. Effective practice demands "theoretical humility"—recognising all frameworks as culturally situated rather than universal (Nelson, 2023). This case illuminated how decolonising practice transcends cultural sensitivity, requiring fundamental reimagining of knowledge production.

The framework's emphasis on adaptation risked depoliticising structural violence inherent in forced migration. Indigenous participants particularly critiqued how systems theory obscures colonial disruption of kinship systems while legitimising settler-colonial institutions as "systems" requiring adaptation rather than resistance (Bennett et al., 2022). This revealed how ostensibly neutral theories can perpetuate oppression through diagnostic rather than liberatory orientations.

Genuine decolonising practice enabled women to transform from service recipients to community advocates, fundamentally challenging social work's positioning within colonial structures. The group's refusal to remain within service-user identities demonstrated collective agency that transcended individual therapeutic goals. Their praxis embodied Tamburro and Tamburro's (2024) vision of decolonised social work—facilitating spaces where diverse worldviews reshape rather than assimilate into professional frameworks.

### Effectiveness Evaluation

The participatory approach proved highly effective in fostering critical consciousness and collective action. Women developed sophisticated analyses of intersecting oppressions while maintaining cultural pride. However, institutional constraints limited systemic change possibilities, highlighting tensions between grassroots transformation and organisational limitations.

Success metrics shifted from individual adaptation indicators to collective empowerment measures—community forums organised, policy submissions drafted, peer support networks established. This challenged conventional evaluation frameworks prioritising individual outcomes over structural change. The group's evolution demonstrated that effective mezzo practice requires supporting communities as agents of transformation rather than objects of intervention.

Future practice must center collective liberation over individual adaptation, political consciousness over pathological framings, and multiple knowledge systems over theoretical orthodoxy. This case study demonstrates that applying Western theories in multicultural contexts demands constant critical reflexivity, genuine power-sharing, and commitment to structural transformation rooted in justice and collective healing.
