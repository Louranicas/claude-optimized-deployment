## Case Study: Systems Theory in the Multicultural Women's Support Group

### Context
The Multicultural Women's Support Group emerged from community consultations identifying isolation among newly arrived refugee and migrant women. Meeting weekly for two hours, the group includes 12-15 women from diverse cultural backgrounds including Syrian, Afghani, Sudanese, and Latin American communities. As facilitator, I applied systems theory to understand and work with the complex dynamics within this group.

### Applying Systems Theory

Systems theory provided a framework for understanding the multiple interconnected systems affecting group members (Bronfenbrenner, 2005). Rather than viewing women's challenges as individual problems, I mapped the various systems impacting their lives:

**Microsystem interactions:** The group itself became a microsystem where women developed reciprocal relationships. I observed how trauma experiences from one member triggered responses in others, creating feedback loops that initially reinforced isolation patterns (Payne, 2014).

**Mesosystem connections:** By facilitating discussions about family-community interfaces, women identified how cultural expectations from their ethnic communities sometimes conflicted with Australian institutional requirements. This systems perspective helped normalize their struggles as systemic rather than personal failures (Healy, 2014).

**Exosystem influences:** We explored how immigration policies, employment systems, and educational institutions impacted members without their direct participation. One woman's experience navigating Centrelink illuminated how bureaucratic systems can perpetuate marginalization (Ife, 2013).

**Macrosystem considerations:** Cultural values, racism, and gender expectations emerged as powerful forces. The systems lens helped women see how patriarchal structures from both origin and host cultures intersected to limit their agency (Dominelli, 2018).

Through this framework, I designed interventions targeting multiple system levels. We created buddy systems (microsystem), organized family inclusion events (mesosystem), conducted advocacy training for institutional navigation (exosystem), and facilitated critical consciousness discussions about cultural and gender norms (macrosystem) (Teater, 2014).

### Evaluating Effectiveness Through a Decolonising Lens

The application of systems theory proved both valuable and problematic when evaluated through decolonising and participatory principles:

**Strengths:** Systems theory's holistic perspective aligned with many women's collectivist worldviews, contrasting with individualistic Western therapeutic approaches. It validated their emphasis on family and community interconnectedness. The framework supported participatory practice by positioning women as experts in their own systems (Tamburro, 2013).

**Limitations:** However, systems theory's Western academic origins required critical adaptation. The theory's tendency toward neutral analysis risked depoliticizing experiences of racism and colonial trauma. Women from Indigenous backgrounds particularly noted how systems theory could obscure power relations and historical injustices (Baskin, 2016).

**Participatory adaptations:** We collaboratively reconstructed the framework, incorporating Indigenous concepts of relationality and Middle Eastern understandings of family systems. Women created their own visual representations of their support systems using cultural symbols, moving beyond Western diagnostic models (Gray, Coates & Yellow Bird, 2013).

**Decolonising outcomes:** This approach fostered critical consciousness about how colonial systems perpetuate marginalization. Women began organizing collective responses to systemic barriers, transforming from service recipients to community advocates. The group evolved into a mutual aid network challenging traditional helper-client dynamics (Wehbi, 2018).

### Implications for Practice

This case demonstrates that while systems theory offers valuable insights for mezzo practice, its application must be critically examined through decolonising perspectives. Effective group work requires flexibility to adapt Western theories to diverse worldviews, genuine power-sharing in knowledge creation, and commitment to collective action against oppressive systems.
