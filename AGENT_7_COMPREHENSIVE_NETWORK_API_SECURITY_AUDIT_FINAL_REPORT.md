## Critical Weaknesses Identified

### 1. Secret Management Failures (7 HIGH findings)
**Category:** Secret Management  
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access

**Issues Identified:**
- Hardcoded database passwords in Docker Compose files
- JWT secrets embedded in environment variables
- Grafana admin passwords in plain text
- API keys exposed in configuration files

**Evidence:**
- `mcp-typescript-api`: JWT_SECRET, DB_PASSWORD
- `postgres`: POSTGRES_PASSWORD 
- `grafana`: GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- Multiple services with embedded credentials

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Replace all hardcoded secrets with Docker secrets or external secret management
2. Implement secret rotation procedures
3. Audit all configuration files for additional exposed credentials
4. Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager

### 2. Weak TLS/SSL Configuration
**Category:** Cryptographic Security  
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception

**Issues Identified:**
- TLSv1 protocol enabled (deprecated and vulnerable)
- Weak cipher suites in NGINX configuration
- Missing HSTS headers in some configurations

**Evidence:**
```nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;  # TLSv1 should be removed
```

**Remediation:**
- Remove TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols
- Update cipher suites to exclude weak algorithms
- Implement proper certificate management

### 3. Network Security Gaps
**Category:** Network Exposure  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Impact:** Unauthorized network access, lateral movement

**Issues Identified:**
- Privileged ports (80, 443) directly exposed
- Overly broad network policies in Kubernetes
- Bridge networks allowing potential container escape
- LoadBalancer services with external exposure

**Network Architecture Analysis:**

#### Docker Network Configuration
- **mcp-frontend:** 172.20.0.0/24 (Bridge, External Access)
- **mcp-backend:** 172.21.0.0/24 (Bridge, Internal Services) 
- **mcp-data:** 172.22.0.0/24 (Bridge, Data Layer)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement network segmentation with internal-only networks
- Use ingress controllers instead of direct port exposure
- Strengthen Kubernetes network policies with specific pod selectors

### Service Mesh Analysis

#### Container Services Discovered:
1. **mcp-typescript-api** (Port 3000)
   - Database connectivity: PostgreSQL
   - Cache layer: Redis  
   - Security: Basic auth implementation

2. **mcp-learning-system** (Port 8001)
