        content="""
        As a Performance Engineering Expert, analyze the MCP infrastructure system with the following characteristics:
        
        **System Architecture:**
        - 10+ MCP servers with 51+ tools
        - Async Python implementation with asyncio
        - Docker, Kubernetes, Security scanning integration
        - Multi-AI consultation system (Circle of Experts)
        - Concurrent operation support up to 200+ tasks
        
        **Current Performance Patterns:**
        - Desktop Commander: File operations, shell commands
        - Docker MCP: Container lifecycle management
        - Kubernetes MCP: Cluster operations and deployment
        - Security Scanner: Vulnerability assessment and scanning
        - Azure DevOps: CI/CD pipeline automation
        - Monitoring: Prometheus integration
        - Communication: Slack notifications
        
        **Performance Questions:**
        1. What are the most critical performance bottlenecks in an async MCP-based infrastructure system?
        2. How should we optimize connection pooling and resource management for 10+ concurrent MCP servers?
        3. What are the best practices for async I/O optimization in tool execution?
        4. How can we implement intelligent throttling and rate limiting?
        5. What metrics should we monitor for proactive performance management?
        
        Provide specific, actionable recommendations for optimizing this architecture.

        As a Scalability Expert, assess the scaling characteristics of our MCP infrastructure system:
        
        **Current Scale:**
        - 10+ MCP servers running concurrently
        - 51+ individual tools across different domains
        - Support for 200+ concurrent operations

        **Scaling Challenges:**
        - Memory usage growth with concurrent operations
        - Connection limits and file descriptor management
        - CPU utilization under heavy load
        - Error propagation and failure handling at scale
        
        **Key Questions:**
        1. How should our system scale horizontally vs vertically?
        2. What are the theoretical and practical limits of our current architecture?
        3. How can we implement auto-scaling for MCP server instances?
        4. What patterns should we use for load balancing across multiple MCP servers?
        5. How do we maintain consistency and state management at scale?
        6. What are the best practices for graceful degradation under high load?
